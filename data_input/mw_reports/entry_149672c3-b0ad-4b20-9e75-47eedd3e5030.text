About IRSEM
The Institute for Strategic Research (IRSEM), founded in 2009, is a research institute attached to the French
Ministry for the Armed Forces (formerly the Ministry of Defense). With a team of about 50 civilian and military employees, a majority of which had been trained at the doctoral level, it is the primary War Studies center in the Francophone world. Along with conducting internal research for the Ministry for the Armed Forces and external research
aimed at the scientific community on questions of defense and security, IRSEM supports young researchers and
contributes to higher military education and to the public debate.
IRSEM produces independent analyses that do not constitute official positions. The views expressed in this
report are therefore those of its authors and in no way that of IRSEM, the Ministry for the Armed Forces, or the
French government.

FOREWORD

The influence strategies and operations presented in this report have been implemented
by the Chinese regime, not by China or the Chinese. Just as we recommended in the 2018
CAPS-IRSEM report to prefer “the Kremlin” to “Russia,” to avoid conflating the government and the people,1 we will therefore preferably use “the Party-State” or “Beijing” rather
than “China.” “The Party-State” designates the regime as a whole (with its three cornerstones: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the state, and the People’s Liberation Army
(PLA)). Any occurrence of “China,” therein used for convenience, refers to the regime and
not to the Chinese society or to the Chinese people.
This vocabulary precaution has become necessary because both those who dare criticize
the CCP’s practices are immediately accused by the Chinese authorities, state media, and
social media trolls of being “anti-China” (“反华”2) “anti-Chinese,” “racist,” “xenophobic,”
or “Sinophobe” – exactly as the Kremlin brands its detractors as “Russophobes.” All are
“labels that polarize and kill productive conversation.”3 We anticipate being the targets of
such attacks, and we make clear straightaway that, in either case, what is questioned is neither a population, nor a country, but rather the practices of an authoritarian government. It
is possible to criticize one without denigrating the other. In conflating the two, the regime
claims to speak for the “Chinese people” which, whether in China or abroad (albeit with
different means), is often the first to criticize CCP practices.
From this perspective, those who deny the reality or impact of the influence operations
described in this volume and those who, on the opposite end of the spectrum, describe “China”
as an “enemy” or speak about a “clash of civilizations” should be rejected. In fact, both are
playing into Beijing’s hands: an overtly hostile attitude conflating the government and the people
feeds an anti-Chinese sentiment that certainly lingers in certain areas (generally places with large
diasporic communities) and at certain times (during the Covid-19 pandemic, for instance). This
allows the Party-State to kill two birds with one stone: it presents itself as the savior and protector of the Chinese living abroad, thus extending its influence over them, and it denounces any
criticism of the regime as being “anti-Chinese” and therefore “racist.”

2. The China Media Project found 79 occurrences of the term “anti-China” in the People’s Daily in 2020, a sharp
increase compared to the 2010s (between 10 and 30 yearly). The frequent use of this term highlights the tensions inside
the regime and the heightened perception of risks among the Party’s leaders. 2008 was the last time a similar number
was found (82). That said, and despite the sudden rise, we remain far from the levels reached during important periods
of tensions, such as under Jiang Zemin after the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, following the
EP-3E incident in 2001 (more than 100 occurrences), or during the Sino-Indian War of 1962-1963 (more than 200).

This explains this preliminary vocabulary clarification: the problem is not “China,” it
is not an “enemy” (the Party is actually the one dividing the world into “friends” – those
who support its interests – and “enemies” – those who dare criticize it4) and there is no
“clash of civilizations.” The problem is not a philosophical difference between two equally
valid options, a supposedly “Confucian” China or the international “liberal” order. The
problem, according to historian Frank Dikötter, is that the “CCP remains, structurally, a
Leninist one-party state [that tries to undermine] anything and everything opposed to it
at home and abroad.”5 What we are confronted with, in the words of Clive Hamilton and
Mareike Ohlberg, is not “some Confucian ‘other,’ but an authoritarian regime, a Leninist
political party replete with a central committee, a politburo and a general secretary backed
by enormous economic, technological and military resources. The real clash is between the
CCP’s repressive values and practices, and the freedoms enshrined in the UN’s Universal
Declaration of Human Rights: the freedom of speech, assembly, religion and belief; freedom from persecution; the right to personal privacy; and equal protection under the law.
The CCP rejects each of these, in words or in deeds.”6
Finally, it is important to specify that this report was not commissioned by the Ministry
or the government, but that it was initiated by the authors. Only a minority of IRSEM’s
work is produced in response to orders from the Ministry of the Armed Forces. For the
rest, the Institute freely chooses its subjects. In this case, it was the authors who, in 2019, in
the wake of the publication of the CAPS-IRSEM report on Information Manipulation (2018),
decided to work on the Chinese case specifically, only to quickly discover that they needed
to broaden the focus from the informational field to that of influence as a whole. The study
of influence strategies has been one of IRSEM’s research axes since 2017. The present
work is therefore part of a series of publications (→ p. 650).

PRELIMINARY NOTE

In this report, all Chinese terms (i.e. from mainland China) are transliterated according
to the rules of Hanyu Pinyin, except for several words which are used in common parlance
and could be potentially incomprehensible with this method of transliteration. For example, the French text uses Canton for Guangzhou, Pékin for Beijing and Nankin for Nanjing.
On the other hand, we have used the Hanyu Pinyin transcription for Mao Zedong instead
of Mao Tse-tung, which we consider outdated. For Taiwanese terms and proper nouns the
situation is more complex. Taiwan has long used the Anglophone transliteration system
known as Wade-Giles. In 2002, the Republic of China developed an indigenous transliteration system, Tongyong Pinyin, which was not widely adopted, certain cities opting for
the continental Pinyin and most media continuing to use Wade-Giles. We therefore tried to
comply with the most common uses. Finally, Hong Kong names are written according to
the Romanization rules for Cantonese adopted by the Hong Kong government.
Works are cited first in the original language and then, in parentheses, in English. Unless
stated otherwise, English translations are our own. In general, we have translated into
English all the names of Chinese institutions, except if an official English translation exists
or when an institution is known by its English name.
The departments of the CCP Central Committee are sometimes named “Central
Departments” (Organization, Propaganda, United Front Work, and International Affairs).
In this report, an affiliation with the Central Committee is implicit: we did not specify that
they are “central” departments at every occurrence.
When writing without additional precision, “dollar” refers to the American dollar. Sums
in American dollars are generally not converted in euros, but all other currencies are.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

For a long time, it could be said that China, unlike Russia, sought to be loved rather than to
be feared; that it wanted to seduce, project a positive image of itself in the world, and arouse admiration. Today, Beijing has not given up on seduction, on its attractiveness, and on its ambition
to shape international norms. Not “losing face” remains very important for the CCP. And yet,
Beijing is also increasingly comfortable with infiltration and coercion: its influence operations
have been considerably hardened in recent years and its methods increasingly resemble Moscow’s. The Party-State has entered a “Machiavellian moment” in the sense that Beijing now
appears to believe that, as Machiavelli wrote in The Prince, “it is better to be feared than loved.”
This evolution shows a “Russification” of Chinese influence operations. And our report
analyzes this evolution, with the ambition of covering the entire spectrum of its tools of influence, from the most benign (public diplomacy) to the most malign – which means interfering
in other countries’ affairs (clandestine activities). To do so, our analysis proceeds in four parts,
successively presenting the concepts, actors, actions pertaining to this moment, and it ends with
several case studies.
1. The concepts that are important to understand Chinese influence operations include the
“United Front” – a CCP policy that consists in eliminating internal and external enemies, controlling groups that could defy its authority, constructing a coalition around the Party to serve
its interests, and projecting its influence abroad – and the “Three warfares,” which represent
the core of China’s “political warfare,” i.e. a form of non-kinetic proneness to conflict aimed at
overcoming an opponent without a fight through the creation of an environment favorable to
China. A wartime and peacetime undertaking, it encompasses public opinion, psychological, and
legal warfare (the latter being close to what is called “lawfare” in English).
A Soviet concept is also useful to describe Beijing’s repertoire: “active measures,” which
includes disinformation, counterfeiting, sabotage, discredit operations, destabilizing foreign governments, provocations, false-flag operations and manipulation aimed at weakening social cohesion, the recruitment of “useful idiots,” and the creation of front organizations.
2. The main actors implementing Chinese influence operations are emanations from the
Party, the State, the Army, and the companies. Within the Party, this includes the Propaganda
Department, which oversees ideology, controls the entire media spectrum and all the cultural
production in the country; the United Front Work Department (UFWD), with its twelve offices reflecting its main targets; the International Liaison Department (ILD), which maintains
relations with foreign political parties; the 610 Office, which has agents across the world acting
outside any legal framework to eliminate the Falun Gong movement. The Chinese Communist
Youth League (CYL) should also be included in this group, serving at once as a link toward
young people, as an incubator for future Party executives, and as a force that can be mobilized
when needed – even if it is not a formal structure of the Party but rather a mass organization.

15

Within the state, two bodies in particular are involved in influence operations: The Ministry
of State Security (MSS), which is the main civilian intelligence agency, and the Taiwan Affairs
Office (TAO), in charge of the propaganda aimed at Taiwan.
Within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the Strategic Support Force (SSF) is at the
forefront, especially through its Network Systems Department. It has the resources and is entrusted with missions in the informational domain. More precisely, the principal actor identified
in this domain is Base 311, headquartered in Fuzhou, which is dedicated to the implementation
of the “Three Warfares” strategy. It also operates media companies as civilian covers and a fake
hotel to hide a training center.
Finally, public and private companies play an important role in collecting the data needed
to decide who should be targeted by influence operations, when, and how. Infrastructures are
particularly useful in data collection – buildings and submarine cables for instance – as are new
technologies: digital platforms such as WeChat, Weibo and TikTok, companies like Beidou and
Huawei, and databases that provide insight into what researchers call China’s “techno-authoritarianism” or “digital authoritarianism” are all used to prepare and feed influence operations
abroad. The Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, which has apparently
inherited intelligence missions previously entrusted to the former 2APL, should also be included
in this list. However, due to insufficient sources, this institution is not covered in the report.
3. The actions carried out by Beijing in its influence operations abroad pertain to two main
and non-mutually exclusive objectives: first, to seduce and captivate foreign audiences by
crafting a positive representation of China, which can be illustrated by four specific narratives
(the Chinese “model,” its tradition, benevolence, and strength); and then, and above all, to
infiltrate and coerce. Infiltration aims at slowly penetrating the opposing societies to hamper
the very possibility of an action contrary to the Party’s interests. Coercion corresponds to the
progressive enlargement of the Chinese “punitive” or “coercive” diplomacy toward a policy of
systematic sanctions against any state, organization, company, or individual that threatens the
Party’s interests. Both are generally carried out via a web of intermediaries. Overall, these practices target the following categories:
- Diasporas, with the dual objective of controlling them – so that they do not represent a
threat for the Chinese power (Beijing carries out a transnational campaign of repression which,
according to the NGO Freedom House, is the “most sophisticated, global, and complete in the
world”) – and mobilizing them to serve its interests.
- The media, as Beijing’s explicit goal is to establish “a new world media order.” Indeed, the
government has invested €1.3 billion annually since 2008 to impose a tighter control over its
global image. The major Chinese media outlets have a global presence, in several languages, on
several continents, and on all social networks, including those blocked in China (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram), and they invest large amounts of money to augment their digital audience artificially. Beijing also seeks to control the Chinese-language outlets abroad, which
has proven so successful that the CCP now effectively enjoys a near-monopoly among them, and
it also seeks to control the mainstream media. Finally, the Party-State is interested in controlling
the containers, exerting its influence over each step along the global information supply chain,
targeting televisions, digital platforms, and smartphones.
- Diplomacy, with a focus on two aspects. First, influence over international organizations
and norms: Beijing deploys classic diplomatic resources along with clandestine influence operations (economic and political pressure, cooptation, coercion, and corruption) to strengthen its
influence. Second, the so-called “wolf-warrior” diplomacy: it refers to more aggressive postures
adopted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ spokespersons and a dozen diplomats. These attacks
take both classic and relatively new forms, notably relying on the use of social networks and
on an uninhibited recourse to invective, admonition, even intimidation. Overall, this aggressive
turn of the Chinese diplomacy has proven counter-productive and it has largely contributed to
16

the abrupt deterioration of China’s global image in recent years. This evolution is probably sustainable for the actors involved, as the objective is less to conquer the hearts and minds than to
please Beijing.
- The economy: an economic dependence is often the first lever China uses. Economic coercion then takes very different forms: a ban from the Chinese domestic market, embargos, trade
sanctions and restrictions on domestic investment, quotas imposed on regions highly dependent
on Chinese tourists, or mass boycotts. Besides, Beijing increasingly imposes censorship as a prerequisite to access its domestic market; many companies end up bowing under pressure.
- Politics, with the goal of penetrating target countries to influence public policymaking
mechanisms. Maintaining direct relationships with political parties and influential political figures
allows the Party-State to infiltrate the target countries, to gather official and unofficial support
there, and to circumvent eventual blockages within the governments by using opposition or “retired” public figures. Beijing also interferes with elections (over the last decade, China may have
interfered in at least 10 elections in 7 countries).
- Education, via universities first and foremost, which are one of the main targets of the
Party’s influence efforts. Its principal levers are: financial dependence, leading to self-censorship
in the universities; surveillance and intimidation of Chinese students, university instructors and
administrators on foreign campuses; imposed modifications in course content, teaching materials, or programmed events; and shaping Chinese Studies, by encouraging self-censorship and
punishing critical researchers. The Party-State also uses universities to acquire knowledge and
technology, via legal and overt means, such as joint research programs, or illegal and covert
actions, like theft and espionage. In a context of civil-military fusion, certain joint programs or
researchers holding positions in dozens of Western universities involuntarily aid Beijing build
weapons of mass destruction or surveillance technologies which are used to oppress the Chinese
population. On this topic, several scandals broke out in public in 2020 and 2021.
Finally, there is another important actor of Chinese influence in education tied to the universities: the Confucius Institutes and Classrooms that have opened all around the world and which,
under the guise of teaching Chinese language and culture, have heightened the dependency, or
subjection, of certain universities to China, damaged academic freedom. They may have occasionally been used for espionage.
- Think tanks: the Chinese strategy in this domain is two-pronged. Beijing seeks to establish
overseas branches of Chinese think tanks, and to take advantage of local relays that may themselves be think tanks, with three possible scenarios: occasional partners acting as amplifiers on
local markets of ideas, circumstantial allies that spread the Party’s narratives, and accomplices
that share a common worldview and convergent interests with the CCP.
- Culture: first via the production and export of cultural products, such as films, TV series,
music, and books – all powerful tools of seduction. Influence can also be exerted on foreign
cultural productions, especially filmmakers, with the example of Hollywood: to avoid upsetting Beijing and hence maintain an access to the enormous Chinese domestic market, many
American movie studios censor themselves, cutting or modifying movie scenes. Some are even
overzealous, casting Chinese characters for the “good” roles. Being denied access to the Chinese
market is almost certain for any artist who criticizes the Party-State. Via other types of pressure,
Beijing also hopes to encourage artists to modify their work or, for those exhibiting elsewhere in
the world, to simply stop, or even to do the work of Chinese censors.
- Information manipulation, resorting to fake accounts on social networks to spread the
Party’s propaganda in the media, trolls and astroturfing (to simulate spontaneous popular movements), and to numerous “internet commentators” (falsely labeled the “50 cent army”) that
are paid to “guide” public opinion. Generally controlled by the PLA or the CYL, trolls defend,
attack, stir controversy, insult, or harass their targets. Another way to simulate authenticity is to
have content published by third parties in exchange for money (content farms, purchase of messages, of influence over an account, of an account or a page, or recruitment of “influencers”).
17

Since 2019, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube no longer refrain from identifying coordinated
campaigns originating in China. Hence, tens of thousands of fake accounts have been suspended: some had long been “dormant,” others had been bought or stolen, most of them amplifying
Chinese propaganda and attacking the United States (in Chinese and in English). Some accounts
have profile pictures generated by artificial intelligence – a now regularly-observed practice in
Chinese operations on social networks. Additionally, an important aspect of these campaigns is
that they do not simply defend China: the promotion of the Chinese model goes hand in hand
with the debasement of other models, especially liberal democracies, as Russian influence operations have done for years. The PLA is at the heart of these maneuvers, using social networks
to conduct “open” influence operations and circulating propaganda on the one hand, often aiming at deterrence and psychological warfare; and to conduct clandestine and hostile operations
against foreign targets on the other hand.
- Other levers: Beijing also uses citizen movements in its influence operations – especially
separatist (New Caledonia, Okinawa) and pacifist groups (No Cold War) – Chinese tourists,
influencers (including Western YouTubers), and foreign academics, as well as hostages, since
Beijing has deployed a “hostage diplomacy.”
4. The case studies are introduced in concentric circles. Taiwan and Hong Kong constitute
the first front in Beijing’s “political warfare”: they are outposts, training grounds, “R&D labs” for
Chinese operations which are subsequently refined and applied to other targets worldwide – not
unlike what Georgia and Ukraine meant for Russian operations. A first widening of the circle of
Chinese operations targeted Australia and New Zealand. A second step was to aim for the rest
of the world, particularly – but not exclusively – Europe and North America. This part introduces four cases – Taiwan, Singapore, Sweden, and Canada – and two operations, which targeted
Hong Kong protestors in 2019 and framed the Covid-19 as an American creation in 2020.
Finally, the conclusion comes back to this notion of a “Machiavellian moment” in two steps.
First, to confirm that there has indeed been a “Russification” of Chinese influence operations
since about 2017: the parallel had already been made in 2018 during the Taiwanese municipal
elections, and later during the 2019 Hong Kong crisis; but the world only became aware of the
problem in 2020 with the Covid-19 pandemic. The three components of this Russification are
then laid out: Beijing draws inspiration from Moscow on several levels (the existing Chinese
military literature acknowledges that, for the PLA, Russia is a model to emulate on such operations). Yet, differences obviously remain between the two, and there is also a certain degree of
cooperation.
Last but not least, the conclusion seeks to assess the effectiveness of this new Chinese posture and concludes that, if it brought certain tactical successes, it has been a strategic failure overall, China being its own worst enemy in terms of influence. The abrupt degradation of Beijing’s
reputation since the arrival of Xi Jinping, particularly in the last couple of years, confronts China
with a growing unpopularity problem that may indirectly come to weaken the Party, including
vis-à-vis its own population.

INTRODUCTION

For a long time, the best China watchers, particularly those based in the outposts that
are Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as the intelligence services of a certain number of
Western countries, have warned of the CCP’s hegemonic and revisionist ambitions.1
Their warnings were not taken seriously by most decision-makers, who held a naïve belief
in the Chinese “peaceful rise” theory and were overconfident about the superiority of the
democratic model. As the CCP opened itself to the world, and with its greater economic
integration, people thought it would “normalize” itself, i.e. liberalize itself politically. Those
who did not believe in this evolution were generally too consumed by the Russian threat or
terrorism to pay attention to China.
Therefore, taking advantage of the spirit of engagement that emanated from the rest of
the world, the CCP was able to consolidate its global influence, in almost total peace
and quiet, by investing widely and massively, creating economic dependencies, developing
trade partnerships as well as cultural relations, in each country via an extraordinarily dense
network of local Chinese associations and stakes in a growing number of international
organizations, media outlets, and so on. Today, faced with the depth and density of this
network across all regions and sectors, many have come to understand that globalization
has not liberalized the Chinese regime: it has impressively developed the Chinese
economy and its power incidentally, without weakening the Party. As one of us wrote
elsewhere, “the notion according to which China would soften with the development of
economic exchange was an illusion. It has in fact become more aggressive.”2
First came a phase of increased self-confidence or assertiveness following the
2008 economic crisis, from which Beijing profited to consolidate its power. A second
followed with the rise to power of Xi Jinping in 2012. With him, the CCP’s control over
the Chinese society has considerably increased in all its dimensions, putting an end to the
subtle efforts at manufacturing consent put in place under Jiang Zemin and, especially, Hu
Jintao. On the international scene, Xi has also reinforced the Party’s historic tendency to see
its interlocutors through the dichotomous division between “friends” (those who support
the Party’s interests) and “enemies” (those who are the least bit critical).3 Additionally, he
went on with an accelerated militarization of the country and adopted a more aggressive
posture.4 Finally, since the adoption of the 2017 national intelligence law, both citizens and
Chinese public companies have been required to cooperate with Chinese intelligence ser1. Revisionism because the CCP aims at reconfiguring the international system according to its own norms, values,
and institutions (→ p. 148).

vices. This obligation further blurs the line between public and private spaces in the life of
overseas citizens and companies. Any citizen or company can be forced to become a CCP
agent, in other words at the very least an informer and sometimes a spy.
Since 2017, approximately, we have witnessed a third phase that has accelerated
with the 2019 Hong Kong crisis and the 2020 pandemic. Andrew Small and Shruva
Jaishankar list four possible theories to explain this last transformation:5 (1) the opportunistic assertiveness theory (Beijing takes advantage of political and economic problems in
the rest of the world, and in the West in particular, to advance its interests – in this respect
Beijing is convinced that democracies will inevitably decay, that this process has already
begun and accelerated with the pandemic: the Party-State is thus encouraged to seize this
opportune moment [kairos]) – this is also the thesis brilliantly supported by Rush Doshi6:
China would face a period of strategic opportunity revealed by the internal difficulties
of the West (Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, or the West’s inability to manage the
health crisis in particular); (2) the imperious assertiveness or hybris theory (“China’s leaders
have internalized their own success to an inordinate degree. They genuinely believe that
China now offers a viable alternative to the United States as a global power and that any
criticism is unjustified or hypocritical.”7 Rivalry is accepted and taken on. This excessive
confidence is at once unfounded, as China has numerous weaknesses, and dangerous, as it
could further encourage an aggressive posture); (3) the “reactive assertiveness”8 theory (the
Chinese behavior is here explained as an “escalatory response to the immediate economic,
reputational, security, and political challenges China faces through the pandemic and its
aftermath”9); and (4) the insecure assertiveness theory (the Chinese behavior would then
be explained by the leadership’s fear that China is entering “an extended period of vulnerability:” Beijing’s actions thus reveal not “a sense of strength, but of weakness.”10) These
theories are not mutually exclusive, and a combination of explanations is possible and even
probable. This is why Peter Martin is right to speak of the “mixture of self-declared confidence and jumpy insecurity manifested by the current leadership” of the Party-State.11
Whatever the right explanation(s) may be, Beijing has demonstrated a growing
aggressiveness in recent years, first in its regional environment (Hong Kong, Taiwan,
India, Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and to a lesser extent Malaysia and Japan), but
also in the rest of the world (North America and Europe first and foremost). This behavior,
which breaks with the “non-intervention” tradition of the Chinese foreign policy, is sometimes called “sharp power.” While “soft power” is “the ability to affect others by attraction and persuasion,” according to Joseph Nye’s definition,12 “sharp power” is the use of
“subversion, bullying, and pressure, which combine to promote self-censorship.”13
The term is not new but was popularized by a report from the National Endowment for
Democracy (NED) which, in December 2017, applied it to the Chinese and Russian postures. “Sharp power,” as explained by its authors, does not seek to attract (unlike soft power)

but to “pierce, penetrate, or perforate the information and political environments in the targeted countries.”14 The term is fashionable but debatable (is sharp power ultimately nothing
more than “a type of hard power,” as Joseph Nye believes?).15 Like J. Michael Cole therefore, we prefer to speak of “political warfare” or “influence operations.”16
The goal of these operations is, on one hand, to prevent any negative discussion of
the CCP, by anticipating and controlling all the narratives on the “five poisons” (Uyghurs,
Tibetans, Falun Gong, “pro-democracy activists,” “Taiwanese separatists”) and any criticism of the Party generally; on the other hand, they mean to generate a positive narrative about the prosperity, strength, and peaceful rise of China. This is directed at several
targets: first at overseas Chinese citizens (students, researchers, businessmen, etc.) who
will return home or travel back and forth, thus potentially importing corrupting (democratic and liberal) ideas into China; then, at those presented as forming a Chinese overseas
“community,” “sons and daughters of China,” who are foreigners of Chinese ancestry in
the broadest sense, whatever their current citizenship or the number of generations since
their closest ancestor born in China (ethno-nationalism); finally, at the rest of the world, i.e.
national public opinions, primarily in the countries that matter for Beijing, and for various
reasons. In any case, outward influence has first and foremost domestic motivations: the
CCP’s top priority is to stay in power and perpetuate the regime. But this cannot ipso facto
mean that China does not, at the same time, have global ambitions or a grand strategy, as a
careful study of the Party’s output reveals (→ p. 148).17
The question of Chinese influence, in the world in general or in a country in particular, has
in recent years sparked an exponential number of publications, an overview of which can
be found in the more than 3,000 footnotes in the present volume. The “literature” on Chinese
influence covers the whole spectrum of publications, from scientific articles and press articles
to books and (numerous) reports from think tanks and research centers of which several, like
the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in Canberra, have developed a real expertise
and a regular production on the subject in recent years.18 Despite this extraordinary abundance, the greater part of which is written in English and focuses on several cases – such as
Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States and Canada – our knowledge of these
complex operations, carried out by an intricate web of actors, remains fragmented.
Like Antoine Bondaz, we feel that “a better understanding of the mechanisms of the Chinese
influence abroad, and more specifically in Europe and France, is crucial.”19
In analyzing these activities, the line between influence (which is legitimate) and
interference (which is illegitimate) is thin and blurred. “As with many things involving
China, there is a continuum, running from what is acceptable to not acceptable,” noted
David Mulroney, former Canadian ambassador to China.20 Thus, drawing red lines has been

one of the major issues for states. Following former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm
Turnbull, a red line could be drawn by “foreign influence activities that are in any way
covert, coercive or corrupt.”21 This then includes deceptive conducts and activities that corrupt “political processes, media markets, public debate and academic freedom, for example,
by using improper inducements falling short of criminal bribery.”22 Because any attempt at
a definition is inevitably open to criticisms, a more pragmatic way to understand where the
line between acceptable influence and unacceptable interference lies is, as Charles Parton
suggested, approaching it in terms of its reciprocity: would similar actions be tolerated by
the CCP in China?23 Obviously, the comparison has its limits, as a liberal democracy does
not behave the way an authoritarian regime does. Ultimately, it is up to each country to draw
the boundaries of acceptable behavior according to its interests and values.
Be that as it may, this report covers the entire influence spectrum, from benign influence (public diplomacy) to malign influence, that is, interference (“clandestine, coercive,
and corrupt” activities”24). Preparing this report, we conducted numerous interviews during
travels to Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan (November 2018), Kenya (January 2019), Japan (March
2019), Vietnam (April 2019), Canada and the United States (April-May 2019), Singapore (April,
August, and November 2019), Taiwan (April 2019 and January 2020), South Korea (April and
June 2019), Mongolia (June 2019), Australia (August 2019), the Czech Republic (November
2019), Denmark (January-February 2020), Sweden (February 2020), Germany (March 2020)
and the United Kingdom (March 2020). We also drew from the available scientific literature
in several languages and used open source intelligence (OSINT) resources.
This report proceeds in four parts: concepts, actors, actions, and case studies.
Without of course claiming to be exhaustive, particularly for the actions and cases presented
here (they ultimately only illustrate what Beijing is capable of), this report aims nevertheless to lay out a relatively comprehensive overview of Chinese influence operations
across the globe – avoiding as much as possible the problem of biting off more than one
can chew. It thus goes in-depth on certain subjects, and a few investigations, notably those
on the Base 311 (→ p. 89), the LJC’s influence operations (→ p. 74), the ecosystem of
think tanks and publishers relaying the Party’s influence in France (→ p. 314), and on Larry
Romanoff (→ p. 603), are, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive, in any language.
The reader might be surprised not to find in this volume a chapter dedicated to France,
since the authors are French and the fourth part contains case studies on Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Sweden and Canada. France is not absent from the following pages, which
contain many French examples, but we did not want to gather them in a separate chapter
for several reasons. First, because we have tried, as far as possible, to adopt a “view from
nowhere”25: we did not conceive this work as a French report aimed at a French audience,
and therefore focused on the French case, but as a study of Chinese influence operations – its
concepts, its actors, its operating modes – throughout the world. Secondly, because it seems to
us that France has not been a priority target of Chinese influence until now, at least compared
to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom or even
Sweden, which are cases with certain specificities. Finally, because, for a long time, France

was seen as a “soft” target, on which it was sufficient to exert economic pressure to obtain
the desire effects. It was therefore not necessary to mount clandestine and complex influence
operations. For some years now, however, France has been putting up resistance: this is the
“French awakening” described in the conclusion (→ p. 640). As the environment becomes
less permissive for Beijing, one can therefore expect its operations to become more aggressive
in the future. Hence the usefulness of this report in the French context.
That said, our approach is descriptive, not normative: the goal of this report is to
describe, understand, and analyze Chinese influence operations as precisely as possible. Of
course, there is, implicitly, a normative dimension, in the sense that this description contributes to a growing understanding of the risks these practices pose to civil liberties, human
rights, and national sovereignty worldwide.26 That being said, we do not address “what
should be done”: this report contains no recommendations. It is left to others to draw
the necessary political consequences, which are evidently not the same for everyone.

26. Normativity is everywhere because all approaches have “a point of view, a perspective, even when they do not
recognize it.” The question is to know to what extent it is assumed (Jean-Baptiste Jeangène Vilmer, Théories des relations
internationales (Theories of International Relations), Que sais-je ?, 2020, 15-16).

Resorting to influence operations is not new for the Chinese regime; scholars have highlighted the existence of a particularly active policy of internal and external propaganda
since the formation of red bases at the end of the 1920s.1 Chinese influence operations
are partly inspired by the Soviet experience, and they draw on two major doctrinal
sources: first, the United Front (统一战线), which originated with the Party itself and
feeds now its entire machinery of power; and then, the “Three Warfares” doctrine (三
种战法), more recent and more restrictively used. The doctrine was devised by the People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) but it has been used well beyond the military realm. Here, the
PLA takes on its traditional role as the Party’s influence multiplier, for instance. Beyond
these frameworks, the actors of Chinese influence operations have created numerous concepts tied to their influence strategies, and the most important of them are succinctly laid
out in this first part. After briefly introducing the relevant concepts (United Front, Three
Warfares, cognitive operations, discursive power, political warfare and active measures),
we elaborate on the two principal theoretical sources of Chinese influence operations, the
United Front and the Three Warfares.
The reader may be surprised not to find in the following pages familiar references that
are commonly used to describe the Chinese strategy. If Chinese theorists sometimes call
on classic authors, Sun Zi above all, they do so essentially to give credibility and a historical
foundation to their work. But their debt to this heritage should be nuanced. This report
also does not make use of the famous book by the Chinese generals Qiao Liang and Wang
Xiangsui, Unrestricted Warfare (1999),2 which is unrepresentative despite being frequently
highlighted as an indispensable reference to understanding contemporary Chinese strategic
thinking. As Peter Mattis noted, “[one] of the first clues about whether someone is a credible analyst of the PLA comes from their preferred source for Chinese military thinking
and strategy. An analysis that places Unrestricted Warfare above (or perhaps does not even
reference) The Science of Military Strategy (the reference manual at the Academy of Military
Science)3 offers little insight into how the Chinese military came to develop a strategy to
wage war and protect China’s national interests.”4
Likewise, the concept of the “information warfare” or “informational warfare,” central
to other strategic traditions, including in the United States (information warfare) and Russia
(информационная война), are not used as such in this report since it takes broader conno1. Timothy Cheek, Propaganda and Culture in Mao’s China (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997); Anne-Marie Brady,

tations in the Chinese context. Indeed, the field of informational warfare (信息战) includes
not only psychological warfare (→ p. 49) and political warfare (→ p. 33), but also, and
above all, electronic warfare, which undoubtedly constitutes its essential component. As
the authors of The Science of Military Strategy maintained, informational warfare aims first at
“carrying out electronic attacks on networks, high-intensity informational attacks, jamming
and damaging the adversary’s operating systems to render it incapable of seeing and hearing
clearly and unable to log in, all in order to create the conditions for future strikes.”5 In this
report, we instead adopted the notion of “information manipulation” (→ p. 362), at once
narrower since limited to informational operations strictly speaking (excluding electronic
warfare and cyber operations), and more extensive since not limited to actions put in place
by the PLA.

THE VOCABULARY
OF CHINESE INFLUENCE

I. The United Front
The term United Front commonly refers, first, to the alliance forged by the communists
and the nationalists when they fought their common Japanese enemy during the Second
World War. But the United Front is in fact limited neither to this coalition nor to those
subsequently formed with non-communist forces to overthrow the government and bring
about the revolution. In fact, the United Front has endured from the revolution to this day,
and it now entails above all “mobilizing the Party’s friends to strike its enemies.”1
In other words, it is a matter of shaping the forces outside of the Party to ensure its
durability. Originally formulated by Lenin in his essay “Left-Wing” Communism: An Infantile
Disorder (1920), in which he criticized the communists who refused to take advantage of
the platform offered by the democratic life in parliamentary regimes in the name of ideological purity, the United Front is one of the “three magic weapons” (法 宝) theorized by
Mao Zedong in 19382 – the other two being armed struggles and the construction of the
Party. These strategies are not the sole responsibility of the United Front Work Department
(UFWD) but are deployed throughout the entire Party apparatus, as all its arms are tasked
with implementing this policy (→ p. 35).

II. The “Three Warfares”
The “Three Warfares” doctrine was formulated in 2003. It encompasses psychological
warfare (心理战), public opinion warfare (舆论战), and legal warfare (法律战). These
three dimensions – which respectively aim at influencing the adversary’s decisions, shaping
its public opinion, and forging a normative environment favorable to China – should not
be understood as a Chinese version of the “hybrid warfare,” but as an extension of the
actions of the Party. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which is the armed wing of
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) more than a national army, is primarily tasked with
ensuring the longevity of the regime by augmenting the CCP’s political power. The “Three
Warfares” should be interpreted within this framework (→ p. 45).

A. Public opinion warfare
An article published in 2004 in the PLA Daily, the PLA’s English newspaper, defined
public opinion warfare (→ p. 48) as “the integrated use of newspapers, radios, televisions,
the Internet, and other news media” in a “planned and targeted manner to encourage the
drive to fight in its own camp and to make the will to fight in the enemy’s collapse, driving the international public opinion at the same time.”3 In 2011, the Chinese Dictionary of
Military Terminology explained that the notion consists in “creating a public opinion environment favorable to political initiative and military victory (through) the use of diverse
media and informational resources to combat the enemy.”4 The Chinese generally translate
“public opinion warfare” (舆论 战) as the “war of consensus.”
The PLA also takes a great interest in methods shaping online public opinion. Two
different terms are used to refer to the general idea of public opinion, 舆情 (yuqing)
and 舆论 (yulun), which we have translated as “public emotion” and “public opinion”
respectively. According to Li Changzu (李昌祖), of the Department of Propaganda at
Zhejiang University of Technology, and to his colleague Xu Tianlei (许 天雷),5 the first
term refers to the subjective interpretation of certain social realities while the second
stresses the socio-political attitudes generated by social interactions. Public emotion can
thus be individual whereas public opinion is the collective majority opinion; public emotion can be implicit in nature while public opinion is explicit; similarly, a public emotion
does not necessarily become the public opinion and the latter is not always based on
public emotion; finally, control over public feelings is an important part of the work to
orientate public opinion. In this context, the PLA is interested in tactics that allow
the manipulation of opinions and emotions.

B. Psychological warfare
According to the 2011 Dictionary of Military Terminology, psychological warfare (→ p. 49)
consists above all in “using specific information and media [for] combat actions that
affect the psychology and behavior of the target audience.”6 It comprises several
aspects including dissuasion (“to encourage a potential adversary to be cautious about
joining a war or, ideally, to be opposed to fighting in a particular war”) and deception (“to
develop false information to ‘draw the enemy’s attention’ and thereby adversely impact his
decision-making”).7

C. Legal warfare
The Chinese legal warfare (→ p. 51), which echoes Western debates on lawfare,8 refers
to a strategic use of the law. It is one of the tools of a non-kinetic war that offers influence over an actor’s behavior to strategic ends. As with the two other components of the
“Three Warfares,” successful legal warfare limits the others’ freedom of action while
it increases that of China. It provides a basis to entrench the legitimacy of Chinese
demands. As such, it is less a legal “war” than a rhetorical confrontation. The goal is to
show that the law is on one’s side, whatever the (international or national) law may actually state – even if this means instrumentalizing courts for political ends. The military is
indeed encouraged to identify and exploit the legal provisions favoring Chinese interests as
much as possible, to ignore those that run counter to them, and hence to support a favorable interpretation of international law, even if it differs from the accepted interpretation.9

III. “Cognitive domain operations”
Combat in the cognitive domain (认知领域作战) is one of the concepts recently developed by the PLA. The goal of these operations is to constitute “a power to control the
mind” (制脑权) or, in other words “using psychological warfare to shape or even control
the enemy’s cognitive thinking and decision-making.”10 These concepts (cognitive
domain operations and mind-control power) appeared in 2012,11 and the second was theorized in a book published in January 2014,12 co-authored by Professor Zeng Huafeng (曾华
锋), the dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the National University
of Defense Technology (国防科技大学). Zeng defined mind control power as “using
spiritual/psychological information disseminated by propaganda outlets, national language,
cultural products, etc., as a tool to infiltrate, influence and even steer the nation’s public and
its elites’ knowledge, emotion, and consciousness. The goal is to manipulate a country’s
values, national spirit/ethos, ideologies, cultural traditions, historical beliefs, etc.
to encourage them to abandon their theoretical understanding, social system, and
development path and hence to achieve strategic objectives without fighting.”13 Activities
in these areas are closely tied to the progress made in artificial intelligence.

instance: Charles J. Dunlap, “Law and Military Interventions: Preserving Humanitarian Values in 21st Conflicts”

School of Government, Harvard University, 2001); Orde F. Kittrie, Lawfare: Law as a Weapon of War (Oxford: Oxford

IV. Discursive power
The notion of discursive power (话语权) appeared in China at the end of the 2000s.14
It was meant to replace the notion of soft power (软实力) which had generated sustained
debates following the translation of Joseph Nye’s work at the beginning of the 2000s.
The emergence of this discursive ambition for the Party in fact reflects the failure – or
at least the shortfalls – of the policy of building a Chinese soft power. This failure
was attributed not to the Party’s miscalculations but to the discursive domination
of the great Western powers. Zhang Zhizhou (张志洲), in an article published on the
website of the Chinese government’s Information Office,15 evoked the influence of the
ideas of Michel Foucault in the emergence of the concept. Foucault is one of the bestknown French philosophers in China, even if the understanding of his thinking remains
often “superficial and mundane.”16 The notion of discursive power developed by Chinese
intellectuals and the Party seems in this way to draw its inspiration from Michel Foucault’s
inaugural lecture at the Collège de France entitled L’Ordre du discours (The Order of Discourse).
In it, Foucault notably defended the idea that access to the discursive space is always conditioned and that “speech does not simply translate the struggles and systems of
domination, but that it is what for which, by which we struggle – the power that we
seek to seize.”17 To seize a voice is to seize power, and to seize power is to exclude the
others’ voice. This is how the Party represents itself on the international stage: incapable of
asserting its interests for lack of a sufficiently audible voice.
In this context, the Party hopes to develop its capacity to influence the formulation
of norms, the construction of values, governance structures, and so on. In other
words, for want of an ability to seduce the world, the Party seeks to dominate it by
imposing its voice and its narratives. The notion of discursive power, omnipresent in
the diplomatic and cultural fields, has also been used in the military domain. For the PLA,
discursive power is based on the ability to shape information, beliefs, and minds (信息—
信仰—心智) in peacetime as well as in wartime, which includes times of emergencies.18
Considerations on the discursive power in the military realm are thus partly linked to the
“Three Warfares” doctrine.19

V. Political warfare
In their publication on the PLA-led political warfare (政治战), Mark Stokes and Russel
Hsiao defined the concept more precisely as fall the methods used to influence emotions,
motivations, objective reasoning, and the behavior of the governments, organizations,
groups, and individuals of a target country in a way that is favorable to the acting country’s
own political and military goals.20 This echoes the definition given by George Kennan in
his famous 1948 telegram: broadly speaking, to “the employment of all the means at a
nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives”.21

VI. Active measures
Although the notion of “active measures” comes not from China but from the Soviet
Union, it is useful and it adequately complements the previous concepts in order to understand the repertoire of actions of the Chinese actors.
Active measures (aктивные Мероприятия) are “the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence,”
in the words of the former KGB general Oleg Kalugin.22 They were defined by Vasili
Mitrokhin, a former senior KGB archivist, as “operational measures aimed at exerting useful influence on aspects of the political life of a target country which are of interest, its foreign policy, the solution of international problems, misleading the adversary, undermining
and weakening his positions, the disruption of his hostile plans, and the achievement of
other aims.”23 The Dictionary of Counterintelligence used by the Higher School of the KGB and
published in 1972 referenced “acts of counterintelligence making it possible to penetrate
the intentions of the enemy, allowing his unwanted steps to be anticipated, to lead
the enemy into error, to take the initiative from him, to thwart his actions of sabotage.”24 In the Soviet terminology, active measures were influence operations manufactured
and carried out by the KGB and in particular by Service A of the First Chief Directorate
(forbearer of the SVR).25 They were carried out abroad to create a favorable environment
for the USSR. For that reason, the classification of these operations as counterintelligence
may have been surprising but active measures were not conflated with defensive measures:
rather, they were operations that fell in the oxymoronic category of offensive defensive
measures. Active measures were largely incorporated within the USSR’s foreign policy
apparatus where they constituted a mode of action seen as both regular and legitimate,26
unlike in the United States and other Western countries where clandestine actions were
perceived as falling outside of ordinary law and were incidentally thought of as exceptions.

Active measures constituted a vast – and variable, according to the authors – repertoire
of influence tools in the Party’s hands. Among them, we found disinformation, counterfeit, sabotage, discredit operations against people or organizations, the destabilization of foreign governments (via the organization of protests for instance), provocation,
false-flag operations and manipulations aimed at weakening the social cohesion
of the target, the recruitment of “useful idiots” often employed to spread narratives
created by the KGB and the creation of façade structures (front organizations), officially independent but that operated to the KGB and USSR’s advantage. Some experts also
included assassinations and terrorist actions.27 Whatever the means, the goal was always
to influence the policies pursued by a foreign actor.
Certain scholars and experts have revisited the notion of active measures since the conflict in Ukraine to describe influence operations carried out by Russian intelligence agencies
(GRU, SVR, FSB) in the post-Soviet era. The notion is rarely used in the Chinese case however, but Chinese actors seem to have drawn from the repertoire of tools created by the
KGB to carry out their influence operations, as we will see with the case of the operation
we named “Infektion 2.0.,” which framed the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic as American
(→ p. 589). More generally, it will be featured in our conclusion on the “Russification” of
Chinese strategies (→ p. 620).

Chapter 2

THE UNITED FRONT:
THE PARTY’S “MAGIC WEAPON”

The notion of the United Front remains insufficiently understood despite being an
invaluable key to understanding the Communist Party’s influence operations. The first difficulty undoubtedly comes from the confusion that arises from the ambiguous nature of
the expression “United Front.” In the words of Emmanuel Jourda, whose doctoral thesis
constitutes the most complete work on the subject, the United Front designated a triple
“dispositive of thoughts on society, the organization of the CCP, and the political action.”1 In turn, Alex Joske differentiated between “[the] United Front (统一战
线), a coalition of groups and individuals working toward the CCP’s goals; the work of
the United Front (统一战线工作) which refers to the CCP’s efforts to strengthen and
expand the United Front by influencing and co-opting targets; the United Front Work
Department (中央统一战线工作部), a CCP Central Committee department that coordinates and carries out the United Front’s actions; and the United Front system (统一战
线系统 or 统一战线工作系统), which brings together the agencies, social organizations,
businesses, universities, research institutes and individuals carrying out the United Front’s
activities.”2 At once a dedicated body within the Chinese Party-State apparatus and a
galaxy of actors orbiting around it, the United Front is not easily understood.
A further difficulty comes from its broad spectrum, whose depth is often underestimated, ranging from “open” operations – i.e. public diplomacy undertaken by ambassadors across the world – to clandestine operations aiming to “undermine social cohesion,
exacerbate racial tension, influence politics, harm media integrity, facilitate espionage, and
increase unsupervised technology transfer.”3 While the UFWD is not an intelligence service per se, it can nevertheless offer a cover for intelligence officers carrying out clandestine
actions and “recruiting” Taiwanese agents.4 Finally, understanding the United Front implies
highlighting the historical trajectory of this central CCP concept.
After a brief overview of the key moments in the construction of the concept of the
United Front, we mention the objectives and infrastructures on which its operations rely.
Ultimately, we offer a typology of United Front operations.

I. Concept of Leninist origin
The concept of the United Front in China comes from a graft operated by the Comintern
at the beginning of the 1920s. The concept finds its roots in the Communist Manifesto (1848)
in which Marx and Engels considered possible temporary alliances between communists
and democratic parties to accelerate the course of history and to take power. Lenin, however, is considered “the true father of the United Front.”5 In his criticism of Left-Wing
Communism: An Infantile Disorder (1920), he hammered home that to achieve the victory
of communism, it was sometimes necessary to accept certain compromises, to seize the
“slightest possibility of ensuring a numerically strong ally, be it a temporary ally, faltering,
conditional, fragile or insecure.”6 For Lenin, the United Front was a tactical collaboration,
considered as an intermediatory step before the victory of communism. The Comintern
then promoted the use of the concept of temporary alignment, allowing the reconciliation
of short-term demands and long-term objectives, in Europe as well as in Asia. The United
Front is thus not a proper Chinese concept.
In China, it was initially tied to the anti-Japanese alliance with the Kuomintang between
1924 and 1927, and then from 1937 to 1945. The term used in Chinese was first Lianhe
Zhanxian (聯合戰線), before being replaced by Tongyi Zhanxian (統一戰線).7 In the late
1930s, the Party took ownership of the Leninist concept, modified its theoretical framework and used it as a vector of its drive to take power. From 1938 on, Mao maintained
that the United Front, the building of the Party’s and the armed struggle were the
“magic weapons”8 (法宝) that would allow the communists to triumph, an expression
that was picked up by several of his successors (up until Xi Jinping) to benefit from his
symbolic aura.
When the People’s Republic of China was declared on October 1, 1949, the United
Front became the tool to rally the majority around the party. The first United Front
national labor conference was held from March to April 1950. And the normative recognition of the United Front landed in 1954, with its integration in the preamble of the
Constitution. It now states that the “popular democratic United Front” makes itself useful
in mobilizing and rallying “the entire population in the common struggle to achieve the
fundamental role of the State during the transition,” but also to “confront internal and
external enemies.”9 The CCP put in place a strategy found more or less everywhere across
the communist world: communist parties collaborate with what Robert Havemann called
the “empty acronyms,”10 namely parties without real positions and literally domesticated by
the communist parties. This tactic was particularly developed after the Comintern’s Seventh
Congress in 1935 which set building national fronts as a global strategy.11 Mao’s theory of
a new democracy is thus the Chinese implementation of this United Front policy. Once
the regime was established, the United Front’s role was no longer to take power but to
perpetuate the CCP’s control. To do so, the United Front became at once the intellectual,

political, and organic framework to rally needed allies to the CCP while it silenced
those it couldn’t persuade.
After the disappearance of the United Front during the Cultural Revolution, the institution
was once again identified as a “magic weapon” in 1983. It was reemployed by the Party for
its flexibility, its ability to forge ties (in other words, for its “primary function as a cohesive
force”12), but also to fight against international criticisms following the Tian’anmen events.13
The 18th United Front Work National Conference in 1993 marked the return of the Chinese
People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) as the body supervising the United Front.
Created in 1949, it was considered the “United Front structure of the whole Chinese democratic people”14 before the United Front Work Department gained the upper hand. Bringing
together representatives of minority parties and other religious or independent ethnic groups,
it has become the symbol of a semblance of political plurality and representativeness. Finally,
the United Front accompanies the country’s growing international footprint in striving to
strengthen links with the Chinese diaspora and to silence opposition to the CCP abroad.

II. Revival and diversification of the United Front under Xi
Jinping
Since coming to power in 2012, Xi Jinping has reinvigorated the United Front,
with which he was already very familiar: his father had contributed to its activities in
Tibet and Xi wrote an article about its work in the diaspora in 1995, while he was the Party
secretary in the city of Fuzhou. The new CCP Secretary worked to reform the United Front
after having purged the director of the UFWD, Ling Jihua (令计划) in December 2014,
because he had been a close ally to former secretary Hu Jintao (胡锦涛). His goal was to
correct what he saw as the shortcomings of the United Front and put it once again at the
heart of Party’s action. Xi pointed out that the United Front was not sufficiently united, and
insisted that its work should be carried out by all Party members.15
In May 2015, the United Front Work National Labor Conference was raised to the
rank of central conference, thereby acknowledging its increased importance. The same
year, a steering group of the Central Committee for United Front activities was established,
and the first provisional ruling on United Front activities published.16 The United Front
Work Department saw its number of offices increase to account for the new targets
(→ p. 68). The goal of the reforms was to ensure a better coordination of the activities
of the United Front and to reinforce the Party’s control on the structures. It also enlarged
its perimeter of activities to include the protection of the Party: in his report to the 19th

Congress, Xi Jinping spoke of drawing, with the United Front, the widest possible
concentric circle around the Party.17
From a rhetorical point of view, the reference to a “magic weapon” was reactivated. Xi
Jinping also brought the expression “Great United Front” (大统战) back into fashion, which
had initially been promoted by a theoretician from the Central Institute of Socialism in 1993.
Its meaning seems, however, to have evolved. According to another theoretician from the
Institute, this is the most distinctive characteristic of United Front thinking in the Xi Jinping
era:18 it insists more than ever on the strategic importance of the United Front and on the
necessity to improve its coordination.19 For Gerry Groot, the new “Great United Front” is no
longer limited to representing and creating links between different social groups in order to
exert control over them, but it is a method that can go as far as forcing the assimilation
into the dominant Han culture, using methods such as mass internment.20
The United Front is therefore a Communist Party policy devised to develop and
reinforce its hegemony. The activities of the United Front consist in allying with or
neutralizing groups situated outside the sphere of CCP control to ensure its role as the
sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people. Concretely, this means eliminating
domestic and external enemies, controlling groups that could defy CCP authority,
building a coalition around the Party in order to serve its interests, and projecting
its influence abroad in such a way that even individuals and groups based in liberal
societies are brought to censor themselves and avoid taking a position against the
CCP.21 The United Front accordingly takes on a considerable part in the influence operations carried out by the Party.

The United Front is a policy that essentially “uses the friends of the Party to fight its
enemies.” It should be thought of as a strategy deployed in concentric circles and
whose ambition is to bring together the largest possible population. This is therefore
not a Chinese policy but rather a policy of the Party, employed in China as well as overseas.
Wherever the Party is threatened, the United Front system is active.
The Party distinguishes twelve primary targets, which correspond to the twelve offices
of the UFWD (→ p. 68): the members of eight minority parties (known as the eight democratic parties); individuals without a party affiliation, intellectuals not linked to the Party, ethnic minorities; religious individuals; private companies; urban professionals; students studying
or returning from studies abroad; residents of Hong Kong and Macao; the Taiwanese and

their relatives in mainland China; individuals of Chinese ancestry throughout the world (diasporas) and their relatives in mainland China; and all the other individuals requiring “unity and
connection.”22 This list illustrates the continuity between domestic spaces and the rest
of the world: the only meaningful distinction for a United Front that operates everywhere, inside and outside of the country, is between the Party and the rest. The goal is
to control this dozen priority targets, to prevent them from doing harm on the one hand and,
on the other, to incite or force them to act as representatives of the Party.
In this respect, the goals of the United Front should also be understood in light of the
2015 National Security Law (中华人民共和国国家安全法).23 As Peter Mattis rightly noted,24 Article 2 of the law defines security as the absence of domestic or external threat
(没有危险和不受内外威胁的状态), which legitimates preventative actions to reduce any
threat. The law furthermore adopts a particularly extensive definition of national security
– much broader than the 1993 version of the law which mostly focused on protection
against espionage. This law also includes culture since the Party fears “cultural infiltration” (文化渗透),25 in other words the penetration into China of Western values that are
deemed subversive (rule of law, democracy, liberalism), but also ideas that could weakened
the CCP’s legitimacy and monopoly. It is therefore fundamental for the Party to control
the realm of ideas and, consequently, the narratives that construct China’s image abroad
and which shape the environment in which it evolves. In this interpretative framework, it
is understood that the diaspora constitutes a priority target for the Party; Chinese of
the diasporas, via their command of local cultural codes, are indeed the most likely
to import democratic values into China and thereby to threaten the Party.26 Control
over these diasporas, and by extension the elimination of all cultural threats, makes the
United Front’s missions an absolute priority for the Party. To this end, United Front activities are coordinated by the UFWD but can be carried out by a broad spectrum of actors in
the Party, a nexus that can be referred to as the “United Front system.”

IV. The infrastructure: A “United Front system”
Actors implementing the work of the United Front can be found wherever the Party
exists – from the Central Committee to provincial and municipal offices, youth leagues to
unions, diplomats posted overseas to branches of the Xinhua press agency, but also inside
the large state-owned companies and numerous universities and research centers.
The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is the highest
supervisory and coordinating body of the United Front system. The UFWD is required to
follow its directives. Then, numerous organizations are directly subordinate to, or maintain
close ties with, the UFWD. It is not easy to draw up an exhaustive list as these ramifications
can be sprawling – and they have been since the creation of the regime: a 1957 CIA report,
declassified in 1999, presented an instructive list that revealed the United Front’s capacity

found in all sectors, and first of all in:28
• The Media:
The China News Service (中国新闻社), the party’s main press agency, which has dozens

the Global Chinese Language Media; the journals China Religion (中国宗教), China Tibet
(中国西藏), and so on.

The Western Returned Scholars Association
The Western Returned Scholars Association (WRSA), founded in 1913 by Chinese reformist intellectuals, and which name literally means the association of students in Europe
and America (欧美同学会)29 currently brings together 40,000 Chinese students and scholars
and it has branches in 15 countries including in France (its headquarters are in Marseille). Its
secretary general is a UFWD executive. It is used, for instance, to develop relationships with
foreign think tanks and to contribute to recruiting foreign researchers for Chinese research
centers and companies via the “Thousand Talents” program put in place in 2008 (→ p. 292).
The WRSA also created the Center for China and Globalization (CCG), a self-described
“non-governmental” think tank based in Beijing, and whose president, Wang Huiyao (王辉
耀), also a member of several United Front groups, is a UFWD advisor and one of the thinking heads behind the Chinese strategy of international recruitment.30 According to Intelligence
Online, which cites a few names, “in order to expand its network, CCG has recruited as consultants former foreign officials from the political, economic and academic worlds.”31

University (暨南大学), based in Guangzhou, which is one of the oldest Chinese universities, one of the first to have welcomed foreign students and currently one of the
universities in China hosting the most of them; Huaqiao University (华侨大学), based
in Xiamen and Quanzhou, in Fujian – whose name literally means “Overseas Chinese
University”; the China Tibetan Language High Institute of Buddhism (中国藏语系高

Chinese universities host local UFWD branches that monitor students as well as
instructors, handle student informers and establish databases on everyone.32 The

Chinese Academy of Sciences also has an internal UFWD office that plays the same
role regarding the more than 60,000 researchers working for the institution. And, across
the world, the Chinese Students and Scholars Associations (CSSAs 中国学生学

coordination with the Ministry of Education in most universities: one of these CSSAs
incidentally admitted that the UFWD is actually responsible for the “general orientation

• Diasporic affairs:
Since March 2018, the diaspora falls under the direct responsibility of the UFWD,
whereas this responsibility was previously shared between the Office of Overseas
Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.34 The diaspora being an imaginary community, since it is in fact extremely diverse, United Front efforts consist in shaping,
controlling, and homogenizing its constituent groups. Also falling under the United
Front are the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中华全国归国华
侨联合会), the China Overseas Friendship Association (中华海外联谊会), Huangpu
Military Academy Alumni Association (黄埔军校 同学会统战), the All-China Taiwan
Compatriots Organization (中华全国台湾同胞联谊会), and the China Council for the
Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification (中国和平统一促进会), which manages
a network of branches worldwide (→ p. 124).35
• Economy:
Several organizations contribute to the work of the United Front, including the Huaxing
Economic Advisory Service Center (华兴经济咨询服务中心), which provides economic consulting services, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (
中华全国工商业联 合会).36 The large state-owned companies generally have an
internal United Front section, such as the world’s leading steel manufacturer, China
Baowu Steel Group, the former CEO of which (2007-2016) became vice-Minister of
the UFWD. Chinese and foreign private companies are also increasingly a target.
Deloitte China, for example, has had an internal United Front association since 2016,
run by the CEO himself.37

The cultural sector is also the object of major United Front operations. The Chinese
Literature and Art Federation (中国文学艺术联合会),38 and the Confucius Institutes
(→ p. 299), are supervised by the United Front and represent powerful levers of mobilization, intelligence gathering, and informational warfare across the world.
The actors of the United Front system sometimes tend, when acting abroad, to enter
into partnerships with prestigious foreign institutions to “whitewash” their activities. This

is the approach taken, for example, by the China-United States Exchange Foundation
(CUSEF → p. 125) in the United States, which entered into agreements with, among others, Johns Hopkins University, the EastWest Institute, the Carnegie Endowment for Peace,
the Atlantic Council, and the Brookings Institution.39

V. Typology of United Front operations
The work of the United Front consists first of all in identifying and classifying the
targets and enemies of the Party. There exist, in particular, enemies of first or second
rank, those that cannot be fought and those with whom it is possible to form an alliance
before combatting them.40 This work is done via the recruitment of supporters for the
Communist regime, attempts to influence individuals who are prominent in their
respective fields or in their countries, controls exerted over groups challenging the
Party’s authority, intelligence gathering, and the elimination, or at least disruption,
of the Party’s enemies.41 The work of the United Front, inseparable from that of the
Party-State, is nevertheless “hardly perceptible in its details,” as “everything pertaining to
the activities of representative personalities is theoretically tied to the United Front.”42
Besides, its operations have the distinctive characteristic of being frequently conducted by
front organizations whose proximity to the United Front is not always obvious.43
The United Front has, in theory, total freedom to mobilize individuals and social groups
in favor of the CCP’s objectives and ambitions. We can nevertheless identify three principal
types of operations under which the other more or less fall.

A. Mobilizing the diasporas
Overseas executives and agents of the United Front are primarily tasked with working
with the Chinese diasporas in order to circulate the Party’s narratives and its interpretation
of global affairs, but also in order to mobilize them when necessary. The diasporas are thus
instrumentalized to exert pressure on governments whose policies contradict the Party’s
interests. This can include protesting against visits by individuals like the Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong or the Dalai Lama, movements sympathetic to Hong Kong protestors, or
events on Tibet or Xinjiang.44 Diasporas can also be “positively” mobilized to support the
visit of a Chinese official in their host country.

B. Controlling the narratives about China
The United Front also aims to ensure that, throughout the world and in all languages,
the way in which media, journalists, editorialists, researchers, instructors, etc. report on
China conforms to the Party’s interests, particularly on the most sensitive subjects, such
as the “five poisons” (Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong, pro-democracy activists, Taiwanese
separatists). This desire to control the narratives about China leads the Party to deploy
its charms toward key opinion-shapers (researchers, journalists, businessmen, politicians,
social media influencers). This strategy most often takes the form of leisure trips paid for
by the Party during which Chinese leaders pull out all the stops.

C. Building databases
The United Front also takes on the work of collecting data profiling the political or religious preferences of university students, politicians, public figures, and others. Whether vast
(one database is believed to contain information on 2.2 million Chinese scientists abroad)
or very precise (another targets Chinese doctoral students in the United States originating
from one particular town in China),45 the goal is the same: to provide the United Front with
the means to expand, thus to extend the Party’s influence. Public and private companies
play an important role in this collection of personal data (→ p. 129).

Chapter 3

THE “THREE WARFARES”

The “Three Warfares” strategy is one of the main doctrines of the People’s Liberation
Army (PLA) but, like the United Front, it remains relatively unknown, or at least insufficiently taken into consideration, despite the publication of several books and articles on the
subject.1 These “Three Warfares” – public opinion warfare, psychological warfare,
and legal warfare – represent most of the Chinese political warfare, understood as all
the forms of non-military confrontation that can be used to achieve a strategic objective.2
This three-front strategy of political warfare was officially adopted in 2003 by the Central
Committee of the CCP and the Central Military Commission (CMC) with the revised “PLA
Political Work Regulations.” It noted that wartime political work ought to include the implementation of public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal warfare.3 The 2010
revision added that all members of the military had to be trained in the “Three Warfares”
(Art. 14 §17); that military propaganda had to include public opinion warfare (Art. 14 §10);
that liaison work had to include psychological warfare (Art. 14 §14); and that political, legal
(Art. 14 §7) as well as judicial work (Art. 14 §9) had to include legal warfare.4
Political warfare is understood as a form of non-kinetic conflict. While it can take
diverse forms, the logic remains the same: political warfare is used to win without fighting (不战而胜) – or at least to achieve a broad victory with limited combats (小战大
胜) – so that enemy troops admit defeat without ever having fought (不战而屈人之兵).5
It is undertaken in wartime as well as peacetime (平战结合). The “Three Warfares”

are sometimes considered as a strategy of hybrid warfare to the extent that they blur the
boundaries between war and peace, between combatants and civilians, and between military and non-military means.6 Franck Hoffman’s definition echoes the “Three Warfares,”
referring to the coordinated use of different types of warfare jointly employed and creating
a synergistic effect between the physical and psychological dimensions of conflict.7 It is
important, however, not to confuse them, especially because the concept of “hybrid war”
itself is not precisely-defined.
With the development of information and communication technologies, and the speed
with which ideas can circulate worldwide, the “Three Warfares” are understood as a means
to develop a discursive power (话语权), in other words the ability to influence the perceptions of a target audience, control narratives and impose one’s own version of the facts.8
For that reason they are also portrayed as a confrontation in the cognitive domain (认
知领域的对抗).9 Their goal is to influence potentially destabilizing actors to deter them
from taking any action against China.10 The “Three Warfares” could also be understood as
a form of psychological warfare in the broadest sense. Others have underlined that this
strategy is comparable to the anti-access, area denial strategy (A2/AD), here applied
to the realm of ideas.11 These three types of offensive operations in peacetime pursue the
same goal, that of shaping an environment favorable to China (meaning to the Party)
and unfavorable to its enemies in order to limit their freedom of action and to meet the
regime’s objectives. Their mission is to allow the PLA to seize the decisive opportunity (先
机) and retain the initiative (主动). They are force multipliers.12
Last but not least, the “Three Warfares” must be understood as a strategy to strengthen
the Party’s political power, in the same way as the United Front. As the CCP’s armed
wing, the PLA’s principal mission is to guarantee the regime’s survival and augment the
CCP’s power. For Peter Mattis, the “Three Warfares” could even be understood as an
outgrowth of the United Front system and of the Party’s propaganda.13 As previously outlined, the United Front’s work consists in forming alliances with or neutralizing
the groups outside the reach of the CCP to impose the Party as the one and only legitimate
representative of the Chinese people. The “Three Warfares” need to be understood as part
and parcel of this policy and these efforts complement those of the United Front.
The conceptual origin of the notion is unclear. If its principles echo those of classical
Chinese military strategy, notably Sun Zi, according to whom “to win one hundred victories
in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the
acme of skill,”14 nothing proves that these ancient roots have had a decisive influence on

6. “Hybrid Warfare with Chinese Characteristics” is the title that Michael Raska chose for a short article describing
the “Three Warfares” strategy in RSIS Commentary, 262 (2015). There is no agreement on whether the “Three Warfares”
should be labelled hybrid warfare however. See, for example: Michael Clarke, “China’s Application of the ‘Three
Warfares’ in the South China Sea and Xinjiang,” Orbis (Jan. 2019), 192.

the development of the “Three Warfares.” A possible influence could however have been
the Introduction to Psychological Warfare published in 1990 by the National Defense University.15
There is also an American root to a certain extent. When the Central Committee and
the CMC adopted the “Three Warfares” strategy in 2003, it was not seen as a new strategy
conceived to get a head start over others, but as a necessary step to make up for China having fallen behind compared to other countries. From a Chinese perspective, the United
States is the champion of public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal
warfare. As they studied recent wars undertaken by Washington, from the 1991 Gulf War
which “made China aware of the considerable limits of its own capacities” in this domain,16
to the 2003 Iraq War (by way of the Balkans), Chinese analysts concluded that modern
warfare could be won thanks to non-military operations and non-kinetic capabilities.17 They
maintain that the United States was the first to employ propaganda and techniques manipulating public opinions, psychological attacks, and offensive legal maneuvers in a coordinated
manner to make their enemies fold.18
The insertion of the “Three Warfares” in the 2003 revision of the “PLA Political Work
Regulations” did not, however, mark the beginning of the use of these techniques by China;
it was an official endorsement instead, and an injunction for their coordinated implementation at all levels. The execution of the “Three Warfares” strategy was coordinated by
the Liaison Department of the former General Political Department (LD/GPD) which
used to oversee political warfare. Since the 2015 military reforms, the Liaison Department
of the new Political Work Department (LD/PWD) has probably inherited this mission.
Theoretically, all levels of the PLA are called to carry out the “Three Warfares,” but
at least one PLA base is specifically dedicated to this mission: Base 311, also known
as PLA Unit 61716 located in Fuzhou, in Fujian province, which faces Taiwan (→ p. 89).
The “Three Warfares” strategy addresses both external and internal threats, like
the Taiwanese independence movement, which is one of its principal targets. It applies to
members of the military but also to civilians, as the Party mobilizes all its branches along
with intermediaries to strengthen its power. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example,
plays a particular role in the diffusion of the Chinese discourse overseas via its network of
embassies – a role falling at once under the United Front and the “Three Warfares.”
The “Three Warfares” are considered as the three arms of the same body. They serve
the same strategic objective, are employed with the same logic, and are reinforcing each
other, each one paving the ground for the development of the other two. Public opinion
warfare offers a combat platform to psychological warfare and legal warfare. Legal warfare
provides the necessary legal bases for public opinion warfare and psychological warfare.
Finally, public opinion warfare and legal warfare both require psychological influence over
the public to be effective.19

I. Public opinion warfare
The goal of public opinion warfare is to win over target audiences – those of enemy
countries but also the international community – on the position defended by the government. The issue is not so much to know which armed forces will win, but which narrative, which version of the facts will prevail in a public opinion. Concretely, public opinion
warfare, as conceptualized by the Chinese, consists in carrying out the “cognitive orientation” (引导认知) of the masses, to “excite their emotions” (激发情感) and to
“constrain their behavior” (约束行为).20 This is an activity that can be carried at low
intensity as it is a continuous, permanent, and long-term endeavor: its goal is to surreptitiously shape the psyche.
All the media can be mobilized: the press, radio, television, social networks (Facebook,
YouTube, Twitter, WeChat, Weibo, TikTok, Plurk, etc.), films, and books. They are used to
impose a version of the facts as early as possible and to frame the debate – since the
first impression makes more of a mark than the subsequent ones, even if it is a mistaken
one (this is known as the anchoring bias in cognitive psychology). To carry out successful
public opinion warfare, one must be the first to react and to multiply sources defending this
version of the facts, while eventually (but not systematically) concealing the ties that might
lead back to the acting political source, in order to influence the perceptions and behavior
of target audiences. To impose their narrative, the protagonists of the Three Warfares
can also lean on the illusion-of-truth effect, a bias according to which the probability of
believing false information depends not on its logical nature but on an individual’s familiarity with the idea.21
By way of example, a video defending Chinese sovereignty in the South China Sea was
shown approximately 120 times per day on a 200-square-meter screen in Times Square in
New York City between July 23 and August 3, 2016.22 Earlier, on July 12, the Permanent
Court of Arbitration in The Hague had disavowed Beijing by indicating, among other
things, that China did not have historical rights over the South China Sea. The 3-minute
video subsequently broadcast suggested that the British MP Catherine West supported
the Chinese position, even though she had accepted the interview only to express her
support for a peaceful resolution of the tensions and did not expect the distorted use of
her remarks.23 The video’s authors selected several words from her statement and placed
them between those of three other individuals, whose remarks could not be clearer, and
with whom the MP thus seemed to agree: Wu Shicun, president of the National Institute
of South China Sea Studies; John Ross, introduced only as the former director of the
Department of Economic Policy for the Mayor of London, while he was also a columnist
for the website China.org, senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies

(31 Jul. 2016). Here are Catherine West’s remarks: “I think talks are crucial. And that’s why we have to be careful that
yes, we need to resolve something very locally, and have a grown-up approach to dialogue.” And here is how she
reacted after the video was published: “I was unaware that these comments would be used in this manner. Although I
was of course happy to give an interview on my concerns regarding the militarization of the South China Sea and the
need to work together to secure a peaceful resolution, I am not happy for the footage to be used in a way that suggests
that I support the current approach adopted by China toward these islands.”

audience.26 But, by diffusing its message repetitively in English in a public place frequented
by some 350,000 tourists from across the world daily, China targeted an international audience and stressed that it was ready to invest the money needed to shape opinions. The
maneuver’s effectiveness, however, was perplexingly limited given the concentration of billboards in Times Square27 and the message’s lack of subtlety.

II. Psychological Warfare
Psychological warfare is used to demoralize and dissuade enemy forces, making
them doubt, and even to terrorize them in order to undermine their ability and willingness to fight. It is used to break the bond of trust between those governing and those
governed and to disrupt the decision-making process of the enemy country. In other
words, it is used to defeat the enemy without a fight. Strictly speaking, psychological warfare is more frequently employed in wartime than peacetime, unlike public opinion warfare
which is constantly used whatever the level of tensions, and which targets a larger audience
than psychological warfare.
A work released by the PLA publishing house distinguished four types of psychological warfare: “coercion” (威慑), which seeks to force the other to adopt a certain behavior;
“mystification” (欺诈), which spreads confusion and misleads; “division” (离间), which
takes advantage of all potential weaknesses and disagreements within the enemy country
and paralyzes its decision-making process, breaks the motivation of the enemy’s fighters

and the people’s confidence; and finally, “defense” (防护), to safeguard the morale of
one’s own troops when they are the target of similar efforts by the enemy.28
The actions carried out by the Chinese communist regime against the Uyghur
ethnic minority in China (and overseas), is an example of psychological (but also physical) warfare, which would correspond to the coercive type presented above. Random arrests,
mass internment, forced labor, digital tracing, frequent inspections, forced Sinicization,
“reeducation” of children, destruction of places of worship, harassment, settlement of
nomads… the Uyghurs, a majority-Muslim Turkic ethnic group, are violently repressed
in the name of the fight against religious extremism.29 It is estimated that one to three
million Uyghurs are currently interned. Women are subjected to forced sterilization,30 but
also other “impos[ed] measures [intend] to prevent births within the group”31 – all acts
that legally constitute a crime of genocide.32 Prisoners have also presumably had organs
removed (which Beijing did openly on persons sentenced to death until 2015 → p. 214). It
feeds a lucrative traffic of “halal” organs exported to the Gulf countries.33 Numerous testimonials prove that the Uyghurs are terrorized; they fear that the smallest gesture or word
could be used against them, they do not dare to speak to strangers, and they do not know
if one day they will see their relatives disappear. Fear of the central government follows
them beyond the Chinese border, even when some manage to flee to another country.34
This psychological warfare aims to force the Uyghurs to adopt the behavior desired by the
central government: submission. This example reminds us that the “Three Warfares” are
not limited to external threats: any threat to the Party, whether inside or outside of China,
must be annihilated.
There are additional examples: the actions taken by Beijing to paralyze the enemy’s
decision-making process during the Sino-Indian confrontation on the Doklam plateau,
in the summer 2017, fit the different types of psychological warfare presented above. The
Party-State did not hesitate to regularly utter threats such as: “military conflicts to escalate
if India refuses to withdraw troops,”35 “India’s provocation will trigger all-out confron-

tation,”36 “the countdown has begun,”37 especially via the Global Times. This newspaper
also accused the Indian Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, Sushma Swaraj, of having
lied in front of the Parliament when she claimed that India had the support of the international community.38 China did not limit itself to mere words in an attempt to intimidate
its opponent: videos showing Chinese military exercises in Tibet, not far from the Indian
border, were broadcast; military equipment and logistic materiel were moved closer to the
line of conflict, thus suggesting a possible escalation of the hostilities; and memories of
the Chinese victory in the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict were revived to demoralize Indian
soldiers.39 The role that this campaign of psychological warfare played in the conflict’s
outcome was nevertheless uncertain and difficult to measure.
A third example of psychological warfare instrumentalizing military exercises can be
found in the case study on Taiwan (→ p. 423).

III. Legal warfare
Several Chinese articles have defined legal warfare as the use of law as a “weapon of
war” (以法律为武器), i.e. to dissuade, attack, counter-attack, coerce, and punish.
Its implementation consists in instrumentalizing legal principles to achieve an advantage,
acquire normative superiority, and allow the PLA to keep the initiative.40 Attaining this normative superiority is not only a question of positive law, but indeed of using all the legal
and moral principles on which the Chinese can rely to justify their actions. Legal warfare
is pursued throughout the war-peace continuum: before a conflict, it is used to set up the
right conditions and allow China to have law “on its side”; during a conflict, it justifies the
use of force and legitimizes the PLA’s actions; after a conflict, it is used to retain any gains
or to claim its due.
The practice itself is not new, but several factors, including the judicialization of international relations, the democratization of political regimes, as well as the rise of new information and communication technologies, explain its increasing deployment.41 In the case
of China, the most commonly cited examples are its actions in favor of a revisionist
interpretation of maritime law to serve its interests in the South China Sea and prohibit
access to the area, especially by the United States. Singapore-based RSIS researcher Collin
Koh explained that, in practice, Beijing “tries to take advantage of its growing military
power to constrain coastal states on the South China Sea to renounce exercising their legitimate rights, guaranteed by the UN Convention, to exploit the resources situated in their

Exclusive Economic Zones.”42 To the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the PartyState opposes “historical rights” that are devoid of any legal basis. It refuses to recognize
the decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration of The Hague which stated in 2016
that the “Nine-dash line” (the Chinese territorial claim) had “no legal basis”; nonetheless,
China multiplies incidents, involving its civilian flotillas – including its coast guards43 – and
maritime militias, as part of an offensive that falls within the “grey area” of “hybrid warfare.”44 Overall, this policy of the fait accompli puts China as a “revisionist state in international maritime law.”45 This legal warfare also includes participation in the development of
norms through international organizations, efforts within these to promote the emergence of interpretations favorable to Chinese demands, to influence individuals playing a
normative role, or to create precedents to serve as future normative bases.
Besides, the Party uses intermediaries to carry out the “Three Warfares.” In the case of
the legal warfare, United Front organizations like the All China Lawyers Association (ANAC,
中华全国律师协会) may be playing a role.46 The ANAC, for that matter, organized a Global
Lawyer’s Forum in December 2019 with some 800 organizations and individuals, and it
founded the Belt and Road International Lawyers Alliance (一带一路律师联盟) to promote
legal cooperation between member states and the BRI.47 This type of platform could be serving as a relay for the Party to implement legal warfare, for example, by allowing it to impose
its interpretation of international law more easily on its interlocutors.
A recent example of defensive legal warfare is the initiative separately taken by two
Chinese lawyers, Liang Xuguang in Wuhan and Chen Yueqin in Beijing, to press charges
against the United States as part of the Covid-19 pandemic in response to complaints
lodged by Americans accusing China of being responsible for the health disaster. Even if
this type of complaints is unlikely to result in a conviction on either side, it is useful for the
Chinese to supply a counter-narrative and turn the blame onto the actor slandering
them. Liang and Chen for instance accused the United States of having concealed the
epidemic’s emergence on its soil and undermined China’s image in naming Covid-19 the
“Chinese virus.”48 In a hypothetical scenario of offensive legal warfare, China could be
imagined as inciting Pacific nations threatened by rising sea levels to bring charges against
the United States on the grounds that, due to insufficient respect of the environment, the
US bears responsibility for its disastrous environmental consequences on these states.
An additional example is the Hong Kong national security law passed by Beijing
on June 30, 2020, and the extraterritoriality of Article 38 more specifically, which
criminalized the least violation of the law committed by anyone, anywhere in the
world. The first to be concerned are Hongkongers temporarily living overseas, especially
the thousands of students who, on Australian, American, Canadian or European campuses,

expressed support for the pro-democracy activists, as well as all those who did so on social
media, and who were hesitant to return home in case the law could be retroactively invoked
by the authorities to pursue them. Certain instructors in Chinese studies reacted quickly,
adapting their courses to limit the risks for these students without making concessions on
the content.49 Certain universities, like Dartmouth College in the United States or Oxford
University in the United Kingdom, took action: students are allowed to opt out from certain
courses and to submit their work anonymously, which limits the risks of denunciation.50
This law applies not only to students but to everyone, everywhere: all those who criticize the CCP, including this report’s authors, can now be arrested and pursued if
they travel to Hong Kong, mainland China, or even third-party countries that allow
Chinese authorities to act on their soil. Law Professor Donald Clarke concluded his
analysis of Article 38 as such: “I do not recommend Thailand if you’re in the PRC government’s sights.”51
More generally, the Chinese lawfare implies “the use or threat of legal action – to
intimidate, silence and impose financial and psychological costs” on anyone (including journalists and researchers) who work on topics Beijing hopes to dissimulate.52
In France, for example, the researcher Valérie Niquet is being sued for defamation by
Huawei France because she said, during a television broadcast (whose host and production
company are also being sued), that “Huawei is directly under the control of the state and
the CCP, which has a real power strategy.”53 In Taiwan, judicial proceedings or threats
thereof are common intimidation tactics: “the Financial Times, Taiwan’s government-run
Central News Agency (CNA), Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General
Luo Wen-jia (羅文嘉), and He Qinglian (何清漣), the author of the book Red Infiltration:
The Truth About the Global Expansion of Chinese Media (紅色滲透:中國媒體全球擴張的
真相), were the object of such ‘lawfare,’”54 recounted Canadian researcher J. Michael
Cole, one of the world’s foremost experts on Chinese influence operations. He was himself pursued by the China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC) for having taken an interest
in the role that this self-proclaimed “non-governmental” organization played in Chinese
“political warfare.”55 The same thing happened to several of his colleagues in the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, the United States, and Australia. There is another notable example: the German researcher on social anthropology Adrian Zenz was one of the first to
demonstrate the depth of the repression that fell on the Uyghurs, confirming, for instance,
the existence of internment camps and a forced sterilization campaign on women. Zenz
has since been in “Beijing’s visor” as the latter tries to “discredit the individual to deny the

repression.”56 In March 2021, Chinese media revealed that Zenz was being sued in Chinese
courts by individuals and firms from Xinjiang (not named in the article however, but they
acted as the Party’s cover).57 According to the Global Times, the BBC will be the next target
of the legal warfare “for producing fake news [and] spreading rumors about Xinjiang.”58
The aim of these charges is not to win but to “impose a cost.” These companies, with
enormous resources at their disposal, can recruit the best law firms and finance long-lasting
procedures. On the other side, the journalists and researchers they attack are alone, with few
resources. The effect is dissuasive, first of all for the targeted individuals. J. Michael Cole
admitted that, even though his case won up to the nation’s highest court, “in a way they win
because to this day I’m reluctant to write about them.”59 The dissuasive effect also extends
– which is in any case the desired goal – to the entirety of the field concerned: matters like
this cause a sensation in journalistic and academic circles, reinforcing pre-existing tendencies
toward self-censorship, as most do not wish to “have problems.” For that reason, it is not even
necessary to go through with the lawsuits: the threat is sometimes enough. Hence, Chinese
authorities and their mouthpieces, firms and media outlets, only mention the threat without
following through. In France, for instance, the director of the digital version of the People’s
Daily repeatedly threatened a number of journalists in March 2021.60

This well-known practice, known as a gag lawsuit, or procedure, but also called a
“strategic lawsuit against public participation” by the United States during the 1980s, is a
classic tool of legal warfare, obviously not limited to China. Yet, it is a growing problem,
especially for journalists, researchers, NGOs, and whistleblowers who, in numerous countries, are regularly targeted by private companies or public institutions who wish to silence
them.
The Chinese concepts of influence fit into a global framework. The CCP indeed sees
itself as engaged in an ideological rivalry with the West, first of all with the United States.
Competition with Washington is thus not only about material superiority, but also about
the imposition of values, norms, and institutions on the adversary. This is where the
struggle between Beijing and Washington differs from the Cold War: The United States
and China share the same world, they cannot live separately in two worlds with divergent norms. The CCP’s aim is therefore to impose a globalization under the aegis of
Chinese norms. It is precisely the essence of the Party’s leitmotif of “a common destiny
for humanity” (→ p. 149).

SUMMARY OF THE FIRST PART

The two most important concepts in Chinese influence operations are:
• The United Front, a CCP policy whose goal is to build up and reinforce its hegemony in
shaping forces outside the Party and in “mobilizing the Party’s friends to strike its enemies.” The
expression is relatively hard to define since it designates at once a dedicated organization (the
United Front Work Department, UFWD, under the authority of the Chinese People’s Political
Consultative Conference, CPPCC), an activity (the work of the United Front), and a system (the
constellation of organizations, institutions, agencies, and individuals who carry out this work
across all sectors: media, education and research, diaspora, economy, culture, etc.).
Concretely, its work consists in eliminating internal and external enemies, controlling the
groups that could defy the CCP’s authority, building a coalition around the Party to serve its
interests, and projecting its influence overseas to such an extent that even individuals and groups
residing in liberal societies censor themselves or avoid taking a stance against the CCP. These operations – across a broad spectrum ranging from “open” public diplomacy to clandestine actions
– generally aim at one of the following three objectives: to mobilize the diasporas, to control the
narratives about China, and to create databases.
• The Three Warfares, which represent most of the “political warfare” carried out by the
PLA, is a form of non-kinetic conflictuality aimed at winning without fighting by shaping an
environment favorable to China (i.e. to the Party) and unfavorable to its enemies. Undertaken in
times of war as well as peace, it is made up of three arms from the same body:
- Public opinion warfare, whose objective is to unite the target audiences, mold psyches
(“cognitive orientation” of the masses), “rouse their emotions,” and “constrain their behavior”;
- Psychological warfare, used to demoralize enemy forces, dissuade, sow doubt, and even
terrorize them to undermine their ability and will to fight, to weaken the bond of trust between
rulers and citizens, but also to disrupt the decision-making process in the enemy country;
- Legal warfare, which is the use of law as a weapon of war, meaning to dissuade, attack,
counter-attack, coerce, and discipline, as shown in the revisionist interpretation of maritime law,
the 2020 Hong Kong national security law, and a growing number of judicial proceedings. The
CCP goes after any individual opposed to its interests, and as frequently as possible, most often
via accusations of defamation (gag lawsuits whose goal is not to win but to impose a cost and
thus have a deterrent effect).
• The other relevant concepts to understand Chinese influence operations are the notion of
cognitive-domain operations, which aim at “shap[ing] or even control[ing] the enemy’s cognitive thinking and decision-making” and manipulating “a country’s values, national spirit/ethos,
ideologies, cultural traditions, historical beliefs, etc. to encourage them to abandon their theoretical understanding, social system, and development path”; the discursive power, which aims at
reaching domination by imposing its language and narratives; the political warfare, which refers
to the use of all means other than war available to a country to achieve its objectives; and the

concept of active measures which, unlike the preceding concepts, did not originate in the Chinese strategic thinking but in that of the Soviet Union. Notable components include disinformation, counterfeiting, sabotage, discredit operations, the destabilization of foreign governments,
provocations, false-flag operations and other operations aimed at weakening the social cohesion
of the enemy, as well as the recruitment of “useful idiots” and the creation of front organizations. Some experts have also included assassinations and terrorist actions in this.

Behind the public face of Chinese influence – the activities of the media (→ p. 172)
and of the diplomats (→ p. 205) primarily – which are analyzed in detail in the following
part, we found institutional actors whose role and nature need to be understood.1 Their
diversity, fragmentation, bureaucratic rivalries, and the occasional overlap in their missions
support the understanding that, contrary to a widespread belief – generally assumed on
authoritarian states – “China” is not a unitary actor.2 Numerous observers have indeed
shown “an excessive propensity to assess the Chinese state according to the single criteria
of its political regime.”3 But “the nature of the regime provides above all information on
the foundations of its sovereignty and on the routes to power. Yet to build a more truthful
image of the Chinese state, we must focus not on the regime but on the state as it constitutes a political center,”4 in other words, a bureaucracy. To summarize: while the regime is
strong, its political center suffers from a substantial fragmentation. And this fragmentation can impact the nature of influence operations carried out by Beijing.5 This is
why we sought to devote numerous pages to dissecting, as much as possible, the role and
nature of the different actors involved in these operations. In other words, before analyzing
in detail the different actions (Part Three → p. 143), we need to understand who does
what. As Anne-Marie Brady explained, “CCP political interference activities draw on the
resources of the Party, the Chinese state, the PLA, and the private sector in China, as well
as on Chinese companies abroad – what I refer to as the Party-State-Military-Market
nexus.”6 We will therefore distinguish these four principal categories – Party, state, army,
companies – and within each one, the agencies, departments and services most involved in
influence operations abroad.

realize them. These fragmentations constrain the Party, influence its modi operandi, but without hindering its action.

Chapter 1

THE PARTY

At least five entities within the Party are important actors in influence operations: The
Propaganda Department, the United Front Work Department, the International Liaison
Department, the Communist Youth League, and the 610 Office.

I. The Propaganda Department
The Propaganda/Publicity Department (中央宣传部)1 oversees the ideological work,2
as much in its conception as in the coordination between the structures that teach it to the
members of the Party and diffuse it to the masses.3 It develops the training programs
for Party members and for the national school curriculum, establishes the propaganda
policies to be implemented and plays a role in the nomination, promotion, and firing of
the executives in the bureaucracies that make up the propaganda system. The department
also controls the entire media spectrum – press, books, radio, television, Internet – to
which it provides the news items to cover and those not to mention, both for a domestic
audience and abroad.4
As the promoter of a unified thought, the Propaganda Department controls not only
information but also the entire cultural production of the country, leaving as little space
as possible for critique and creativity. With the 2018 reforms, the Party reclaimed certain
prerogatives previously in the hands of the state, further reinforcing its control over the
development of the Party’s narrative strategies. The Propaganda Department notably inherited supervisory and regulatory authority over the audiovisual industry,5 allowing the
Party to promote patriotic movies or those presenting China as a responsible power for

1. The CCP modified the English translation of the department’s name to replace propaganda with publicity,
without changing the Chinese name, xuanchuan 宣传, which refers to communication, diffusion, announcement, public
declarations.
2. In Chinese: yishi xintai (意识心态). The expression is commonly translated as “ideology,” but yishi refers to the
conscience, to being aware of something, and xintai refers to the state, the mentality.

example,6 but also to censor those that do not align with the Party’s vision (→ p. 346).7 This
department is thus a powerful machine, allowing the Party to shape the dominate discourse, control mass media, limit the freedom of expression and critical thought,
orient – and manipulate – public opinion, defend its interests, justify its actions, and
present itself in the best light.
Created in 1924, eliminated during the Cultural Revolution, then reestablished in 1977,
the Propaganda Department has been given a growing role since Xi Jinping came to power.
Its current director, Huang Kunming (黄坤明), is a Politburo members, as his predecessors
were, and is close to Xi Jinping with whom he worked for 20 years in Fujian and Zhejiang.8
The Propaganda Department, whose offices are located at 5 West Chang’an Boulevard (西
长安街5号) in Beijing, remains an opaque institution, but it is nevertheless known to employ
200 to 300 employees, all Party members, and to have about ten offices.9 Its budget probably
reaches RMB2.5 billion, or €317 million.10
The Propaganda Department is at the heart of the vast bureaucracy of the propaganda
system (宣传系统). At its head are several small leading groups and commissions. The
Secretariat of the Party’s Central Committee serves as an intermediary between them and
the Propaganda Department, whose director is usually a Secretariat member, as is the case
with the current one.11 The department then serves as an agency coordinating all the bodies
in charge of implementing propaganda.
The Central Leading Group for Propaganda and Ideology (中央宣传思想工作领导
小组), formed during the 1980s, is the principal authority elaborating the policy whose
implementation is coordinated by the Propaganda Department. It is currently run by Wang
Huning (王沪宁), fifth member of the Standing Committee of the Party’s Politburo, with
Huang Kunming as deputy. In 2018, the Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and
Informatization was elevated to the rank of commission (中央网络 安全和信息化
委员会), and it is now presided by Xi Jinping. The Internet being an indispensable platform for the diffusion of propaganda, there is no doubt that the Propaganda Department
follows this commission’s directives. The General Affairs Office of this commission is, for
that matter, run by the deputy director of the Propaganda Department, Zhuang Rongwen
(庄荣文).12 Likewise, the department seems to rely on another central leading group,
which also became a commission in 2018, on Foreign Affairs (中央外事工作委员会) and
dealing with questions of overseas propaganda. The Central Guidance Commission on
Building “Spiritual Civilization” (中央 精神文明建设指导委员会), similarly presided by
Wang Huning with Huang Kunming as deputy, can also be mentioned; its office is run by
the Propaganda Department. These leading groups ensure that the subordinate structures,
in this case the Propaganda Department, correctly apply the directives passed down from
higher Party authorities.

To ensure the implementation of the Party’s policies on propaganda and ideology, the
department of the same name exercises direct control or supervision over a broad range of
organizations, each with its own means to influence society. The following non-exhaustive
list presents the main ones:
• The General Administration for Press and Publications (国家新闻出版署) implements propaganda while supervising the entire press and publishing sector. Among other
things, it manages the content and quality of publications, printings, royalties, and the
import of printed works.
• The State Council Information Office (国务院新闻办公室) is in actually the same
structure as the Central Committee’s Foreign Propaganda Office (中央对外宣传办公
室).13 The deputy director of the Propaganda Department, Zhuang Rongwen, is also the
deputy director of this office. It regularly organizes press conferences, ensures that Chinese
media correctly present China abroad and accurately “explain” and “narrate” China, but
also makes sure that foreign news is communicated to the national audience with an angle
favorable to Party interests.
• The Cyberspace Administration (国家互联网信息办公室), another structure
with two different names, corresponds to the office of the Central Leading Group for
Cybersecurity previously mentioned. Its director is also Zhuang Rongwen, deputy director
of the Propaganda Department. This administration executes propaganda policy on the
Internet.
• The Central Guidance Commission on Building Spiritual Civilization (中央精
神文明建设指导委员会办公室) is generally managed by the deputy executive director
(常务副部长) of the Propaganda Department, currently Wang Xiaohui (王晓晖). The
Propaganda Department and this commission’s office manage the “Chinese Civilization”
(中国文明网) portal together, presented as the principal platform for promoting propaganda and “spiritual civilization” efforts;14 the latter refers to the promotion of the rules of
good manners, morals, and hygiene for instance.
• The Foreign Language Publishing Administration (中国外文出版发行事 业局),
also known as the China International Publishing Group (中国国际出版 集团), is the
largest foreign-language publishing house in China.
• The Propaganda Department supervises numerous newspapers and press agencies such as the People’s Daily, the bi-monthly Qiushi, the Guangming Daily, or even Xinhua,
and heads the China Media Group – also called Voice of China – which brings together
the major Chinese media outlets like CCTV, China National Radio, and Radio China
International since 2018.
• The Propaganda Department is known to be influential in institutions such as the
Ministry of Culture and of Tourism, the Academy of Social Sciences, but also with
some professional associations such as the Association of Chinese Writers (中国作家协
会) or that of journalists (中华全国新闻工作者协会).
• Finally, the Propaganda Department has local ramifications at the provincial, municipality, and district levels and extends even to neighborhoods or village committees. Local
departments have been entrusted with a broad range of activities including the control of
newspapers, media, and local cultural associations. They also manage education at their
level and health policy through anti-epidemic centers and clinics.

The Propaganda Department therefore manages a vast network of structures that
control different vectors of information capable of influencing the Chinese and
overseas populations. The content they spread is the result of the department’s propaganda policy and must conform to the Party’s ideology. The most commonly used
method to make known what should be said or omitted is to issue spoken or written
instructions. These directives have a presumably higher status than national laws:15 simply questioning them is liable to punishments including dismissals, firings (for journalists),
closures (for media organizations), and even jail time; instructions can sometimes contain
threats if the directives are not carried out.16 Such directives are apparently adopted weekly
by groups of five or six officials within the department and delivered during weekly meetings with editors in chief and journalists, followed by phone calls in subsequent days to
check in on their implementation.17
The Propaganda Department is at the head of a system that manipulates the information delivered to the Chinese each day, and which now dares to be more aggressive abroad. The importance given to propaganda meant for overseas audiences is growing,
even as it becomes less and less distinguishable from internal propaganda due to the increasing number of Chinese able to access news in a foreign language, to the size of the Chinese
diaspora, and to the growing ability of foreigners to read the Chinese-language press.

II. The United Front Work Department (UFWD)
The United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Party’s Central Committee (中
央统一战 线工作部) is the only department that constitutes the bureaucratic embodiment of a political concept, as introduced in the preceding section (→ p. 35). Emmanuel
Jourda presented the UFWD as “a sort of permanent secretariat for United Front issues,”
although it does not have a monopoly on this political action.18 Since 2017, the UFWD
has been run by You Quan (尤权), a member of the CCP’s General Secretariat managed by
Wang Huning, who oversees ideological activities and propaganda.19

A Brief History of the UFWD
• In 1937, at the beginning of the anti-Japanese United Front, the CCP sent a delegation to
Wuhan to manage relations with the KMT; this was the first structural formalization of the
United Front.20
• In January 1939, the General Secretariat of the CCP decided to create a central United Front
department overseen by Wang Ming (王明) and, in March, ordered to all services, provincial
committees, and special committees, to create a structure at their level and implement United
Front efforts.21
• From May 1944 to April 1945, the CCP established the Central City Work Department (中
央 城市工作部), overseen by Peng Zhen (彭真), who took over leadership of United Front
resistance against Japan. It ceased to function after the victory over the Japanese.22
• In April 1946, the Central Committee reactivated the Central City Work Department, with
Zhou Enlai at its head.23
• In September 1948, the Central Committee renamed it the United Front Work Department.
Lei Weihan (李维汉) took over management.24
• In 1949, the UFWD contributed to the preparation of the Chinese People’s Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), set up in June.25
• With the Cultural Revolution, the activities of the UFWD were interrupted.26
• In July 1968, two PLA officers secretly restored the UFWD.27
• In June 1973, the Central Committee of the Party officially restarted the UFWD with the
provisional nomination of Liu Youfa (刘友法) at its head.28
• In 1979, the 14th United Front Work Conference fully reestablished the UFWD structures.29
• In March 2018, the reforms launched at Xi Jinping’s instigation resolved the issues of overlapping responsibilities and lack of coordination that interfered with the efficiency and implementation of the United Front policy. The UFWD notably recovered its authority over
the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the The National Ethnic Affairs Commission,
and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Its authority over attachés and consuls in charge of
United Front activities aimed at the Chinese diaspora also increased, positioning the Minister
of Foreign Affairs in a relatively subordinate position to the UFWD on these questions.

The UFWD’s offices highlight United Front targets. Certain among them have long
existed: in 1948, the young UFWD was already taking an interest in ethnic minorities and in
the Chinese diaspora in KMT-controlled territories.30 With successive reforms, the number
of branches grew with the creation of offices for Xinjiang and the Chinese diaspora, rising
to nine in 2017 and twelve in 2018. Chinese students abroad have also become an explicit
target of the United Front policy.

In 2014, the State Council’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (subsequently integrated into
the UFWD) created “Overseas Chinese Service Centers” (华助中心) with the goal of setting
them up in 60 countries. At the end of 2018, it had 45 in 39 countries.31 Their raison d’être is
the provision of services to the Chinese community, particularly newly–arrived migrants. For
the most part, preexisting centers were simply labelled OCSCs. For example, in South Africa,
13 “Chinese Community and Police Cooperation Centers” in place since 2004 were certified
as OCSCs. They are tasked with “protecting the lives and property of individuals of Chinese
descent in South Africa by facilitating a more productive relationship with South African police.”32 In fact, they had long been financed by the Chinese Embassy in South Africa. The
heads of this network (currently Li Xinzhu (李新铸), and his predecessor Wu Shaokang (吴
少康)) are two Chinese businessmen who made a career in South Africa, and who also
head the African branch of the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National
Reunification (中国和平统一促进会) – which falls directly under UFWD supervision.

III. The International Liaison Department
The International Liaison Department (ILD, 中共中央对外联络部) is an organ of
the Central Committee in charge of the Party’s external work (党的对外工作). This work
consists in maintaining party-to-party relations, also called “party diplomacy,” and is
part of the PRC’s “general diplomacy” (总体外交). A “quiet but effective diplomacy,” to
use David Shambaugh’s words,33 the ILD’s activities draw little attention for at least three
reasons: when it comes to diplomacy, we think mainly of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs;
because party-to-party relations are not generally considered an important element of a
country’s foreign policy; and because the ILD voluntarily keeps a low profile.34 Its actions
are nevertheless not to be overlooked: the ILD has notably served as a parallel diplomatic
channel to conduct sensitive and secret negotiations, promote the revolution (it has sent
money and weapons to armed groups abroad), but also to act as a propaganda agent
which can double as an intelligence collector.35
The ILD is the heir of several successive institutions: The Communications Office
(交通局) created in 1927, the Overseas Work Commission (海外工作委员会) which
seemingly replaced it in 1942, then the 3rd United Front Bureau which took over the liaison work in 1948.36 In 1951, the International Liaison Department was created, making
a break with United Front structures. It took the name “International Department” in its
English version in 1995, while its Chinese name remained the same.37 Originally, the IDL
was in charge of the relations with other Communist parties worldwide: in the 1950s, it
took an interest in Asian parties, on the one hand, and on Eastern European and Soviet
parties on the other. With the 1955 Bandung Conference, the ILD also developed links
with socialist parties in Africa and the Middle East.38 It was only from the 1980s onward
that the ILD enlarged its range of interlocutors to include all types of parties, whatever
their political stripes. The goal of the ILD indeed evolved: it was no longer a matter of
exporting the revolution. This goal was abandoned with the emergence of the “Three
representations” theory under Jiang Zemin – a sort of Chinese Thermidor – but to
contribute to building a global consensus favorable to China.39 The ILD’s current
four objectives are to maintain relations with foreign political parties; to serve as an
analysis and observation platform allowing the Party to better understand the world;
increase the number of “Chinese friends” of all political stripes; and to reinforce
China’s soft power and discursive power abroad.40
Since Xi Jinping came to power, the Party has affirmed its will to further centralize
the management of the general diplomacy and to strengthen a “new phase” (党的对
外工作新局面) of party diplomacy,41 which entails building a “new type of political

party relations” (新型政党关系).42 This “party diplomacy with Chinese characteristics”
is meant to allow foreign political parties to “understand and respect Chinese values
and interests”;43 it serves as a vector to diffuse a positive image and history of the Party
abroad.44
Based in Beijing, the ILD has been run since 2015 by Song Tao (宋涛), who graduated
in economics and got some experience within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the
former central leading group for Foreign Affairs. Internally, the ILD is currently made up
of 16 bureaus, of which 8 are geographically specialized in the following regions: South and
Southeast Asia; Northeast Asia and Indochina; Central Asia and North Africa; Sub-Saharan
Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean; Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, and the CIS;
North America, Oceania, Northern Europe; Western Europe. ILD attachés are sometimes
posted in certain embassies – including Washington, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin – without necessarily declaring themselves as anything other than staff of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.45 The ILD also manages a front organization created in 1981, the Chinese
People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (中国国际交流友好协会)
whose Chinese name means “Chinese Association for Friendly International Exchange”;
a publishing house, “Contemporary World” (当代世界出版社) founded in 1993; and the
China Center for Contemporary World Studies (当代世界研究中心), a think tank created
in 1994.46
The ILD officially maintains relations with over 600 parties or political groups in
no less than 160 countries or regions.47 David Shambaugh delineates seven types of
ILD activities: sending Party leaders abroad; receiving party leaders of foreign countries,
especially from socialist countries; participating in, or organizing, international conferences
of political parties; promoting China’s policies and achievements abroad; contributing to
the “battle” against Taiwan on the diplomatic scene; working to advance China’s economic
modernization; and visiting foreign countries to specifically study a subject, such as the
causes of the USSR’s collapse.48 Between 1983 and 2003, the ILD might have received
some 4,500 delegations of foreign political parties for a total of 26,000 individuals and sent
abroad more than 1,500 delegations for a total of 10,000 participants.49 Since Xi Jinping,
more than 158 “presentation sessions” (宣介 会) to explain how China “succeeds” have
been organized worldwide with foreign political figures; more than three-quarters of them
have taken place since 2016.50 In 2017, the ILD organized a global summit for the first time,

IV. The Communist Youth League
The Chinese Communist Youth League (CYL – 中国共产主义青年团) was founded
in 1920 (before the CCP), under the name Socialist Youth League (社会主义青年 团).
Like the Communist Party, it was the product of three tendencies: it first emerged from the
“Western iconoclasm”52 of the 1910s. One of the leading figures of this movement, Chen
Duxiu (陈独秀), also a founder of the CCP, attributed the failure of the 1911 Revolution
to the position of the preceding generation that imagined saving China by employing
“Chinese knowledge for fundamental principles and Western knowledge for practical
application” (中学为体,西学为用). For Chen and the intellectuals who founded this
“movement for the new culture” (Hu Shi (胡适), Li Dazhao (李大钊) and Lu Xun (鲁
迅)), China could only be saved by the adoption of Western culture. They spread their
ideas via the review Xin Qingnian (新青年) (New Youth) – whose sub-heading, La Jeunesse,
was written in French – and they enjoyed a rapid success, especially among the youth. Then,
the CYL emerged from the May Fourth Movement (in 1919), a vast protest movement
resulting from the injustice felt by the Chinese youth faced with the Versailles Treaty’s decision to attribute the Shandong province (formerly under German domination) to Japan.
This nationalist convulsion stimulated a germinating intellectual fervor and marked the
birth of a form of activism among the educated youth. Finally, after 1920, the Kommintern
(created the previous year) sent advisors to China to facilitate the creation of a Chinese
section of the Communist International: first Grigori Voitinsky (born Zarkhin), the deputy
director of the Far East Comintern Bureau, then Hendricus Sneevliet (alias Hans Maring)
whose efforts led to the creation of the CCP and the CYL. The League adopted its current
name in 1925.
Like the CCP, the CYL presents significant structural similarities with the Soviet
system, in this case the Komsomol. The CYL is a so-called mass organization which serves
as a relay for the Party toward a fraction of the Chinese population. Officially, its role is to
assist the Party and it also serve as its reserve force (后备军). It is thus designed to serve
as a go-between with the youth – the CYL ensures the dissemination of the Party’s keywords and propaganda –, as an incubator for future Party executives (a quarter of CCP
members comes from it53), and to be a mobilizable force if needed. An ideal arena to
identify promising leaders, the CYL has long constituted a vehicle of social promotion for
young people. It is nevertheless seen by some today as a decaying structure which no longer
provides ambitious individuals with significant advantages.54
The CYL welcomes young individuals between 14 and 28 and it counts slightly more
than 80 million members (compared to 90 million for the CCP). Around one young Chinese
in five is a member. It thus represents a colossal force within this age group.

A. Operation and organization
The operation and organization of the CYL resemble the CCP’s. It is governed by a charter drafted in 1957. A national congress is held every four years, following the CCP’s and
whose themes it echoes. The congress traditionally opens with a speech by the Politburo
member in charge of CYL relations,55 a symbolic way to remind the participants of the
Party’s control and to convey its overall expectations regarding the mass organization. The
Party also appoints the leaders of the CYL. The League is run by a first secretary, an executive secretary and five secretaries. It has only very limited autonomy in relation to the Party
and no administrative power. It is not able to implement public policies. It is therefore
above all an organ for mobilizing people and distributing propaganda. Like the Party,
the CYL has local committees at each level of the Party-State apparatus, which are under
the dual supervision of the higher-level CYL committee and of the same-level Party committee.
The CYL supervises other Party-affiliated youth organizations: The All-China
Youth Federation (中华全国青年联合会) – a structure of the United Youth Front –
Young Pioneers of China (中国少年先锋队) – children from 6 to 14 – and the All-China
Student Federation (中华全国学生联合会56).
The CYL has its own propaganda tools, including the Chinese Youth Daily (中
国青年报57) – relatively liberal and distributed at almost 600,000 copies – and the Chinese
Youth publishing house (中国青年出版社58). The latter has published over 700 million copies of over 10,000 works since its creation in 1950.59 It also publishes a dozen
magazines, including Chinese Youth (中国青年) and Youth File (青年文摘), both with over
3 million copies distributed monthly. In 2007, the CYL publishing house set up shop in
London. Its London branch (中国青年出版总社伦敦分社 – CYPI PRESS) was ordered
to set up an international English-language publishing platform (in other languages
as well) and an international marketing network. It is meant to “present a more genuine,
modern, and beautiful China to the world.”60 The CYL also manages a central school in
which its leaders are trained.
Over the past two decades, the CYL has been marked by the rapid development of its
affiliated structures. It thereby acquired units capable of acting on its behalf and has thus
been able to develop the scope of its missions. The CYL has furthermore strengthened
its action regarding universities where it strives to better control students.61 Despite
these developments the CYL remains a weakly-funded organization with a limited budget
of RMB583 million in 2015 (€82.4 million at the time), far behind other mass organizations
of the regime.

B. CYL influence operations
Most of CYL-led influence operations clearly take places on PRC territory. The
mass organization participates first and foremost in the effort to legitimize the party in the
eyes of the Chinese youth, which is why most of its resources are deployed in China. This
mission obviously includes a defense against external aggressions. As such, it is useful to
remember that between January 21 and 24, 2019, the CCP held a seminar at the Central
Party School on risk and stability. In his opening speech on January 21, Xi Jinping underlined
two essential objectives: the prevention of major risks and the protection of economic and
social stability. The Party leader thereby urged managers to guard against eventual “black
swans” and “gray rhinos” (警惕黑天鹅, 防范灰犀牛)62 to ensure the regime’s political
safety.63 The seminar was likely motivated by unrests in Venezuela following the election
in early January of Juan Guaidó as head of the National Assembly and his contestation of
President Maduro’s power. These events thereby unearthed the CCP’s fears of a Chinese
color revolution presumably encouraged by Washington. Although Xi Jinping had
alluded to other types of black swans, linked to technology or finance for example, it is the
risk of a color revolution that haunts the regime. The Party regularly accuses the United
States of encouraging democratic revolutions worldwide and having such ambitions in
China. The Party no doubt considered that the notion of a black swan offered an efficient
means to remind Party leaders of the necessity to fight this insidious menace to ensure their
monopoly on power.
Interestingly, the WeChat account named “Island of the Knights” (俠客島) run by China
Daily and whose name refers to a swashbuckling novel, Ode to Gallantry (俠客行) by Jin
Yong (金庸), echoed Xi’s 21 January speech, explaining that the ideological fight should be
carried out online first and that the youth was its primary Internet audience.64 Activities
targeting the youth are therefore a priority for the survival of the regime.
To carry out this work, the CYL has significantly increased its presence on social
networks, naturally favoring the outlets most popular among young people. A study conducted by Ma Xiaoxuan and Anna Strelkova,65 shows the extent of this presence. It also
shows the overrepresentation of Bilibili (哔哩哔哩),66 a video-sharing platform which
allows for content diffusion along with comments embedded in the videos. The two authors
explained that this platform’s audience is very young, and belongs to Generation Z. No
wonder then that the CYL is devoting significant efforts on it.
The CYL uses Bilibili as its vector of choice for the dissemination of very diverse narrative materials, but whose general aim remains the promotion of the Party, the homeland, and criticisms of the United States. On the latter, the platform distinguished itself

62. The term “Black Swan” refers to the idea of a low-probability, high-impact event or phenomenon; “Gray
Rhinos” to a high-probability event unknown to decision-makers.

throughout June 2020 with videos using the death of George Floyd to “denounce” the
racism of the American government (→ p. 387).
The narratives spread by the CYL on Bilibili, as on other social networks, use rhetorical
tactics to gain the youth’s support, especially humor. The messages disseminated are thus
often sarcastic (→ p. 395).
To carry out its work, the CYL has also been equipped since 1993, through the newspaper of the communist youth, with a public polling center. Over the years, this center has
carried out several studies on the attitudes of young Chinese toward the West. According
to certain Chinese researchers,67 a study published by the center after the United States
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade showed the United States as the most-hated
country among the Chinese youth; it may have influenced Clinton’s China policy. It is not
possible to establish the robustness of the survey in question but the case illustrates well
how the CYL tries to acquire tools to better understand and guide young people.
The CYL thus plays a key role in the CCP’s propaganda work and provides important
support to the department of the same name. While the CYL’s actions aim first and foremost at winning over the Chinese youth, turning them into an unfailing Party ally, they also
look to use young people to distribute narrative material produced by the Party to
other segments of the society.
CYL agents have thereby become true experts in the use of social networks, on the one
hand, and in the use of subcultures likely to spread their message, such as rap, on the other.
On August 4 2016, the Chengdu-based rap group CD Rev (天府事变) uploaded the
song “Watch Out for Color Revolutions” (警惕颜色革命)68 which argued that the
United States promotes democracy to better impose its power and control over the
world. The song was in fact a propaganda operation led by the CYL. CD Rev regularly
collaborates with the CYL whose slogans and narratives are repurposed in its songs.69
They claim a lineage to American rapper Eminem and they have adopted the codes of
Gangsta Rap but the content – acting as CCP apologists – brings them far from the spirit
of the American rap movement. The imitation of American codes also contrasts with the
sharp critique of Washington, incapable of finding favors with the rappers. “Watch Out for
Color Revolutions” was met with real success and quickly established itself as one of the
most effective instruments of the anti-American discourse in the Chinese youth. It
also shows the Party’s capacity to turn American cultural codes against the United States
themselves.

The CYL was also responsible for uploading, on August 1, 2016, a video that accused
the United States of fomenting a color revolution in China, like those in Georgia,
Ukraine, and the Arab spring.71 The video, uploaded to the Weibo website of the Supreme
People’s Procuratorate, was viewed more than 10 million times in only 24 hours.72 Its
publication date, August 1, was not a coincidence, as it was the anniversary of the PLA’s
creation: as its author explained, the video was designed to support the army’s development
and its deterrent role in the face of US actions.73 It was made by Lei Xiying (雷希颖), then
a doctoral student at the Australian National University. A CYL member, and a particularly
active member in Australia, he was described by the CCP as “an outstanding youth representative of online ideological construction.”74 His thesis actually dealt with the representations of China in Australia’s media. According to his Baidu biography page,75 Lei was born
in 1987 in Fujian province. Since 2014, he has distinguished himself in numerous “patriotic” activities aimed at uniting the Chinese people behind the Party’s objectives: in 2014,
he created a commemorative map of the patriotic war against Japan (抗战爱国纪念地图);
in 2015, he produced his first propaganda video entitled “The Engine of My Country and
Myself ” (我和我的国家擎); finally, in July 2015, he participated in the 12th Plenary Session
of the 26th All-China Youth Federation Congress, where he declared:
I am very excited about the idea of returning to China to participate in the Youth League Conference.
I feel truly invested by a mission from the executive committee. I have studied and lived abroad for a
long time, and I now better understand the Chinese dream. Last year, I launched the event “Share a
Photo with the National Flag” which sparked the unexpected participation of hundreds of millions
of Chinese and foreign citizens, and showed that the Chinese dream is the common dream of hundreds of millions of people. As a foreign student, I am looking forward to learning and returning
to China as soon as possible. Knowledge contributes to the development of our mother country.76

Right, a screenshot of Lei Xiying’s video.78

In the previously-mentioned video published by the account of the Supreme People’s
Procuratorate, Lei Xiying suggested that unrests in the Middle East were the direct result
of American interventions and the revolutions they fomented. China was presented as a
stable and prosperous country under an American threat. The stars and stripes (see the
screenshot above) was portrayed as lingering behind Tibetan, Uyghur, Hong Kong and
Taiwanese separatists, behind human rights activists, behind attacks against Chinese Blue
Helmets, and behind the Japanese or Filipino actions in the South China Sea. According to
this video, the U.S. aims to destroy Chinese harmony by all possible means. It presumably
practices subversion and attempts to provoke existing tensions within the Chinese society.
The video played on pathos, showing numerous images of children and adults, victims of the unrest supposedly created by U.S. interventions.79 It was about inflicting
real “commotion”80 on the audience, hence designed to bend its will and gain support without recourse to the rational logos.81 But this goal remains hidden behind a demonstration
presented above all as “instructive” and well-argued. The persuasive process was further
reinforced by an abundance of evidence (known in Latin rhetoric as copiosus) produced in a
particularly embellished style.
The different actions carried out by Lei in the name of the CYL earned him, on May
4 2017, the May Fourth Medal of Chinese Youth.82 Lei Xiying was also a contributor to
the Internet website “April Internet”83 (四月网) whose original name was “Anti-CNN.”
The website, launched in April 2008 and inaccessible since the end of 2020, was meant to
counter the “arrogant” discourse “full of prejudice” coming from the American – and by
extension Western – media.84 It was the treatment by Western media of “incidents” in Tibet
that seemingly motivated the creation of the website which offered articles that “demol77. Source: Baidu, reproduced in Clive Hamilton, Silent Invasion: China’s Influence in Australia (Richmond: Hardie

by Rao Jin (饶谨), who was also the producer of the hip hop group CD Rev – proof of
a certain level of coordination between the different information operations carried out by the CYL. The target public, even more than Chinese living in China, was the
Chinese living abroad (especially students) as well as people of Chinese ancestry (huaqiao).
Rao Jin called on Internet users to denounce cases of biased treatment of information tied to China in Western media. The website also published articles echoing official

In terms of influence operations, the CYL can therefore play two key roles: first, in
manipulating the Chinese population to shield them from actions carried out overseas
that could destabilize the Party; next, in mobilizing the Chinese youth, especially those
living abroad, to contribute to coordinated actions. This report will show examples of this
type of operations undertaken by the CYL (→ p. 365).

V. The 610 Office
The 610 Office (610 办公室) is a particularly secret structure in charge of the fight
against the Falun Gong movement (法轮功) and by extension against all “religious
sects.” Little corroborated information is available on its precise objectives, its chain of
command and organization, on its number of employees, or even on its modus operandi.
The office’s origin is traced back to 1999, when, on June 7, Jiang Zemin convened a special

meeting of the Party’s Politburo to take measures against the dramatic rise in power of the
Falun Gong movement within the Chinese society.88 Their activities of spiritual gymnastics
were bringing together tens of thousands of practitioners, including at the highest levels
of the CCP. Jiang Zemin saw a threat to the survival of the Party, unable to tolerate the
existence of a social structure outside of its control.89 Following the meeting, a directive
established a small leading group directly connected to the Central Committee of the Party
and under the leadership of Li Lanqing (李岚清), a Politburo member in charge of solving
the Falun Gong “problem.” On June 10, the 610 Office (whose name reflects its date of
creation) was created to implement the directives formulated by the central leading group.
No text appears to have been promulgated on the 610 Office and it literally remains an
extra-legal structure.
In the months following the Party’s decision, the 610 Office opened branches at all
levels of the Party-State to structure a tight network throughout the territory. At each
level, the local 610 Office director also occupies the role of secretary or deputy secretary
of the Political-Legal Affairs Committee (政法委) of the same level.90 The Party also created Maintaining Stability Offices (维稳办公室), especially in major coastal cities, which
appear to work in close collaboration with local sections of the 610 Office and often share
the same physical premises.91 According to the Epoch Times – whose reporting should be
approached with the utmost caution – in March 2010, the government of the Pingyang
District, in Zhejiang Province, apparently announced the nomination of only one manager
at the head of the local offices of the two administrations, thus proving their integration
and common objectives. The 610 Office employs around 15,000 individuals across all
Chinese and overseas territories. The agents of this “administration” act without any
legal basis to eradicate the Falun Gong movement.
We know more about this office, especially about its overseas activities, since the
defection of Chen Yonglin in 2005, who was then a consul in Sydney and in charge of
Falun Gong. In July 2005, he described in detail Beijing’s practices for detecting, surveilling, and persecuting Falun Gong followers worldwide before a House sub-committee in
Washington.92 He explained that following the creation of the 610 Office, the Chinese
Minister of Foreign Affairs put in place an office on the Falun Gong question connected
to the national measures taken to fight the “cult.” In 2004, this service took the name of
the Department of External Security Affairs. In February 2001, the Chinese consulate in
Sydney created a special group in charge of the fight against Falun Gong. The group was
run by the Consul General himself and convened twice a month.
According to the diplomat, similar groups were created in the United States and countries
where the cult was active.93 “The war against the Falun Gong was extended abroad in 2000.
In each Chinese diplomatic mission, there had to be at least one official responsible
for the Falun Gong issue,” explained Chen Yonglin, who occupied this precise position
in Sydney, and whose mission was to “monitor and persecute” Falun Gong members in

Australia.94 Chen furthermore confirmed that the system of intelligence gathering on Falun
Gong in Australia relied on some “1000 agents and informers” at the time. Their number
was apparently at least equivalent in the United States; the two countries are specifically
targeted by the Party due to the strong presence of Falun Gong members. Surveillance
and repression against the followers are accompanied by significant propaganda aimed
at foreign governments, elected officials, media, universities, etc. to convince them of
the legitimacy of Chinese actions and of the harmfulness of the Falun Gong. Diplomats
are also tasked with detecting and keeping a record on its members, adding them to a
blacklist that prevents them from returning to China. The Chinese authorities also try to
reduce the broadcasting and circulation of media outlets created by the Falun Gong such
as New Tang Dynasty Television – today called NTD – and they finance the broadcast of
anti-Falun Gong radio and television shows. Finally, local relays of the 610 Office, as with
other Party-State actors, rely on the Chinese diasporas in the West to muffle Falun Gong
activities. Universities likely to support CCP actions are encouraged to take a public position against the cult.
Even if the 610 Office is not a leading actor in Chinese influence operations, its activities
in countries with numerous Falun Gong followers constitutes a real interference.

THE STATE

Within the state, two structures in particular are involved in influence operations: the
Ministry of State Security and the Taiwan Affairs Office.

I. The Ministry of State Security
In this assessment of the actors involved in Chinese operations, the Ministry of State
Security (MSS中华人民共和国国家安全部), the principal civil intelligence agency,
has two singularities: first, it is the most difficult institution to investigate with open source
methods. If our research into the Chinese-speaking Internet allowed us to collect numerous details about the United Front, the Taiwan Affairs Office or even the PLA – all of them
leave documents online containing valuable information – the MSS appears to be much
more careful. Little information is thus openly available. Second, information manipulation
does not appear to figure among the MSS’s primary missions. To this day, no organization
dedicated to these questions (modeled on the KGB’s Service A) has been identified within
the Chinese agency.
The MSS was founded on July 1, 1983. It resulted from the fusion of the Central
Investigation Department (CID, 中共中央调查部) – an intelligence service created in
1955 and placed under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Party – with
the first office of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS, 公安部) in charge of counter-espionage (反间谍), generally called the Political Security Bureau (政治保卫局) –, probably
the second and third offices of the MPS, and finally several units of the United Front Work
Department (统战部) as well as the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry
for National Defense (国防科工委). The deputy director of the MPS, Ling Yun (凌云)1
became the first Minister of State Security.
Several factors may have hung over the MSS’s creation and led to the decision to place
this new service under the supervision of the State Council instead of the Party’s Central
Committee. The creation of the MSS first made it possible to eliminate the CID, whose
head, Luo Qingchang (罗青长) was opposed to Deng’s rise to power – he had endorsed
Hua Guofeng (华国锋). Meanwhile, it was an opportunity to reduce the influence of the
2PLA, a branch of military intelligence, on the CID.2 Other reasons also deserve mention:
the MSS was tasked with developing operations under a non-diplomatic cover, an evolution
1. His real name is Wu Peilin (吴沛霖). After he joined the Yan’an base in 1939, Ling Yun entered the first
intelligence service of the CCP, which was euphemistically named the Central Department of Social Affairs (中央社
会 部), and run by Kang Sheng (康生).

that the CID under Luo had refused, remaining faithful to the approach developed under
Mao.3 The transformation of China’s international and security environment at the end of
the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s could also explain the creation of the MSS.4
Officially placed under the supervision of the State Council, the work of the MSS is
nevertheless overseen by two important commissions: The Commission for Political-Legal
Affairs (政法委员会) – which supervises actors charged with implementing the law – and
the Central National Security Commission (中央国家安全委员会), created at the 3rd plenary session of the 18th Party Congress in 2013 to strengthen the coherence of the CCP’s
security apparatus.
The MSS’s structure is only superficially known and numerous interrogations
remain as to the actual functions of its constituent offices. The MSS has 17 or 18 bureaus/
divisions to which must be added the affiliated bodies (see infographics). Furthermore, all
the bureaus/divisions have at their disposal front organizations to carry out operations
abroad. For example, the 4th Division uses the cover of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macau Office of the Bureau of International Cooperation Chinese Academy of Sciences
(港澳台办公室----中国科学院国际合作局). As for the 14th Division, it could be able to
instrumentalize the CAS’s Institute of Sciences and Development (中国科学院科技战 略
咨询研究院). The National Society of Taiwan Studies (全国台湾研究会) is also, according to certain sources,5 a body answerable to the MSS and used both to gather intelligence
and as a front organization. MSS agents can also take advantage of the covers offered by
different public agencies such as the Xinhua and China News Service press agencies and the
CITS travel agency (中国国际旅行社).6 The 17th Division supervises the activities of several
companies, including the Beijing Yanshan Hotel (北京 燕山大酒店), which serve as façades
during intelligence operations.

II. Taiwan Affairs Office
The Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) is also involved in influence operations, although they
do not constitute the heart of its activities. As is often the case in the Chinese bureaucracy,
it is a dual body: at once the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council (国务院台湾事务
办公室) and the Taiwan Work Office of the CPC Central Committee (中共中央台湾工作
办公室). The current director of this two-faced body is Liu Jieyi (刘结一), who used to be
a deputy director of the Central Committee’s Liaison Department. The current minister of
Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi (王毅), held the position between 2008 and 2013.
Created in 1988, the office implements the policy of the Party’s Central Committee
vis-à-vis Taiwan. This is largely formulated by the CCP Central Leading Small Group for
Taiwan Affairs (中央对台工作领导小组), now overseen by Xi Jinping with Wang Yang (汪
洋) as deputy. As a coordinating agency, the TAO guides and inspects all central and territorial
levels (autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions) organizations
of the Party-State in their management of Taiwan affairs (对台工作).7
The TAO serves as the permanent secretariat for a broad range of policies linked to
Taiwan. Cross-strait exchanges in all fields (culture, education, science, film, publishing, sports,
health…) are organized, managed, and coordinated by the Exchanges Office of the TAO.
The Economic Office coordinates economic questions, studies investment policies coming
from or dedicated to Taiwan, but also manages the different cross-strait flows – land-based,
maritime, and electronic. The Research Office follows and studies the evolution of the situation in Taiwan, the development of cross-strait relations, the policies vis-à-vis Taiwan and all
the other major subjects concerning the island. The Liaison Office is responsible for welcoming important Taiwanese organizations and experts and operates as a liaison between all the
actors involved. The TAO also coordinates all legal issues concerning Taiwan, manages the
preparatory work for any negotiation or treaty signing with Taiwanese authorities and takes
general responsibility for the management of any major event involving Taiwan.8
More particularly, the TAO oversees propaganda bound to Taiwan. Its Information
Office plays an important role in this regard to the extent that it organizes the TAO’s press
conference, deals with Taiwanese journalists coming to China, manages cross-strait information cooperation, and trains the different local departments and echelons on questions
related to Taiwan.9 The TAO also has a website used to circulate information addressed
to the “Taiwanese compatriots” (台湾同胞) who might wish to invest, start a business,
study, travel, or live in mainland China.10 The website finally relays news concerning the
PRC’s policies vis-à-vis Taiwan and the development of cross-strait relations.
The TAO oversees different media outlets – via the Jiuzhou Center for Cultural
Communication (九州文化传播中心)11 – such as the audiovisual company Jiuzhou (九
洲音像出版公 司), the Jiuzhou Publishing House (九州出版社有限公司), the Relations

Across Taiwan Straits newspaper (两岸关系), or the website www.taiwan.cn (中国台湾网)
which relays news on Taiwan – all of them vectors of propaganda diffusion for the Party.
Finally, we can also note that several organizations are affiliated with the TAO,12
including the Cross-Strait Relations Research Center (海峡两岸关系研究中心), the CrossStrait Exchange Centre (海峡两岸交流中心), the Cross-Strait Economic and Scientific
Cooperation Centre (海峡经济科技合作中心), and the National Training Centre for
Taiwan Executives (全国对台干部培训中心).
While it remains difficult to identify the exact involvement of the TAO in influence
operations in Taiwan, due to the lack of specific studies on this actor sometimes considered as of secondary importance, its role in this type of operation has been noticed by
Taiwanese actors.13

Chapter 3

THE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY

The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is not the country’s armed forces but the armed
wing of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As such, it participates in influence operations, a series of political maneuvers the CCP considers as part of its “political warfare” (政
治战). Political warfare is defined as the repertoire of maneuvers seeking to influence emotions,
motives, objective reasoning, and the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups,
and individuals (→ p. 33).1 The PLA’s role in the CCP’s political warfare is based on the Gutian
Conference resolution of December 1929, also known as “On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the
Party.” In it, Mao criticized the “purely military viewpoint” of Zhu De:
They think that the task of the Red Army like that of the White army, is merely to fight. They do not
understand that the Chinese Red Army is an armed body for carrying out the political tasks of the revolution. Especially at present, the Red Army should certainly not confine itself to fighting; besides fighting
to destroy the enemy’s military strength, it should shoulder such important tasks as doing propaganda
among the masses, organizing the masses, arming them, helping them to establish revolutionary political
power and setting up Party organizations. The Red Army fights not merely for the sake of fighting but
in order to conduct propaganda among the masses, organize them, arm them, and help them to establish
revolutionary political power.2

Hence, the PLA plays a key role in creating the CCP’s political power. It is within this
conceptual framework that influence operations (and information operations in particular),
must be understood. They are one of the PLA’s tools in asserting political power.
There is perhaps more public data available on the PLA than on any of the actors
mentioned so far. The research conducted for this report, as well as for previous studies,
show that it is possible to recover significant amounts of information from the Chinesespeaking Internet.

I. The PLA prior to the reform
The former Liaison Department of the General Political Department (LD/GPD)
(总政治部联络部) was the primary organization in charge of political warfare within the
PLA. It was previously known as the Enemies’ Work Department (敌工部). According
to the regulations on the PLA’s political work, a liaison (联络工作) is more specifically

concerned with maintaining contacts with allied forces, disturbing enemy forces, carrying
out all Taiwan-related activities, studying foreign armed forces, enemy forces, assessing the
secessionist forces of ethnic minorities, but also with conducting psychological warfare.3
Other PLA actors who likely played a role in influence operations were the second
(2PLA) and third (3PLA) departments of the PLA’s former General Staff Department and
perhaps the fourth department (4PLA) as well. Amongst other things, these military intelligence services were in charge of human (HUMINT) and imagery intelligence (IMINT),
for 2PLA, signals intelligence (SIGINT) for 3PLA, as well as electronic warfare (EW) and
electronic intelligence (ELINT).4

II. The PLA after the reform
The 2015 military reforms5 restructured the four general departments of the PLA,
including the General Political Department, into fifteen departments, all under the
direct authority of the Central Military Commission (CMC). Some of the missions
of the former GPD/LD were given to the Liaison Department of the new Political
Work Department (PWD/LD). The new Joint Staff Department of the Central Military
Commission was tasked with human intelligence. The role of the two aforementioned
institutions in influence operations is not studied in the report due to a lack of sources.
Furthermore, a new branch of the PLA was created following the reforms: The Strategic
Support Force (PLASSF) (解放军战略支援部队). This unit took over the cyber, electronic and spatial warfare domains, hence inheriting from 3PLA and 4PLA. The PLASSF
may also have acquired part of the former 2PLA’s technical competencies, though most
of the human intelligence missions were transferred to the Joint Staff Department of the
Central Military Commission (中央军委联合参谋部), and perhaps parts of the missions
of the former LD/GPD as well.
In addition to the four traditional administrative departments (General Staff, Equipment,
Political Work, and Logistics), the PLASSF has a Network Systems Department (网络系统
部) and a Space Systems Department (航天系统部). The Network Systems Department,
formerly supervised by Commander Ju Qiansheng (巨乾生)6 and Political Commissar Ding
Xingnong (丁兴农)7 (2019-2021) is said to have inherited certain missions and responsibilities in the information domain, on top of the cyber and electromagnetic domains.8

Systems Department does not appear to have been revealed at this time. It is likely that Ding Xingnong has also been
replaced. Marcus Clay, “General Ju Qiansheng Takes Command of the PLA Strategic Support Force,” The Diplomat,

职) and it shares its Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) with Unit 32069. See the transcript of Zhou Zhongyi’s

Support Force: Leadership and Structure,” Project 2049 Institute (2018).

The PLASSF is a service (军种), along with the Army, Air Force, Navy, and the new
Rocket Forces. It benefits from a rank equivalent to a theater command (正战区级), which
is the highest rank beneath the Central Military Commission (CMC).9 Since 2021, the position of SSF commander has been held by General Ju Qiansheng (巨乾生),10 the previous
commander of the Network Systems Department (2019-2021) who succeeded General Li
Fengbiao (李凤彪). The post of political commissar, meanwhile, has been held since 2020
by General Li Wei (李伟),11 a former political commissar of the Xinjiang Military Region,
succeeding Zheng Weiping (郑卫平).12

III. Base 311
PLA Unit 61716, also known as the
“Public Opinion Warfare, Psychological
Warfare and Legal Warfare Base” (舆论
战心理战法律战基地), or Base 311, was
created in 2005 in Fujian. The operational
starting date, unavailable in public records,
could be deduced from the date when the
first known commanders and political commissars of this base took office. Before the
2015 military reforms, the Base 311 was
part of the General Political Department
Liaison Department (GPD/LD) (→ p. 87).
After the reforms, Base 311 may have been integrated into the PLA’s Strategic Support
Force (PLASSF), based on the reassignment of some of its personnel.13 Its place within
the PLASSF internal structure remains unknown however. There are two plausible hypotheses: Base 311 could be attached to the PLASSF’s Political Department or to the Network
Systems Department. Besides, the base is assumed to have a rank comparable to a deputy
corps command (副军职), meaning it is led by a major general or a senior colonel. According

to Mark Stokes, it “carries the status of six conventional missile brigades” of the PLA’s
Base 52 of the Second Artillery.14
Irrespective of its specific position within the PLA, it is the only officially known
base dedicated to the implementation of the “Three Warfares” strategy. As such, it
is in charge of the operational side of political warfare. Starting in 2011, all psychological
warfare efforts against Taiwan have presumably been centralized in Base 311.15 And
Taiwan is the most targeted country in terms of information manipulation coming from
the PRC. In fact, Base 311 is suspected of having orchestrated the misinformation campaign that targeted the 2018 Taiwanese elections.16 It also appeared that Base 311 conducts
research on the informational environment in the United States.17 Affiliated researchers have published reports on the US, notably on the potential effects of legislation passed
to fight propaganda, the role of social media in American political life, such as their impact
on the political polarization, and so on.

The Base 311 is under the authority of the PLASSF, probably of the Political Work Department
or of the Network Systems Department.

This Base is an ideal case study to understand how the PLA conducts its influence operations, and more specifically information manipulation. While this unit keeps a low profile
and remains relatively opaque, it is possible to find information and data about it on the
Chinese Internet.18
Its headquarters are in Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian, a province that faces Taiwan.
Several recent official websites indicated that its address is 77 Meizhu Street, in the city’s

Gulou District ((福州鼓楼区梅竹路77号) (Image 1).19 This address seems to match a
public pool (“the Dolphins’ Pool”) however, which was mentioned on a few Internet websites as being at 77 Meizhu Street as well;20 it was seemingly confirmed by the presence of
“pool” sign at the site’s entrance (Image 2). Furthermore, a picture from inside the building
(Image 3) shows a roof that seems to correspond to the building on the satellite view of
the neighborhood (Image 4). If 77 Meizhu Street is the address of a pool, but also listed
as the address of Base 311, it could mean that this is nothing but a postal address and
that the base is actually elsewhere. And yet, a careful analysis of the satellite pictures of the
immediate environment of the pool shows a site several dozens of meters to the north that
resembles a military site (Image 5). Several details reinforce this hypothesis: the inexistence
of the Street View option on Baidu Maps for the entire perimeter (it stops at the supposed
entrance of the base, see Image 6); and the presence of several vehicles – apparently military vehicles – in the courtyard of one of the buildings with, at its center, the shadow of
what could be a flag pole (Image 7). Last but not least, the site is just around the corner
from the Huaxin training center affiliated to Base 311 (→ p. 116) (Image 5).

his real name or with an alias. As such, we rely of the conclusions drawn by Stokes and Hsiao, “The People’s Liberation
Army,” 68, note 184.

Despite a limited understanding of the Base’s internal structure, which remains extremely
opaque, it is possible to gather information on the individuals in leadership positions. No
official data is available, but the triangulation of information from various online sources
gives us a partial picture. Like in all PLA units, there is a dual management. At Base 311,
a commander and a political commissar (traditionally a major general or senior colonel) form an executive duo, usually for a four- or five-year term. The first duo was made
of Commander Deng Changyu (邓长宇) and Political Commissar Song Haihang (宋海
航), and served from 2005 to 2010/2011. They were followed by Wang Shu (王树), alias
Wang Shu (汪澍) and the Political Commissar Yin Hongwen (尹洪文), who served until
2014/2015. Afterwards, Commander Yue Lei (岳雷), alias Qiu Yu (邱雨), and Political
Commissar Mei Huabo (梅华波) were appointed.23 A new duo should soon be appointed
to Base 311 – or may already have taken command without having been officially revealed.
Unsurprisingly, the Chinese Internet provides little information on the background of
these officers, even though most high-ranking PLA officials have a Baidu page outlining their
professional trajectories. Except for Yue Lei, all of the aforementioned individuals have a
Baidu page that only provides meager biographical facts. For example, Major General Deng
Changyu, who was born in 1954 in Shandong, served as deputy political commissar in the
Lanzhou military region, then as the secretary of the political department of the Lanzhou
military region. He then commanded a unit attached to the General Political Department,
which likely corresponds to Base 311, and is since thought to have returned to Xinjiang.24
The most detailed Baidu page is that of Major General Song Haihang, born in 1955 in
Henan. It describes all of the positions he held between 1969 and 2015, including political
commissar for the Public Opinion Warfare, Psychological Warfare, and Legal Warfare Base
of the PLA’s General Political Department (Base 311) between 2005 and 2011.25 Song was
also the president of the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC), a front organization for Base 311 (→ p. 103).26 Likewise, Major General Wang Shu’s Baidu page explains
that he was born in 1958 in Hebei and graduated from PLA Nanjing Political College (中
国人民解放军南京政治学院). Besides his position as commander at Base 311, he was
the political commissar for the PLA National Defense University and a PLA delegate at the
12th and 13th sessions of the National People’s Congress.27 On the contrary, Major General
Yin Hongwen’s Baidu page does not mention his affiliation to Base 311.28 Finally, the Baidu
page of Major General Mei Huabo, which mentions an affiliation to a certain unit of the
PLA’s PLASSF (to avoid mentioning Base 311), adds that he used to be the political commissar for Chinese Air Force Airborne Academy (中国人民解放军空军空降兵学院).29
A message that confirmed Mei Huabo’s position as political commissar of Base 311 was
posted on the Sina forum, but it has been erased since (see screenshot below).30 He is the

Screenshot of the now-deleted message posted on Sina in July 2015, announcing the nomination
of Mei Huabo as political commissar of Base 311.31

Research conducted for this study revealed that Qiu Yu, president of
CHBC, is in fact the MG Yue Lei, the last identifiable commander at
Base 311. Base 311 operates through façade civilian companies,
notably the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC). All
commanders of Base 311 were also president of CHBC during their
tenure. Using an alias allowed these officers to have their face publicly
disclosed on websites that report on CHBC’s activities. For outsiders, it
is difficult to trace the actual person back to their alias, but not impossiImages highlighting the ble given that aliases are always connected to their real name. For examlink between the names ple, the Major General Wang Shu (王树) chose the alias Wang Shu (汪

澍); the Chinese characters are read in the same manner, down to the
tone, and are written almost identically.32 Yet, and although the Pinyin spelling is the same,
the difference in Chinese characters is enough to complicate any online search.
Regarding Wang Shu’s successor, prior research33 was only able to determine that a Qiu
Yu (邱雨) became the president of CHBC in 201534 but it could not confirm the real name
of the Base 311 commander. We did manage to find his real identity, or at least to propose
a very likely hypothesis. The first clue came from a military forum.35 A forum user answered

the question “who succeeded Wang Shu as Base 311 commander?” with the name of Major
General Yue Lei (岳雷), whose Chinese characters are subtly linked to those for Qiu Yu. In
each of these characters, a same “component” was retained. The “丘” is used to form the
“邱” character (Qiu), along with the “雨” which constitutes a separate word in itself. This
link was no longer a coincidence once the photographs were compared, evidencing that
the two names refer to the same individual (see image above).
Very little information on Yue Lei’s professional trajectory are available from public
sources. They only confirm that he became the political commissar for Unit 63650, a
nuclear testing base in Xinjiang, in August 2018.36 The last article we found that mentioned
Qui Yu as CHBC president was published early September 2018.37 If Yue Lei, alias Qui Yu,
effectively changed position in 2018, after only 3 years, then Base 311 has been given a new
commander.

2. An outline of the internal structure
While the Chinese government does not provide any details on the internal structure of
PLA bases, it is possible to determine part of Base 311’s structure using open source
data. The majority of the following information was gathered from online articles written
by individuals affiliated with the units in question. Most of these articles were referenced
in the Chinese database CNKI (中国知网) and the content often available on the platform
iXueshu (爱学术). Accessing the articles often provides the name of the organization the
author was affiliated with. Sometimes an official position was specified, and on rare occasions some biographical details as well – like the date of birth, province of origin, type of
diploma, and research interests. By perusing Unit 61716’s CNKI page, a number of members attached to the unit were identified. Hence, we were able to piece together, albeit in an
incomplete manner, Base 311’s internal structure.
At the very least, Base 311 has the following bodies: A Political Department (政治
部), a translation and edition office (编译室), an Information Research Office (信息研究
室), an Equipment Department (装备保障),40 as well as an Outpatient Department (门
诊部). The political department supervises at least two bureaus (处), Secretary’s Cluster
Office (秘群处 or 秘书群联处) and Organizational Cadre Division (组干处 or 组织干部
处), which are typically found inside political departments.41 It can be assumed, insofar as
the majority of the PLA’s units have the same four departments, that Base 311 also contains
Staff and Logistics departments. Additionally, the remainder of Unit 61716 appears to be
divided into sub-units (分队). If we couldn’t determine their exact number and functions,
nine were identified: sub-units 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 61, 64, and 66.42 A number of them have
the same address as Base 311: 77 Meizhu Street.43 It is likely that others do as well. It is
difficult to conclusively ascertain the mission of each sub-unit, but a number of published
public tenders point at their subject areas, such as video surveillance and network security.
40. The source did not specify whether it is a department or entity of another rank. We supposed that it is a
department (部), given that there are typically four departments in each PLA unit: staff, political affairs, equipment, and
logistics. 张学明 (Zhang Xueming) and 张书启 (Zhang Shuqi), “解读美国空军新版小型无人机发展路线图” (“A

A member of sub-unit 10, Zhang Zuonong (张作农), published multiple articles on legal
topics, indicating that this sub-unit plays a role in the “legal warfare” component of the
“Three Warfares” for instance.
Individuals affiliated with Unit 61716 were typically presented as researchers
or engineers. Engineers located there have written about information security, communication networks, and other technical subjects. Researchers have written about public
opinion and psychological warfare, usually focusing on the US or Taiwan.44 Some
of the researchers were identified as military personnel like Colonel Zhang Xueming
and Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Shuqi (Equipment Department), as well as Senior
Colonel Zhang Zuonong (sub-unit 10).45 Not all Unit 61716 members are assumed to
be members of the military however. Engineers, like researchers, are hierarchically organized within the unit. At least three tiers were detected for researchers and engineers:
researcher, adjunct researcher, and research assistant, as well as senior engineer, engineer, and assistant engineer.

Their articles allow researchers to better understand what are the topics of interest to
Base 311, and to have a better idea of its operating mode. For example, a 2019 article illustrated how Base 311 attempted to use the Internet as a tool for public opinion warfare. It
was based on the observation that traditional influence methods targeting public emotions
on the Internet (网络舆情引导) were inefficient. The authors advocated for the use of

artificial intelligence to win the public opinion warfare on the Internet (网络舆论斗争),
sometimes also known as the “consensus war.” They considered that AI could lead to
a presumably intelligent way to move public opinion.46 This article was signed by Hu
Huaping, affiliated to Unit 61716 and previously a member of Unit 61070 (a subordinate
unit to Base 311), and by two members of Huaqiao University, which is under the direct
supervision of the United Front Work Department.47 Altogether, three key findings were
drawn from the articles published by Base 311 affiliates.
• Firstly, the articles pointed at Base 311’s interest in information and communication
technologies. Almost all the engineers identified as members of the base researched
network communication or communications security.
• Secondly, information and communication technologies must be wielded in service
of public opinion warfare. This war is waged on all platforms, notably on the Internet,
social media, and via the “new media.”

• Thirdly, the purpose of public opinion warfare is to persuade and rally the population around Beijing’s narratives, especially in Taiwan.
To implement the “Three Warfares,” Base 311 uses three types of organizations:
front media companies, subordinate PLA units, and relaying platforms with which
the links are more distended and blurry. Together, they form a sprawling web, difficult to
untangle and analyze from the outside.
The front media companies are civilian organizations unofficially controlled by
Base 311. They allow the Base to operate publicly while remaining in the shadows. We
have already mentioned Voice of the Strait (VTS) and China Huayi Broadcasting
Corporation (CHBC). They were both former PLA radio stations, and are presently multichannel media targeting the Taiwanese population. Our research found a third front-company: The Haifeng Publishing House. All of these companies are potentially able to
influence populations through radio and television channels, the Internet, social
media, and books.
Multiple PLA units were discovered to be subordinates, or affiliates, of Base 311, such
as Units 61070 and 61198. Their official missions and activities are unknown, but it is possible to identify their members and sometimes access their published articles. We can then
piece together the units’ areas of focus.
A group of platforms, such as the China Association for International Friendly
Contact (CAIFC, 中国国际友好联络会) operate in the orbit of Base 311. These platforms, many of which have former PLA members as executives, serve as relays for the Base
311’s operations. By examining these three types of organizations, we can outline the base’s
activities, interests, and priorities.

46. Two different terms are used here to refer to the concept of public opinion 舆情 and 舆论. We translated them
respectively as “public emotion” and “public opinion.” See the first section (→ p. 30).

Voice of the Strait Broadcasting Station (VTS, 海峡之声广播电台) and China
Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC, 中国华艺广播公司) are actually cover
names for two PLA units. Evidence of this fact is easily traced online. The Fujian
frontline broadcasting station (中国人民解放军福建前线广播电台) was created in
1958 in Xiamen, by the Fujian province Party committee and the Fuzhou military
region. In 1984 its name was changed to Voice of the Strait.49 CHBC was originally
a subordinate station of the Fujian frontline broadcasting station.50 On November
1, 1991, it officially became China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation, creating another
public front organization for the PLA.
VTS and CHBC are both PLA units tasked with “communication toward Taiwan”
(对台广播), and whose ultimate goal is its reunification with mainland China. They
began as simple radio stations before evolving to more diverse methods of communication, seeking to reach the widest possible number of Taiwanese. After the creation of their

50. The link between CHBC and VTS was confirmed by the minutes of a trial that involved both companies
in 2013. The document, “董卫强与中国华艺广播公司、海峡之声广播电台劳动争议 纠纷一审民事判决书””

respective Internet websites, VTS and CHBC gained access to and employed a variety of
tools, such as text, audio, image, video, and social media, to achieve their goals. In an effort
to adapt to the local contexts, they have offered programs in local dialects, in addition to
Mandarin Chinese, Taiwan’s official language. More specifically, they have devised programs
in Minnan and Hakka Chinese, which are spoken in Fujian (by 20% of the population) and
Taiwan (by 70% of the population).

Two sides of the same coin, CHBC and VTS apparently share the same offices in
Fuzhou. They are located at 15 Yuandang Street, in a building nicknamed “the Building
of the Strait” (海峡大楼), likely in reference to its inhabitants. Also, the unit behind
VTS seems to have obtained a rank equivalent to that of a division (正师级).51 We
found in the report of a lawsuit against VTS and CHBC that CHBC is still administratively subordinate to VTS. Yet, its exact rank is unknown. Consequently, it is plausible
that the PLA unit behind CHBC holds a rank equivalent to that of a deputy head of
division.

1. Voice of the Strait (VTS)
The Fujian frontline broadcasting station, known as Voice of Strait (VTS) since 1984,
was created during the Chinese attack on the Kinmen Islands. Initially under the authority
of the PLA’s former General Political Department, it sought to support the offensive.52
This 1958 military operation marked the beginning of the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis,
a continuation of the Communist China’s attempt at retaking Taiwan from the nation-

alists. In August 1964, VTS officially received an official military designation.53 With the
2015 PLA reforms, and the dissolution of the former General Political Department, it is
difficult to ascertain who has authority over VTS at the moment. What is certain is that
Base 311 has been responsible for centralizing all psychological warfare activities against
Taiwan since 2011. It is also assumed that the base participates in the development of
VTS programs.54 Consequently, it is plausible that VTS now falls under the authority
of Base 311.
Since 2016, commander Ran Jiye (冉继业) and political commissar Wang Shuangyang
(王双阳) have led VTS. Wang Shuangyang has been affiliated to Unit 61716 (hence to
Base 311) since at least 2013.55 As for Ran Jiye, he worked as a political commissar
at VTS under the previous commander, Zhong Zhigang (钟志刚).56 Because Ran and
Zhong were announced as the new heads of Unit 61023 in 2016, it is possible that VTS
is Unit 61023.57 Unit 61023 is actually registered at the same address as VTS.58 Yet, 61985
is also tied to VTS. Its former general manager, Liu Linlan (柳林岚), was identified as
the commander of Unit 61985 in 2013.59 For that reason, Stokes and Hsiao defended
that VTS’s designation might be Unit 61985.60 According to them, Unit 61023 overseas
the editorial (编辑部) and technical (技术部) departments and it presumably maintains
an office in Beijing (北京記者站).61 As such, either both MUCDs are tied to VTS, or
a new designation was issued in recent years. Further research also suggested that VTS
has two local branches: Unit 61275 in Gutian and Unit 61839 in Xiamen.62

Furthermore, VTS is affiliated to CHBC. Liu Linlan, the former director of VTS,
served as the executive director of the CHBC Television Center (电视总经理) between
2010 and 2014.64 Ran Jiye, the current VTS director, is also an executive manager at CHBC.
He has been affiliated with CHBC since at least 2010, when he was director of the Network
Centers at CHBC.65 In 2012 he became one of its executive directors (总经理)66 and in
2013 he was already president of its executive committee (董事).67

2. China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC)
Like VTS, CHBC was initially a radio station, and it remains one. According to the
CHBC website, its radio programs are still accessible in Fuzhou (headquarter of Base 311),
and in a handful of other cities in Fujian province like Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou.
The programs are also available in the Taiwanese cities of Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Alishan.
Other cities where the station broadcasts include Beijing, Shanghai, and foreign cities such
as Bangkok and Toronto. CHBC’s geographical range shows that it targets Chinese citizens,
both in mainland China and abroad, as much as the Taiwanese population. CHBC radio
programs are even available online since the development of its website in 2009.68 Within
a few years, CHBC has become, like VTS, far more than a simple radio station. It
is now a multichannel company that produces podcasts and news reports, runs
forums and is available on social media platforms. One of its members wrote in 2009
that CHBC was a successful example of the integration of the “new media” as CHBC was
able to use them to increase the level of public interaction with its programs.69

CHBC claims that its mission is to develop and promote the Chinese culture, as well as
to reinforce the sentiment of belonging to the same homeland (弘扬中华文化, 凝聚同

nations:79 this is a recurring theme in the articles of people affiliated to VTS.

61716.80 His promotion in 2018 from deputy chief executive (副总经理)81 to chief executive (执行董事)82 at CHBC likely reflects a promotion inside Base 311 as well. An article
he wrote in 2015, which is freely accessible online, examined the US psychological warfare.
It was commissioned by the Liaison Department of the General Political Department and
published in the PLA’s Review of Theoretical Study of Political Work.83 In it, Chen Guojun analyzed the evolution of the US doctrine, showing how psychological warfare had become
a crucial component of its information warfare. In fact, these psychological operations
were referred to as “support to military intelligence” for a few years. According to Chen,
information should then be exploited as a weapon. He also pointed at the pre-eminent role
of the Air Force in this type of warfare, focusing first on the dissuasive effects of military
demonstrations, and then on the possibility of using aircrafts as means of communication (which has been illustrated by the numerous intrusions in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone). Chen’s interest in the US, along with others, highlights the PLA’s perception
of the US as the primary practitioner of psychological warfare, as well as its desire to avoid
falling behind.

Ai Songru (艾松如), also known as Ai Ke (艾克), is another officer who served at
CHBC for almost a decade and took a particular interest in psychological warfare. He
has been the legal representative of the CHBC’s Television Center since 2010, and he has
concurrently served as CHBC managing director and chief executive (执行董事兼总经
理) since 2012.86 According to Stokes and Hsiao, Ai Songru previously served in the Unit
6530’s Political Department, also known as the Ground Force’s 16th Battalion.87 He presumably left CHBC, after nearly eight years serving there as the last trace of his name, in
association with CHBC, was in 2017.
His publications indicate he is a specialist in psychological warfare. He co-wrote a book
about the use of psychological warfare during the Iraq War, in which he laid out the strategies on the Americans and Iraqis, as well as the role of communication technologies. The
book also analyzed the other two elements of the “Three warfares”: legal warfare and

public opinion warfare.88 In it, the United States is painted as a key player in psychological warfare. Ai Songru’s publications showed that the Chinese are studying and
learning everything they can from the latest wars in which the US was involved.89
In an article about the War in Kosovo, Ai Songru concluded that “in future conflicts, the
enemy will use all possible methods, including propaganda and starting rumors to initiate
psychological warfare.” Consequently “we must be prepared to enact counter-propaganda
and more importantly to strengthen our internal communication system during times of
war to keep the initiative.90”
Ai Songru stated in another article that the soldiers of the Taiwanese Army were profoundly unsettled when Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) took power in 2000.91 He was the first
president from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and his presidency ended decades of Kuomintang (KMT) governments. According to Ai Songru,
Taiwanese soldiers, the majority of whom were against Taiwan’s independence, no longer
knew “who or what they [were] fighting for” after the DPP took power (不知为谁而战,
为何而战), an idea espoused by others, including Zhong Zhigang (→ p. 430). Ai Songru
painted a picture of confused and fearful Taiwanese soldiers. Their confusion supposedly stemmed from the removal of the “anti-independence education” in the army and
from the split between those who supported reunification and those against it, which then
divided, even paralyzed the army, according to the author. They remained fearful of a real
confrontation with the PLA, which they saw as a superior force. They ultimately doubted
the abilities of the Taiwanese Army against mainland China and did not want to be the
“first sacrificed.” Songru believed that the DPP’s political tenure had altered the Army’s
“political mentality” (政治心态), as it had become more confused, more complicated, and
as a result, more difficult to control.

C. Haifeng, the Base 311’s publishing house
Base 311 has its own publishing house: Haifeng (海风出版社), also known as
Haifeng Publishing House; it is located at 187 Gudong Street (鼓东路187号), near Gulou
District in Fuzhou (where the base is) (→ p. 100).92 Haifeng is a common name and could

source information on Chinese companies, such as the name of the legal representatives, coordinates, names of the
shareholders, or the description of their activities. This is meant to improve transparency for the investors. Tianyancha
is blocked outside of China, but its content is sometimes archived on other websites like Baidu Wenku, as is the case

easily be confused with namesake companies.93 While the connection between the PLA,
VTS and CHBC was uncovered years ago, to our knowledge, the link between this
publishing house and Base 311 is delineated here for the first time. And yet, the PLA’s
“Three Warfares” base – or Unit 61716 – was the company’s only shareholder until 2019
and it is believed to have invested RMB480 million (€61 million) in the publishing house.94
Haifeng’s former editor in chief, Jio Honghui (焦红辉), was identified as the head of a PLA
propaganda publishing center (解放军某部宣传品编辑中心主任) in 2016.95 It likely corresponds to the publishing center for PLA propaganda support aimed at Taiwan, located at
the same address as the Haifeng publishing house in Fuzhou (福州73720部队中国人民
解放军对台湾宣传品编辑部).96 This center is the former PLA Unit 73720, but currently
of unknown military designation.97 73 referenced all units attached to the former military
region of Nanjing, which was redrawn by the 2015 reforms. Like VTS and CHBC, which
are fronts for PLA units, Haifeng is almost certainly a cover for a unit affiliated to
Base 311. Although established in 1993, the publishing house did not immediately become
a front for Base 311. Its affiliation began either in 2005, when the base was created, or in
the early 2010s, when the base became the central organ for psychological warfare against
Taiwan.

move away from Base 311, this change, which attaches Haifeng to an office that oversees Unit 61716, suggests that
the transformation was only a façade. For a reference to the ties between Haifeng and the 7th office before 2019, see:

1. The directors of Haifeng
The former director, Jiao Honghui appeared to be a photographer.98 His work as a photographer was easily traced, notably in a twenty-minute YouTube video posted by China
Southeast TV in November 2018, in which he showcased his work on the preservation
of the traditional Hakka culture.99 A number of articles on his work for the Haifeng publishing house could also be found. It includes the “Cross-Strait Photographers – CrossStrait Tour” (两岸摄影家·两岸行) project, which has brought together photographers
from Taiwan and China since 2002 in joint trips to capture and showcase the richness
of the Chinese culture.100 Further inquiries showed that someone named Jiao Honghui
– presumably the same person – is a military officer and member of the CCP, who
graduated in economics and management from the Central Party School of the
CCP and was a PLA delegate for the 11th session of the Nation People’s Congress.101
He was director of Haifeng since at least 2010,102 but likely worked there since the early
2000s. But Jiao is thought to have left his posting around 2014, when Fu Guoqiang (傅
国强) was first identified as the new director. Since then, Jiao Honghui has been deputy
president of the Photographers’ Association of Fujian (福建省摄影家协会)103 and has
repeatedly participated in the publishing house’s projects.104 In fact, the latest version of
Haifeng’s Tianyancha profile, in December 2019, listed him as the legal representative of
the publishing house.
Little information is available on his successor, Fu Guoqiang. Born in 1964, Fu studied
communication and specialized in “radio” (无线电共专业) before studying literature,
and becoming the director of Haifeng around 2014.105 Someone named Fu Guoqiang
was however affiliated with the Assembly and Inspection Office (装检所) of the PLA
ballistic force, located in Baoji, in Shaanxi – but namesakes are common in Chinese, and
for lack of sufficient evidence, we cannot say for certain that this is the same person.106

This unit had the pre-reform designation 96411.107 Elsewhere, a Fu Guoqiang was identified as a PLA delegate at the 13th National People’s Congress.108 Setting aside the two
aforementioned references, it is very likely that the former director of Haifeng was the
same Fu Guoqiang who held a position within Unit 61839 because Unit 61839 is a VTS
affiliate in Xiamen.109 Nevertheless, his tenure as director must have been short as all
references to Fu Guoqiang in this position date from 2014. And Lü Fengtang became
editor-in-chief in 2015.
Few biographical facts could be found on Lü Fengtang (吕凤堂), and there has been
no online mention of him in this position since 2018.110 Thus, he may no longer be
holding this position at Haifeng. The only reference to Lü Fengtang, cited on multiple
Chinese websites, mentioned a namesake PLA officer, affiliated to the former General
Political Department.111 If this reference were to be about the same Lü Fengtang, it could
strengthen our hypothesis that the director of the Haifeng publishing house is a
PLA officer.

Haifeng members who participated in the 2016 trip “Photographs of the Two Shores.”113

D. Other subordinate units affiliated with the Base 311
At least two other units are subordinate to Base 311, Unit 61070 and Unit 61198. Like
the others mentioned before (61716, 61023, 61985, 61275, 61590), these have a Military
Unit Cover Designator (MUCD – 部队代号) beginning with 61, in reference to their pre2015 reform affiliation to the PLA General Staff Department.114 The reform has not yet led
to a complete revision of the military designator system. As a result, it is unclear whether a
specific number was attributed to the PLASSF. The Huaxin Training Center, which is connected to CEFC China Energy, is affiliated to Base 311 as well.

Units affiliated with the Base 311.

1. The Unit 61070: A center for network propaganda
Unit 61070 is located a few buildings down from Base 311, at 3 Meifeng Street.115 It has
been identified as a Center for Network Propaganda for Base 311 (311基地网络中心),
and its director was Zhu Leiming (朱磊明) in 2009.116 According to Stokes and Hsiao, in
addition to leveraging the Internet for propaganda, the unit may have launched cyber-operations.117 The research of Professor Hu Huaping (胡华平), whois apparently affiliated
to this unit, supports this hypothesis. Born in 1967, he was the chief engineer (总工) of
Unit 61070 between 2007 and 2017. His articles described his expertise in information
network security, cryptography, and communication networks.118 Known for his participation in multiple national research projects, like the 863 Program, he won second prize at
the National Science and Technology Award from the State Council, and first prize at the
Military and Technology Progress Award.119
His publications available in open source showed that his research led to the development of a full text retrieval system aimed at improving the detection of relevant content

in the era of Big Data;120 an algorithm capable of detecting a denial-of-service attack;121 an
intrusion detection system;122 a computer worm detection system;123 and a network security
alert system.124 He also produced a study on media access control (MAC) spoofing,125 and
another on mobile ad hoc networks.126 Furthermore, Hu Huaping’s interests exceeded the
technical aspects of informational warfare: in a 2009 conference at Lanzhou University of
Technology, he spoke about the psychological warfare waged on networks, specifically by
the US and by the Taiwanese Army.127
Unit 61070 seems to have a particularly close relationship with the National University
of Defense Technology (NUDT) in Changsha. Hu Huaping is a professor there and
co-wrote most of the papers written by his colleagues at the university. It is not a random
Chinese university: NUDT in Changsha is one of the PLA’s primary scientific research
institutes, and one the best funded, according to the China Defense Universities Tracker.
This tracker was developed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) to trace the
links between universities and the Chinese industrial military complex (→ p. 296). The
University is classified “very high” risk because of its affiliation to the PLA.128 According to
the ASPI, the NUDT is directly subordinate to the CMC, it has been involved in espionage activities and is connected to foreign universities and private companies in the defense
sector. Hu Huaping has also collaborated with colleagues at the Huazhong University
of Science and Technology,129 located in Wuhan province, another “very high” risk
university (according to the ASPI tracker), due to its ties to the Chinese industrial military
complex.130 Since 2012, the university has been supervised by the State Administration for
Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND – 国家国防科技工业
局), which supports universities and supervises the defense industrial base.

Many of the research mentioned in these articles were financed by the national 863
Program,131 launched in March 1983. Its goal is to support and foster the development of
cutting-edge technologies in seven key sectors, including computer science. Hu Huaping’s
research was also funded by other bodies, notably key laboratories in network security and
cryptology in Fujian province,132 as well as the National Foundation for Natural Sciences.133
Hu’s papers helped identify the names, and sometimes profiles, of additional
Unit 61070 members. For example, Dong Hailiang (董海) and Liu Jianfeng (刘建锋),
both born in 1984, were confirmed as working on information security and cryptography.
Lead engineer (高级工程师) Yu Xinping (虞欣平), born in 1963, works on network insurance (网络工程与保障). All three were affiliated to Unit 61070 in 2010.134 More recently,
four additional people were identified as members of Unit 61070: Zhou Jingcai (周敬才),
Yue Hong (岳虹), Zhang Zhi (张智), and Yang Ke (杨科).135 Zhou Jingcai, born in 1982,
and Yue Hong, born in 1980 are both from Hubei and work on network information security.136 Yue Hong is a PhD, lead engineer, and member of the China Computer Federation (
中国计算机学会).137 Ai Ran (艾然), another member of Unit 61070, appears to be working on communication techniques and propaganda. For example, he has worked on topics
tied to the use of specific writing styles for external communication, using the overseas edition of People’s Daily as a case study,138 as well as on the effectiveness of narrative processes
in military affairs reporting. For the latter, he studied how the media covered the national
holiday military parade.139

Biographical note for the authors of the article “Design and Implementation
of Lucene-based Full-Text Retrieval System” (2015). The authors are members of Unit 61070.140

Biographical note for Yue Hong, member of Unit 61070.141

Finally, it is notable that the address referenced for a number of these articles is
77 Meizhu Street (Base 311), and not 3 Meifeng Street (Unit 61070), which confirms
the link between Unit 61070 and Base 311.142 The research of Unit 61070 members,
briefly described in this section, align with the focus of Base 311. More specifically, they
address topics related to public opinion warfare, and to a lesser extent psychological
warfare.

2. Unit 61198
Unit 61198 is registered at the same address as Base 311, 77 Meizhu Street. It is
thought to be affiliated to the Unit 61716’s translation bureau.143 Similar to Unit 61070, a
number of articles written by individuals affiliated to Unit 61198 helped the authors iden140. This article is available here: http//archive.ph/ndzvB.

tify its members and research areas. Wang Wei (王维), born in 1970, was a lead engineer
for Unit 61198 from 2011 to 2017 at least. Like many others from Unit 61070, he worked
on network security. His papers, often co-written with NUDT researchers, explored communication architecture,144 computer worm detection systems,145 a trust model to choose
a cloud computing service,146 or a research algorithm.147 His work was funded by the same
bodies that supported Unit 61070’s research: the national 863 Program, the National
Foundation for Natural Sciences, and laboratories on network security and cryptology in
Fujian province. Another member affiliated to Unit 61198 published a 2015 article on satellite positioning,148 and a 2016 article on the benefits of computerizing military financial
services.149
Moreover, some topics are less technical. A 2010 article, for instance, written by four
unit members, explored a trust mechanism that could foster trust and better military
relations between China and Taiwan.150 Other papers studied Japan’s method of “integration to the empire” during its occupation of Taiwan,151 and two others detailed the
American use of psychological warfare outside of armed conflicts.152 More recently,
in 2016, three unit members co-wrote an article that called for the development of a
strong army capable of winning wars.153 To conclude, Unit 61198’s research interests, like those of Unit 61070, include network communication, psychological
warfare, and Taiwan. The subjects are thus aligned with the interests of Base
311.

3. The Huaxin Training Center
Stokes and Hsiao claimed that Base 311 is supported by the Huaxin Training Center
(华信培训中心)154 which is located at the same address as Unit 61070, 3 Meifeng Street (
梅峰路3号).155 Little is known about the training center, or about the type of support it
provides to Base 311. Research on the name returned a namesake hotel at the address
(see above), with 74 rooms over 13 floors. The Huaxin Training Center Hotel is said to
have opened in 2011.156 In conducting the research for this report, the authors found that
it was impossible to reserve a room at this hotel, regardless of the reservation website
used. There were no client reviews,157 nor is the hotel closed because of the Covid-19 (other
hotels in the neighborhood were partly open). Moreover, the hotel’s website was rather
unprofessional and its map located it in the wrong Fuzhou neighborhood. These facts suggest that the Huaxin Training Center was not what it claimed to be, and that it was
most likely affiliated to a PLA unit, something we already know.

The Huaxing Training Center may belong to the former Fujian-based company Huaxin
Holdings Co. Ltd (福建华信控股有限公司),159 and it was perhaps funded by it. Huaxin
Holdings was founded in September 2005 – the same year as Base 311 – by CEFC
China Energy Co. Ltd (中国华信能源有限公司) and nicknamed Huaxin. In 2014 Lan
Huasheng (兰华升) took over the company, renaming it Fujian Dasheng Holdings Co. Ltd.
(福建大生控股有限公司).160 Yet, the company retains ties to CEFC China Energy; Lan
Huasheng used to collaborate with Ye Jianming (叶简明) the founder and chairman (独
立董事) of Huaxin and he has been an independent board member of the company since
2006.161 One of the most important private companies in China, Huaxing Holdings
was created by Ye Jianming when he was only 20 years old.162 Lan is also the executive
director of the China Academy of Culture (中国文化院).163 This organization, founded by
the China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC, 中国能源基金委员会) – the CEFC’s think
tank – is part of the “Huaxin nexus.”164
The CEFC think tank was identified as a platform for political warfare, affiliated
to the former General Political Department. Its links to the PLA and the Party have been
well documented.165 For instance, J. Michael Cole explained that the CEFC China Energy
think tank rented office space in Base 311’s offices.166 Ye Jianming, founder of Huaxin,
was also known for his membership to another organization linked to the former General
Political Department during the 2000s: the CAIFC.167 Besides, Huaxin’s think tank made
headlines on multiple occasions. In 2011, a former PLA officer who worked there gained
attention after he published a piece in the Global Times about the need for greater demonstrations of force in the South China Sea.168 In 2017, its former director Patrick Ho (何志

160. Between 2005 and 2014, the principal shareholder of Fujian Huaxin Holdings was the CEFC (Shanghai)
Group Co. Ltd. (上海石油集团有限公司 then上海华信国际有限公司), a subsidiary of CEFC China Energy
created in 2003. Since 2014, the principal shareholder of Fujian Huaxin Holdings, which became Fujian Dasheng
Holdings is 90% owned by Lan Huasheng. Its named cane be translated as Shanghai Zhongmao Chuangfu Equity

平) was arrested and found guilty of conspiracy, money laundering, and of violating the law
against corruption abroad.169 This businessman and former Secretary of Internal Affairs
in Hong Kong (2002-2007), was accused of bribing foreign officials, allegedly giving two
million dollars to the president of Chad in 2014, through the CEFC’s non-governmental
and non-profit branch, the China Energy Fund Committee, to facilitate the conglomerate’s development abroad.170 The important number of scandals in Africa and Eastern
Europe – the Czech president Miloš Zeman named Ye Jianming as his “economic advisor”
in 2015171 (→ p. 265) – and at the UN172 finally convinced the NGO Committee to cancel
the CEFC think tank’s special consultative status at the ECOSOC173 it had received in 2011,
in 2019. Ye Jianming’s arrest, which closely followed Patrick Ho’s, sealed the fate of one
of China’s most powerful conglomerates,174 as the CEFC officially declared bankruptcy
in March 2020.175

Evidence of the connection between Base 311 and CEFC China Energy (Huaxin).

While Huaxin Holdings in Fujian was founded in 2005, the same year as Base 311, we
ignore when it was affiliated to Base 311. But Huaxin and the CHBC began collaborating
in 2014, when they co-organized the Chinese Culture Development Forum (→ p. 433).176

The China Academy of Culture, which emanated from the CEFC think tank, was originally
behind the forum.177 The relationship between Huaxin and CHBC likely began a few years
prior. In a 2012 speech, CHBC executive Ai Songru thanked Huaxin for its support during
an event the CHBC was invited to.178 Besides, the hotel named after the Huaxin Training
Center opened its doors in 2011, which could be identify the start of the collaboration
between Huaxin and CHBC.179 In addition, Zheng Yong (郑永), an executive at the
Dasheng group (大生) owned by Lan Huasheng, held a position at CHBC between 2012
and 2014.180

IV. A web of relaying platforms
A nexus of associations, non-profit NGOs, and other civilian facades – with blurry
links to the Chinese authorities – plays a role in the implementation of influence operations.
The organizations that make up this web of actors, irrespective of their proximity to the
central government, are all platforms conducing to PRC influence operations. They
serve the government to varying degrees, at times only facilitating its operations.
As such, they are referred to as “relaying platforms.” This report does not aim to create
an exhaustive list of these organizations, but rather to present the main organizations with
direct links to the PLA, the China Association for International Friendly Contact (CAIFC),
the China Association for Promotion of Chinese Culture (CAPCC), as well as the China
Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification (CCPPNR), which has ties
to the Party, and the China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF). The latter is an
example of an organization orbiting at a distance from the nexus, but that still deserves a
particular attention.
This nexus is sprawling. Many people accumulate or consecutively occupy key
positions in a number of these organizations. The former vice president of the National
People’s Congress (NPC), Xu Jialu (许嘉璐), is one of them. A respected intellectual
known for promoting Chinese values and culture around the world, Xu Jialu has served as
president of the CAPCC, honorary president of the CCPPNR, founder and president of
the Nishan Forum on World Civilizations’ organizing committee, principal advisor to the
CAIFC, president of the CEFC advisory committee, and president of the China Academy
of Culture.181
A number of officers from the former General Political Department’s Liaison Department
(GPD/LD) have held positions in these organizations. This is particularly the case of the
CAIFC, which was under the direct authority of the GPD/LD.182

anti-American platform that supported the former General Political Department in
developing the “Three Warfares.” Du Rubo’s writings in particular are said to have contributed to the “Three Warfares” strategy, notably his 1990 book Introduction to psychological
warfare (心理战概论), co-written with Wen Jinquan (温金权) and Zhou Min (周敏).190

A. CAIFC – China Association for International Friendly Contact (中
国国际友好联络会)
Modeled after the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries
(CPAFFC, 中国人民对外友好协会),193 the CAIFC was created in 1984. According
to Stokes and Hsiao, it is one of the most important platforms relaying PLA and
CCP influence operations. It was a direct subordinate to the GPD/LD, probably its
Investigation and Research bureau.194 This is why multiple GPD/LD officers held positions
at the CAIFC. Today, the association is presumably under the authority of the new Liaison
Department in the Political Work Department (PWD/LD). Moreover, Chen Yuan (陈元)
is its current director. Xin Qi and Deng Rong (邓榕), the daughter of Deng Xiaoping, and
Yi Xian (乙先), who is also vice president of CAPCC, are the CAIFC’s vice presidents.
Finally, Liang Hongchang, is also still a member of the CAIFC board of directors, under
the alias Liang Shi.195

The CAIFC’s mode of operation consists in making contact and cultivating relationships with foreign elites, in the defense sector especially, but also with lawmakers and
other influential actors in target countries. Its aim is to diffuse a positive image of China
through them.196 Henry Kissinger is an “old friend” of the CAIFC197 for instance. And
the US-China Sanya Initiative is an example of a CAIFC project that was created to foster
better relations with the US military elite (see section below).
At the provincial level, there are Associations for International Friendly Contact (AIFC)
as well. And the Liaison Department directors of the former military regions’ political
departments served as deputy directors of these AIFCs.198 It can be assumed that these

overlaps were reproduced with the new command theaters of the post-2015 reform structures. For example, the Jiangsu Association for International Friendly Contact was tied to
the Nanjing military region.199
The CPDS, created in 1984, is also affiliated to the CAIFC.200 According to Stokes and
Hsiao, the CPDS functioned as the principle former GPD/LD think tank, and has likely
reprised its role with the current PWD/LD; it apparently supports the MSS as well.201
Finally, the CPDS publishes a bimonthly review about international relations, called Peace
and Development (和平与发展).

1. The US-China Sanya Initiative: how to influence US generals
Since 2008, the CAIFC has organized the US-China Sanya Initiative (中美高级退役将
领交流活动), officially named the “US-China High-Ranking Retired Generals Exchange
Initiative,” in partnerrship with the EastWest Institute (EWI). The EWI is an NGO that
promotes international dialogue and acts as a platform for informal diplomacy. The initiative’s English name refers to the city of Sanya, in Hainan province in China, where the first
dialogue was held in 2008. The event is sponsored by the CUSEF (→ p. 125) and, in 2018,
the program celebrated its 10th anniversary.
According to the organizers and participants, the goals of the initiative are to improve
communication and mutual understanding, as well as to create a space for cooperation in
case of a crisis.202 These dialogues often take place in Beijing over the course of a day
or two of informal discussions. The Chinese and American delegations typically discuss
a variety of topics of interest, including Chinese-American military relations, conflicts in
the South and East China seas, the Korean peninsula, counter-terrorism, cyber security,
or Taiwan and its relationship with China. These exchanges always coincide with current
events, such as Xi Jinping’s visit to the US, the US elections, or the 2016 arbitration of the
South China Sea dispute by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.203
During the day, the participants meet with one or multiple important American or
Chinese figures. In fact, the delegations were invited to meet with GPD directors on
multiple occasions: General Zhang Yang (张阳) in 2013 and 2015 and General Miao
Hua (苗华) in 2017 and 2018. They met other important Chinese military figures like
General Xu Qiliang (许其亮), vice president of the CMC in 2015, and Lieutenant General
Li Zuocheng (李作成) in 2013, at the time commander of the Chengdu military region
but now a general and the Joint Chiefs of Staff director. In 2016, the 7th dialogue took
place in Washington, D.C. and New York. This allowed participants to meet high ranking American officials like Senators John McCain and Tom Cotton, Representative Rick
Larsen, then-Deputy Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel,
and Maurice R. Greenberg, president of CV Starr & Co. Inc.
The US delegation was led by (retired) Admiral William A. Owens, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Owens has publicly pushed for better US-China relations,
opposed the Taiwan Relations Act which he considered detrimental to the US, advocated for

the end of US weapon sales to Taiwan, and encouraged the development of US-Chinese
economic relations – positions that Beijing favors.204 Since his retirement, Admiral Owens
is believed to have defended Chinese interests through his appointment to various boards
of directors. With the help of Amerilink, a firm he created in 2009, he tried to help his first
client, Huawei, enter the American market, by winning a contract with the telecommunications company Sprint Nexel. Probably to quell concerns regarding Huawei’s connection to
Beijing, he enlisted the help of former congressman Richard Gephardt and former World
Bank president James Wolfensohn. While Alcatel and Samsung were eventually awarded
the contract, Owens’ efforts resulted in Huawei being one of the final six companies considered.205
Among the influential officers who participated in these dialogues were General Ronald
R. Fogleman, former Air Force Chief of Staff, Admiral Timothy J. Keating, former commander of the Pacific Command (PACOM), General Charles H. Jacoby, former commander
of the Northern Command (NORCOM), General John Abizaid, former commander of
the Central Command (CENTCOM), and General Walter L. Sharp, former commander of
the US forces in Korea. On the Chinese side, the US-China Sanya Initiative is managed by
three people, Xin Qi and Yi Xian, both vice-presidents of the CAIFC, and Li Haoyu (李浩
宇), secretary general of the CAIFC. Stokes and Hsiao hypothesized that Haoyu was also
the former director of the GPD/LD investigation and research bureau.206

B. CAPCC – China Association for Promotion of Chinese Culture (中
华文化发展促进会)

According to Stokes and Hsiao, the Central Military Command (CMC) was the driving
force behind the creation of the CAPCC in 2001. The CAPCC was apparently founded to
become the principal PLA platform for political work dedicated to Taiwan, under the
authority of the former GDP/LD.208 It should not be confused with the Chinese Culture
Promotion Society (中华文化促进), which has an almost identical name in Chinese. In 2020,
for unknown reasons, the CAPCC’s website was no longer accessible even though it had still
been working in the summer 2019.209 The CAPCC is one of the organizers of the Chinese
Culture Development Forum (→ p. 433), alongside the CEFC China Energy’s China Culture
Academy, CHBC, the UFWD-affiliated All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, the
Want Daily and the China Review News.210 The CAPCC is apparently managing the commercial
company Huayi Audio Visual ((中国华艺音像实 业有限公司), the CEO of which, Bao
Lixian (鲍立衔), was deputy director of the CAPCC.211 The association also appears to have
a close working relationship with the China Review News and the PLA Academy of Military
Science.212 The last identified CAPCC president was Wang Zhengwei (王正伟) who had spent
the majority of his career in his native autonomous region of Ningxia before becoming vice
president of the CPPCC and deputy director of the UFWD.213

C. CCPPNR – China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National
Reunification (中国和平统一促进会)

Created in 1988, the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification
(CCPPNR) has a very close working relationship with political authorities. Members
of the CCPPNR bureau hold positions in the Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the standing committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC),
and the United Front Work Department (UFWD).
Each year during the NPC, the CPPCC gathers and consults with various political parties, representatives of ethnic groups, and other organizations. Wang Yang (汪洋), the current CPPCC president, is also the president of the CCPPNR. In fact, the presidents of

the eight democratic parties that are allowed to exist alongside the CCP are vice
presidents of the CPPCC and of the CCPPNR. Some are members of the NPC’s
standing committee as well. The eight parties are:
• Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK, 中国国民党革命委
员会) – President: Wan Exiang (万鄂湘);
• China Democratic League (CDL, 中国民主同盟) – President: Ding Zhongli (丁仲礼);
• China National Democratic Construction Association (CDNCA, 中国民主建国会) –
President: Hao Mingjin (郝明金);
• China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD, 中国民主促进会) – President:
Cai Dafeng (蔡达峰);
• Chinese Peasants’ and Workers’ Democratic Party (CPWDP, 中国农工民主党) –
President: Chen Zhu (陈竺);

• Jiusan Society (JS, 九三学社) – President: Wu Weihua (武维华);
• Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSGL, 台湾民主自治同盟) –
President: Su Hui (苏辉).
Among the other political personalities who jointly held vice presidential positions at
the CPPCC and the CCPPNR, we noted Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai (帕巴拉·格列朗杰),
president of the Autonomous Region of Tibet, Zheng Jianbang (郑建邦), RCCK member,
and Gao Yunlong (高云龙), CDNCA member.214
The National People’s Congress (全国人民代表大会) is made up of some 3,000 representatives, indirectly elected for five years, who meet once a year in session. Most seats are held by CCP
members, but there are also independent representatives and members of the eight authorized parties. The NPC does not have any real legislative or executive power as it remains under the authority of the CCP. Its role is largely symbolic. The NPC’s standing committee is composed of 175
people, including multiple CCPPNR vice-presidents: Wan Exiang (RCCK), Chen Zhu (CPWDP),
Ding Zhongli (CDL), Hao Mingjin (CDNCA), Cai Dafeng (CAPD), or Wu Weihua (JS).
Finally, You Quan (尤 权), the CCPPNR secretary general and second in command,
and Tan Tianxing (谭天星), are respectively the director and deputy director of the CCP’s
Central Committee UFWD. You Quan is also secretary of the CCP Secretariat.
The CCPPNR has developed a network:of offices on all continents. According to a 2019
study by the Jamestown Foundation, it is present in 91 countries, including France, the
United Kingdom, the US, Canada, and Australia.215

D. CUSEF – China-United-States Exchange Foundation (中美交流基
金会)
The China-United-States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF), which sponsors numerous
CAIFC events, like the US-China Sanya Initiative, has also funded a variety of dialogues,
programs, and exchanges between the US and China. Created in 2008 in Hong Kong,

the CUSEF describes itself as an “independent, non-profit, privately funded, and non-governmental foundation… [that] builds platforms to encourage constructive dialogue and
diverse exchanges between the people of the US and China.” But it functions as a de facto
front organization for the PRC government216: it is one of the most active United
Front relays working in the US. Links between the CUSEF and UFWD are well-established. The founder and president of the CUSEF, Tung Chee-Hwa (董建華), a former
executive chief of Hong Kong (1997-2005), was also the vice president of the CPPCC’s 21th
National Committee. Besides, the CUSEF board of directors includes known UFWD and
CCP members.217 Liu Changle, the CEO of Phoenix Media Investment (Holdings) Ltd. and
founder of Phoenix Television, is on the board of directors for instance. Phoenix Television
is a rare non-governmental stations authorized in China, pointing to Liu Changle’s close
relationship to the CCP.218 Finally, Henry Kissinger is CUSEF’s honorary advisor.219
Apart from the US-China Sanya Initiative, which it has supported since its inception, the CUSEF sponsors a number of
high-level dialogues. Similarly to the Sanya dialogue, but with
non-military participants, the US-China High-Level
Political Party Leaders Dialogue (中美政党对话) brings
together political leaders. Organized with the CCP’s
International Liaison Department (ILD) and the EastWest
Institute, this dialogue offers a delegation of American politicians (Democrats and
Republicans) the opportunity to meet with CCP members and discuss current events. The
10th dialogue, which took place in 2017 in Beijing, was led by Song Tao, the ILD minister,
Martin O’Malley, former Democratic governor of Maryland, and Alphonso Jackson, the
former Republican Housing and Urban Development Secretary.220
Additionally, alongside the EWI and the China Institute of International Studies, the
CUSEF organizes the US-China High-Level Security Dialogue, which allows scholars, former and current government representatives, military officers, and Chinese and
American CEOs to exchange and produce recommendations for decisionmakers in both
countries, hence fostering mutual understanding.221 Among its other events, the CUSEF
sponsored the Conference on US-China Infrastructure Cooperation (中美基础设施建设
合作研讨会) in 2017 with the EWI and the China Institutes of Contemporary International
Relations (CICIR), a think tank believed to be an office of the MSS.222 It also supported
the Forum on China-US Relations, organized in Suzhou in 2016 with the Chinese People’s
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), the Shanghai Institute for
International Studies, and the Carter Center (a US think tank). They have also sponsored
“China Forums” in elite US universities like New York University, the University of
Chicago, and Johns Hopkins. In 2019, the CUSEF and the China Center for International

Economic Exchanges jointly organized the “US-China Trade and Economic Exchanges:
What Now, What Next” (中美经贸关系现状与前景) in Hong Kong.223
Despite being registered as a “foreign agent” in the US, the CUSEF funds research
center and projects in American universities and think tanks, including at some
influential institutions in Washington. This funding became controversial when it was
revealed in 2017 that the CUSEF partially funded a new chair in China Studies at the prestigious School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of John Hopkins University.224
The foundation’s academic projects are only “the tip of the iceberg” however. The CUSEF
is involved “in a much larger, multi-faceted effort to exert influence on US policy,”
notably as a sponsor of lobbying activities directed at Congress, as well as to local
and federal authorities.225
To do so, it uses intermediaries, including American PR firms (at least 7 since
2010).226 For instance, these firms manage a website funded by the CUSEF, chinausfocus.
com, created in 2011 (with a Chinese version in 2015), in addition to other publications.227
John Dotson explained that “this practice – of using a public relations firm to manage
synthetic think tank publication, which in turn published material that aligns with PRC
propaganda narratives – matches a pattern seen elsewhere in the world, as with the Sinoskop
website launched in the Czech Republic in 2019.”228 These activities “represent a sort of
‘lobbying laundering’ in which a nominally independent third-party organization
acts as a primary agent for funding and managing lobby efforts on behalf of the
PRC.”229
In 2015 and 2016, the CUSEF also brought delegations from the Center for American
Progress, a Washington-based think tank, to China. In 2016, the delegation met with “Zhang
Gaoli (张高丽), then-PRC Vice Premier and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing
Committee; Jin Liqun (金立群), president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank;
and Admiral Sun Jianguo (孙建国), deputy chief of the PLA Joint Staff Department.”230
The CUSEF’s exchange programs target more than military and political leaders: many
are geared toward students. These programs offer students the opportunity to visit China
and they are usually organized in collaboration with the CPAFFC. Students from Columbia
University, the University of Chicago, Harvard (Kennedy School of Government), UC
Berkeley, Georgetown, and Johns Hopkins (SAIS) have already been invited to visit China
for instance. Other programs target American media representatives. Staff members from
The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Chicago Tribute, the National Public Radio, Vox, Bloomberg,
Reuters, and Forbes have participated in CUSEF programs.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES AS
DATA COLLECTION TOOLS

Influence operations require massive amounts of data, on which they depend
to know whom to influence, when, and how. Beijing uses “two combined approaches:
‘bulk data collection’ and targeted data collection.”1 Bulk data collection refers to the use
of numerous sensors to harvest large amounts of data, and Chinese services – due to their
large workforce and advanced algorithms – are particularly well equipped to analyze it.
Data collection is done through espionage and cyber-attacks (the 2018 data breach at
the Australian National University and the 2019 cyberattack on the Australian parliament
for instance, likely in order to build detailed profiles of individuals), but also by co-opting regimes, building infrastructures, developing new technologies. It heavily relies
on public and private companies. According to Samantha Hoffman, “[to] get access to
global data, the Party uses state-owned enterprises, Chinese and foreign technological firms,
and others partners such as university researchers. The CCP [is] using capitalism as a vehicle
to access data that can help it disrupts democratic processes and create a more favorable
global environment for its power.”2
The nature of the Chinese regime, a one-party state where the state is an institutional
façade with no real power, forces all sizable companies to closely engage with the Party.
These ties provide Party executives with access to companies – many they help fund through
Chinese banks, which are primarily politically-minded. In fact, no important company in
China can prosper without aligning itself with the Party. Since Xi Jinping came to
power, this trend has only increased with the adoption of the Made in China 2025 program, the Belt and Road Initiative, and AI development plans. The Party’s growing control
over the strategy of high-tech companies has led Chinese firms in this sector to hire Party
members, to expand the companies’ network, obtain political protection, and consequently
become more competitive.
In 2015 China elevated the military-civil fusion (军民融合) as a national strategy.3 In
January 2017, the government established the Central Military-Civil Fusion Development
Committee (中央军民融合发展委员会) and the publication of the Special Plan for
Scientific & Technological Military-Civil Fusion (科技军民融合发展专项规划). The
goal was to facilitate innovation in dual technologies in key sectors, such biology,
the space industry, artificial intelligence, and information technologies.4 To do

so, the government pushes private sector companies and research centers to collaborate
with the public-sector defense industry. This program came from a desire to accelerate
the PLA’s modernization and to convert civilian technological innovations into
military gains.
These efforts were also part of a larger strategy aimed at strengthening the Party’s
control over the private sector. In 2016, Xi Jinping argued for a modernization of the
management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by integrating “CCP objectives in all
aspects of corporate governance,” which led many SOEs to amend their internal structure to include a role for the Party in daily corporate matters.5 Then, in 2017, Article
7 of the National Intelligence Act mandated all Chinese companies, public or
private, as well as all citizens to “support, aid, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts, in accordance with the law, and protect national secrets, related to
intelligence activities, they are aware of.”6 The Canadian Security Intelligence Service
(CSIS) explained that this law “applies to Chinese companies and individuals abroad
[…] pointing to the judicial cooperation between the CCP and Chinese companies and
citizens.”7 On September 15, 2020, this trend was reinforced when the CCP issued the
“Opinion on Strengthening the United Front Work of the Private Economy in
the New Era,”8 which institutionalized the Party’s influence over Chinese companies. For Scott Livingston, “the fact that China has released this opinion at a time of
heightened US scrutiny over the government’s links to Huawei […] suggest that China
feels confident enough in its system that it is now prepared to advance and defend it
on the global stage.”9 In the end, the Party seems ready to openly assume these links
and the lack of autonomy of the private sector with regard to the best interests of
the Party.

I. Infrastructure
A. Buildings (the example of Africa)
In January 2018, Le Monde revealed that the headquarters of the African Union (AU)
had been bugged, which was confirmed by the Financial Times three days later.10 The building, constructed in Addis-Ababa in 2012 by the China State Construction Engineering
Corporation (CSCEC), was filled with microphones. Backdoors were discovered in the IT
system, which was installed at the time of the construction of the building, and Chinese
intelligence was able to capture “all of the organization’s exchanges and internal produc5. Lin Yu-Hsin and Curtis Milhaupt, “Party Building or Noisy Signaling? The Contours of Political Conformity

tions.”11 The AU uncovered the hack in 2017 when it noticed high levels of traffic on its
servers at night, when the offices were empty. Every night AU data was transferred to
servers in Shanghai. This scandal made the headlines globally, highlighting the risks associated with Chinese-built infrastructure, particularly (yet not only) in Africa, where they are
particularly numerous.
A 2020 report pointed out that Chinese companies built or renovated at least 186
government buildings in Africa since 1966, including “at least 24 presidential or prime
minister residences or offices; at least 26 parliaments or parliamentary offices; at least 32
military or police installations; and at least 19 ministries of foreign affairs buildings.”12 The
Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE have set up at least 14 sensitive government
telecommunication networks, including systems used by police and armed forces. The
Chinese government also provided office equipment, like computers, to at least 35
African governments. The majority of these companies are SOEs, though even private
sector companies are now beholden to the CCP collaboration law, specifically in terms of
data collection. The information harvested through infrastructure and equipment
can be used to recruit potential intelligence assets or compromise and coerce leaders – including personal information on the habits and preferences of numerous political
actors. They also “facilitate Beijing’s influence operations on the continent” as the data
is used to tailor operations according to the targets.13 It is plausible that Beijing specifically
sought to secure these construction projects, or even fund them entirely, in order to further
its influence operations. At least 40 of the 54 African countries have infrastructure
built by Chinese companies, including Namibia (25 governmental buildings), Angola
(15), Equatorial Guinea (11), Ghana (11), Uganda (11), Sierra Leone (8), Mozambique (7)
and Zambia (7).14

B. Submarine communications cables
Submarine communications cables are responsible for close to 95% of global communications, being faster than satellite communications (40 milliseconds for fiber optic
cables compared to 540 ms. for satellites).15 Along with data centers, these cables are the
backbone of the Internet’s physical layer. As such, they are an important geopolitical
asset.
The map of submarine communication cables reflects the historically advantaged position of the United States and United Kingdom. These two countries remain the two primary communication nodes, despite recent network developments in other parts of the
world. Indeed, the UK is connected to 49 of the existing 265 cables, and ensures nearly
all of the exchanges between Europe and North America.16 And the US is a practically
inescapable communication node, due not only to the density of American connections,

but also the quality of the network. In fact, routers dictate the trajectory of the data based
solely on speed; and given that American network infrastructures are the most proficient,
an enormous amount of data is “diverted” through the US. This occurs even if a “geographically” shorter trajectory is available, for instance, in the case of data transferred from
Europe to Asia.17
Controlling submarine communication cables is an enormous political and strategic asset. It allows those in control to capture information transferred by these cables,
similarly to what the NSA (the “Upstream” program) and the GCHQ (the “Tempora”
program) did, and to cut communications during times of political tensions or armed conflict. During World War I, telegraph cables were used in this manner. Initially developed
as trading tool, telegraph cables were converted into a weapon immediately after the war
began, as British authorities were able to interrupt and cut a significant share of German
communications. At the time, London controlled over three fourths of all telegraph cables,
holding a quasi-monopoly over the use, installment, and upkeep of the cables.18
Given the political stakes, China made submarine cables a priority for the digital Silk
Road. Multiple companies, including Huawei Marine Networks, were encouraged to invest
heavily in the sector. China’s progress in this endeavor has been extremely quick.
Although China owns only 11.4% of existing submarine cables, it owns 24% of cables
under construction. In Asia, 30% of installed cables, as well as more than 50% of cables in
development, are controlled by China. Besides, Huawei “completed a cable stretching nearly
4,000 miles from Brazil to Cameroon. The cable is partly owned by China Unicom.”19
The Chinese authorities want to improve their capacity to capture data transiting
through submarine cables. This will allow them to exert greater pressure in case of
a political or economic conflict, particularly in its neighboring countries. In fact, China’s
investment in submarine cables has strengthened its operational ability to cut the cables
it acquired and it could then turn it against Taiwan. Countries like Taiwan could easily
have their international communication crippled due to Chinese cable domination.20 These
developments are congruent with Beijing’s deployment of an underwater surveillance system aimed at improving submarine detection, notably targeting American submarines in
the South China Sea.21
China’s political expansion and cable capacity development faces serious obstacles. In 2013,
the US government defeated a transatlantic cable project between New York and London in
which Huawei was a stakeholder.22 More recently, Washington’s efforts to slow Huawei’s rise
on 5G led Huawei to sell its shares of Huawei Marine Systems (which owns Huawei Marine
Networks) to another Chinese company, Hengtong Optic-Electric.23 Huawei’s strategy was to
avoid the deceleration of the Chinese penetration in this key market.

II. New technologies
The use of the Chinese digital platforms WeChat, Weibo, and TikTok for data collection is discussed in other sections of the report (→ p. 196). The following section discusses
Beidou, Huawei, and two database companies.

A. Beidou
The navigational system BDS (Beidou Navigation Satellite System), developed by Wuhan
Optics Valley Beidou Holding Group, has been operational since 2012. The development
of BDS added China to the very exclusive group of international powers with global
navigation systems (Global Navigation Satellite Systems, GNSS) to which the US (GPS),
the EU (GALILEO), and Russia (GLONASS) belong. By the end of 2020, the Chinese
company had presumably close to fifty satellites, covering all New Silk Road countries.
This system allows China to penetrate all of these markets.
With Beidou, China has gotten independent from the US-owned GPS system.24 Prior to
the development of Beidou, the US could cut China off from certain zones in case of a
conflict. China in turn could exert the same pressure on any country using the Beidou
system (instead of the GPS). Beidou provides then both autonomy and influence,
a central element in the construction of the digital Silk Road.25 Besides, the Taiwanese
minister of Science and Technology argued that the Beidou system creates a risk of espionage. He explained that the Chinese government could use Beidou to track smartphone
users through embedded malware or navigation signals.26 Currently, it does not appear that
Beidou has the technological ability to do so however.27 Regardless, the “spatial information
corridor,” defined by Beijing, should in fine accelerate the partition of the planet into two
spheres of influence, American and Chinese.28

B. Huawei
Since the arrest of Meng Wanzhou (孟晚舟, the chief financial officer of Huawei and
daughter of CEO Ren Zhengfei 任正非), in Canada at the behest of the US government,
and the retaliatory measures adopted by Beijing (including the arrest of two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor → p. 546), the dispute between the US and
China regarding Huawei has gone public. Beyond a play for power, this conflict has highlighted Beijing’s 5G ambitions, pushing its potential partners around the world to re-evaluate the security risks attached to Huawei.
China made 5G a primary objective in the development of the digital Silk Road, heavily investing in national telecommunication companies. They rapidly propelled China in this
very competitive sector. Among all Chinese companies, Huawei has benefitted the most

from China’s rapid ascension in the telecoms sector. It not only conquered the Chinese
market, but successfully penetrated markets around the world.29 And unlike its main competitors Nokia and Ericsson, who primarily make phones, Huawei is an integrated society, present across the entire value chain. For example, Huawei is Deutsche Telekom,
Vodafone, and Telefonica’s supplier in Europe.30
The Meng Wanzhou affair, and the US oppositional stance vis-à-vis Chinese companies
operating in sensitive sectors, have led to a debate in the West about security risks associated to Huawei and 5G. But concerns about the proximity of Chinese companies with the
CCP’s defense and intelligence apparatuses, and increasingly frequent cases of corporate
espionage, had also paved the way for this debate.
Obviously, the US position does not only stem from a desire to protect its scientific and
industrial property, but also from a desire to slow, or even halt, the rise of Chinese companies in strategic sectors. While this threat can be exaggerated at times, Huawei does raise
security questions for countries that allow the company to build all, or part, of their
5G infrastructure.31
There are multiple security concerns. Is one of them. For example, when the Dutch
telephone operator KPN installed Huawei technology in 2009, despite repeated warnings from the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) about, it asked
Capgemini to conduct a risk analysis. The report produced by the consulting firm found
that Huawei had the ability to listen in on “KPN’s mobile numbers in an unlimited,
uncontrolled and unauthorized manner,” including those of the Prime Minister
and ministers, and had access to the database of all telephone numbers. The report
concluded that “authorities and companies could withdraw their confidence in KPN if
it became public that the Chinese government could tap KPN’s mobile numbers and
paralyze the network.”32 This report remained secret until the Volkskrant newspaper,
which had access to it, reported the findings in April 2021.33 Similarly, in Poland, a former Huawei official was arrested in January 2019: he is accused of being a “Chinese
intelligence officer placed under a commercial cover at Huawei Polska” and to have “provided information to these services that could have been detrimental to the Republic of
Poland.”34
Another concern is the nature of the company and its ties to the PLA’s intelligence
services. Several articles have mentioned the collaboration between Huawei and the PLA,
which dates back to the company’s inception. In fact, Ren Zhengfei presumably contributed to the construction of a network of communication infrastructure during the 1990s.35
This initial contract may have created a privileged relationship between Huawei and the
military. Moreover, the recent military-civil fusion effort has specifically targeted telecommunications. As such, it is highly likely that Huawei is involved in defense programs. In
2013, the Indian Intelligence Bureau (domestic intelligence) affirmed that Huawei and ZTE

were part of the PLA’s 863 Program, which apparently involved Ren Zhengfei in the development of routers and switches. Indian intelligence services were notably concerned about
the possibility of embedded malware China could then exploit during future conflicts.36
Forbes claimed that Huawei worked with Bo Yu Guangzhou Information Technology Co,
considered to be one of the groups of hackers working for the Chinese government.37 The
company was listed in an indictment for attacks on US firms by the US Justice Department.
Huawei never denied its links to Boyusec, but claimed that they simply conducted an evaluation of Huawei systems.
Evidence has already shown that the company, which provides “surveillance systems
for entire cities,” “has knotted a partnership with the police,” in Xinjiang for instance.
Because Huawei signed “a strategic cooperation agreement with the Ministry of Public
Security of Xinjiang,”38 the German researcher Adrian Zenz described “this region [as]
a laboratory for the Police State of the 21st century, to which Huawei closely collaborates.” He thought it probable that “Huawei’s technology had already been used to identify
Uyghur people and to contribute to their internment.” He then concluded that “Huawei
is a strategic tool used by the Chinese state to repress the Uyghurs, and probably a
major Trojan Horse threatening the security of telecommunications elsewhere in
the world.”39
In a July 2019 article, Christopher Balding discussed the intimate ties between Huawei
and the Chinese state security services, seemingly confirming the fears expressed by the
US government and its allies.40 Balding’s research was based on the analysis of the CVs
of Huawei employees, which revealed prior professional affiliation to Chinese intelligence.
While this method is innovative and interesting, 3 CVs are not enough to support Balding’s
conclusion. Even the case of Li Jingguo, who supposedly worked as a representative for the
Ministry of State Security (MSS), cannot confirm extensive ties between the institutions,
nor the instrumentalization of Huawei by the MSS.
In fact, intelligence services have little to gain from establishing a direct control over
Huawei and installing covert agents. The 2017 intelligence law already provided a legal
framework for the government to coerce Chinese companies into collaborating with
its intelligence services. On that note, Huawei hired the law firm Zhong Lun to defend
the company, stating that Beijing can only ask for their assistance in specific and clear
cases of counterespionage.41 Furthermore, they defended that no existing law mandates
Huawei to implant backdoors in IT system, because Chinese law protects the interests
of companies. Finally, they argued that Huawei branches and subsidiaries abroad are not
subjugated to Chinese law. The nature of the Chinese regime severely undercuts
Huawei’s defense: it actually offers no real protection to citizens or companies
against the regime. Rule of law does not exist in China. The system can more accurately be described as what the German doctrine refers to as a police state. Consequently,
it is difficult to imagine Huawei executives refusing a request from the intelligence ser36. Joji Thomas Philip, “NSC points to Huawei, ZTE’s links with Chinese military,” The Economic Times, (15 May

vices. Notable in Huawei’s defense is their law firm’s link to the CCP. Zhang Xuebing, the
managing partner of Zhang Lun law firm, is also the secretary of the Beijing Lawyers’
Association. The law firm made waves after Xi Jinping’s election as it participated in subduing civil liberties defense lawyers.
Furthermore, Christopher Balding and Donald Clarke have questioned Huawei’s
financial structure, highlighting that it was impossible to determine its real owner. Ren
Zhengfei, the official owner, only possesses a fraction of the company. Huawei, whose full
name is Huawei Technologies Inc., is entirely owned by Huawei Investment & Holding,
a much smaller company of about one hundred employees. This holding is co-owned by
the founder Ren Zhengfei (“about 1.01%”) and a CCP-aligned union, called the Huawei
Investment & Holding Company Trade Union Committee (HHTUC), which owns the
remaining 98.99%. According to the two authors, the opaque nature of the system deflects
any attempt to understand the articulation of the respective responsibilities of the different
structures.
Finally, two former managers of Huawei’s Czech branch anonymously reported, to
a local radio, that they were required to enter the information of private client into the
company database, such as number of children, their preferences, and financial situation. The database was managed by the headquarters, and they did not know who could
access it. The collected data was routinely discussed with Chinese embassy officials. Data
regarding top Czech officials was also collected, with some of them subsequently invited
to China.42

Chinese authorities understood long ago that in order to “guide” or “channel” a people– with a quasi-hydrological approach to public opinion,43 it first needed to know
it. Surveillance, through a massive data collection and analysis of habits and individual preferences, is essential in that endeavor. And automated tools are needed, which
leads to a tight link between the control of public opinion and big data technologies in
China, as well as between the Party-State and private companies.44 Initially (and mostly)
a technique to control domestic public opinion, the Chinese authorities are increasingly
using this tactic to shape public opinions abroad. According to Jessica Blake and Mareike
Ohlberg, “the emergence of the public opinion service sector offers a glimpse of what
[Chinese] techno-authoritarianism might actually look like […]: The Party-state’s
use of, and reliance on, private technology companies to manage the volatile interaction
between ideas, speech, and society.”45 An increasing number of studies have focused
on China’s “digital authoritarianism.”46 In this context, Beijing’s use of databases to
feed into and prepare influence operations abroad can be illustrated by the following two
examples.

1. GTCOM
Global Tone Communications Technology Co. Ltd (GTCOM) is a big data and artificial intelligence company affiliated to the Propaganda Department. One of its products “claims to collect 10 terabytes of data per day, or two to three petabytes per year, from
Web pages, forums, Twitter, Facebook, WeChat, and other sources. In terms of size, it is
the equivalent of 20 billion Facebook photos. The company describes its work as directly
contributing to China’s national security, including military intelligence and propaganda,47”
explained Samantha Hoffman, author of an ASPI report on the company.48 GTCOM has
an agreement with Alibaba Cloud, for instance, which uses its translation services and
authorizes GTCOM to collect any data its services generate.

2. OKIDB
A report published in September 2020 provided for the first time “direct evidence of
data collected by China on its monitoring and data collection on foreign individuals and institutions for purposes of intelligence and influence operations.”49 The
authors were able to access the Overseas Key Information Database (OKIDB), a database
created by the company Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co. It contained information on “2.4 million individuals, 650 thousand organizations, 2.3 billion news
articles, and 2.1 billion social media posts.”50 The data was siphoned from a variety of other
databases, including Factiva, as well as social networks, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
and others. China Revival appeared to be using these websites to build personal profiles
that included family relationships and work histories. Additionally, the database contained photographs of the individuals in question. The study estimated that the majority of
the information compiled came from open sources, but around 10% to 20% did not. The
authors believed that “some of the data comes from unauthorized data access such as
hacking.”51 Among the individuals found in the database, many were public sector employees: “everyone from known politicians to political aides to low level military personnel.”52
The database also contained information about the business world, academic and scientific
communities, think tanks, and even organized crime. The common element among them
was that “all are individuals and institutions Chinese security, intelligence, and influence operations are known to be interested in targeting.”53
The database was used for analysis: “designed to assist the Chinese government, security,
and intelligence services, OKIDB adds in multi-layered functionality to help target and link
individuals. Though not extensive, we found analyst notes about certain targets. Certain
indexes had classifiers for individuals or institutions such as importance.”54 It also enabled
the mapping of personal and professional relationships.

OKIDB does not appear to be the only database of this kind. In fact, the authors found
“links in the database [linking] to other databases” and that institutions and individuals
seemed to be classified in separate bases. They affirmed that “the Chinese state is using
OKIDB data,” a fact Shenzhen Zhenhua did not deny. The company admitted having
close ties to the PLA and MSS. It is likely that OKIDB helped these structures plan
their intelligence and influence operations by collecting information on possible
targets. The authors concluded that “the unique blend of civil-military fusion pushed by
China that works with private firms to engage in state policy activities such as intelligence
gathering should be concerning. Foreign individuals and institutions working in sensitive
or influential sectors need to be aware of how China is targeting them for influence operations. China is using a variety of firms and channels to gather data to inform its influence
and intelligence operations.”55

SUMMARY OF THE SECOND PART

Contrary to the prevalent assumption generally made about authoritarian regimes, “China”
is not a unitary actor. In fact, the relative fragmentation of the regime can impact the
nature of its influence operations. These operations are implemented by four major institutional actors: The Party, the state, the army, and the companies.

• Within the Party, there are five main bodies implementing influence operations:
- The Propaganda Department, in charge of ideology, controls all media and the cultural
production in the country. It is a powerful machine that aims to shape the dominant discourse,
control mass media, restrict freedom of speech and critical thought, guide and manipulate
public opinion, defend its interests, justify its actions, and present the state positively. The
Propaganda Department also controls a vast network operating within China and abroad. It
commands a variety of vectors of information and is increasingly aggressive in its data collection efforts.
- The United Front Work Department (UFWD), has twelve offices which reflect its principal
targets: political parties; ethnic minorities; Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan; the private sector economy; non-CCP intellectuals; new social classes; Tibet; Xinjiang; overseas Chinese (two offices); and
religious affairs (two offices as well).
- The International Liaison Department (ILD) engages with foreign political parties,
through “party diplomacy,” with dual objectives. It aims to build a global consensus that
favors Beijing (supporting China’s “friends,” reinforcing its soft power and its discursive
power) and it serves as an analysis and observation platform (and possibly also intelligence
gathering).
- The Chinese Communist Youth League (CYL) is simultaneously a breeding ground
for future Party members, directly funneling the youth into the CCP system and ideology, and
a disposable reserve of manpower (over 80 million members aged 14 to 28). The CYL has its
own propaganda methods, in Chinese and English. It is increasingly present on social media,
where it promotes the Party, glorifies the state, and criticizes the US through humor and sarcasm. The rap group CD Rev is an example of a CYL agent: it is one of the most effective
anti-American discourse tools targeting the Chinese youth around the world. Several examples
of CYL actions demonstrate its ability to manipulate the Chinese population and mobilize the
Chinese youth, particularly those living abroad, with the purpose of contributing to coordinated operations.
- The 610 Office, an entity with presumably around 15,000 members in China and abroad,
operates outside of any legal framework to eradicate the Falun Gong movement. There are 610
Office members in every Chinese diplomatic mission, in charge of detecting, reporting, and persecuting followers of the movement. They are also involved in propaganda activities aimed at dissuading foreign governments of engaging with the followers.

• Within the state, two main structures are involved in influence operations:
- The Ministry of State Security (MSS) is the main civilian intelligence agency. Composed of
17 or 18 divisions, some of them use covers to conduct operations abroad (for instance, the 4th Division uses the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Office of the Bureau of International Cooperation
Chinese Academy of Sciences as a cover).
- The Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) is in charge of propaganda targeting Taiwan. It supervises
multiple media as part of this effort.
• Within the Popular Liberation Army (PLA), which is the military branch of the Party rather than a national army, the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), and
especially the Network Systems Department, has probably inherited the capacities and missions in
the information, cyber, and electromagnetic domains since the 2015 reforms.
PLA Unit 61716 is a key actor also known as the “public opinion warfare, psychological
warfare, and legal warfare unit,” or Base 311. Dedicated to the implementation of the “Three
Warfares” strategy, it centralizes all psychological warfare efforts against Taiwan. Other activities
of the base include research on the US informational environment. The base’s headquarters are
in the city of Fuzhou. It is headed by a duo, a commander and a political commissar. And most
of its members are researchers and engineers specialized in information and communication
technologies, that can be used for public opinion warfare, notably artificial intelligence.
Base 311 also manages front companies like Voice of the Strait (VTS), the China Huayi
Broadcasting Corporation (whose chairman has always been the Base 311 commander), and the
Haifeng publishing house (we believe the director is also a PLA officer) – all branded as civilian
organizations. These companies have the potential to influence people through radio, television,
the Internet, social media, and books. The base supervises other PLA units as well, notably Unit
61070 and Unit 61198 which focus on network communications, psychological warfare and
Taiwan. Finally, the base maintains a close relationship with a nexus of platforms like the China
Association for International Friendly Contact (CAIFC), whose mission is to foster relationships
with foreign elites. Within the base, a training center uses a fake hotel as a cover.
• Private and public companies play a central role in the data collection essential to influence
operations, as it is necessary to know whom to influence, when, and how. There are multiple mechanisms involved in data collection, including espionage, hacking, co-opting regimes, constructing
infrastructures, and setting up new technologies. The Party uses firms for these activities. The
Party-State has implemented different strategies to expand its control over the private sector. The
first is the military-civil fusion aimed at converting innovative technologies into military gains. The
second is Article 7 of the National Intelligence Law, which forces all Chinese companies, private
and public, as well as citizens, to “support, help, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts.”
The following tools are specifically used for data collection:
- Infrastructures, including buildings, were discovered to be data collection tools following
the scandal over the African Union headquarter. Built by a Chinese company, it was filled with
microphones, and its IT system riddled with backdoors, allowing Chinese intelligence services to
absorb all exchanges between staff members. Chinese companies have built or renovated at least
186 government buildings in Africa and created at least 14 sensitive government telecommunication networks, all of which are at risk of similar security breaches. The siphoned information
can be used to recruit potential intelligence assets, coerce leaders, and facilitate Beijing’s influence
operations. Another tool used for Beijing’s influence operations are the submarine communications cables. A priority of the CCP’s digital Silk Road, these cables allow China to increase its
data capturing capacity, expanding its ability to exert pressure over other actors during political or
economic conflicts.
140

- New technologies, including the platforms WeChat, Weibo, and TikTok (discussed in another portion of this report); Beidou, which not only allows China to exert pressure on states who
adopted the navigational system, but also poses espionage risks; and Huawei, an integrated company with a presence across the value chain, which raises concerns because of the nature of the
company and the relationships it may have with the security services and the PLA. Finally, databases offer a glimpse of what researchers refer to as Chinese “techno-authoritarianism” or “digital authoritarianism.” These databases feed and prepare influence operations abroad, as exemplified by
GTCOM (a big data and artificial intelligence company affiliated to the Propaganda Department)
and OKIDB. The latter is a database company that acknowledges its ties to the PLA and MSS. It
created millions of personal profiles detailing the family networks and work histories of individuals
“Chinese” security, intelligence, and influence operations are known to be interested in targeting.”

While not exhaustive, this part is the longest of the report. It shows the number and
diversity of actions undertaken by the Party-State as a part of its influence operations
abroad. They can be classified into two approaches: Beijing attempts to seduce and
subjugate while, at the same time, infiltrate and coerce. These two categories are relevant for analysis and to understand that Chinese influence operations stand on two legs.
Yet, these two categories are often difficult to distinguish in practice; they are far from
mutually exclusive. For example, language and culture are an integral part of the Party’s
seduction efforts, but education in the Confucius Institutes, pressures exerted on the film
industry and on museum are also methods of infiltration and coercion. As such, the distinction we made is debatable and could have been different. More important than the exact
categorization of methods, as many overlap, is to acknowledge the extraordinary diversity
of methods Beijing uses to seduce, subjugate, infiltrate, and coerce.
At first glance, these two approaches are complimentary. In practice, however, the second has clearly become the dominant approach in recent years. This reality is reflected in
the imbalance between the two chapters of this section, the latter being fifteen times longer than the former. This parallels the widespread and globally-shared representation that
China is becoming increasingly aggressive. Beijing’s seduction efforts have not ceased, but
the Party now uses coercion in a systematic and uninhibited manner. We will address this
choice, which may prove counter-productive, in the conclusion (→ p. 638).

Chapter 1

SEDUCE AND SUBJUGATE

The first type of political warfare strategy enacted by the CCP is to seduce foreign populations. Not unlike the United Front, which aims to eliminate Party enemies
by rallying them to its cause, this strategy is built on a positive historical narrative on
China, an ameliorative story-telling of its past and present successes. These narratives
intend to spark sympathy, if not adhesion, to China and its political goals. In certain cases,
they can lead to a complete subjugation (from the Latin jugare which means “attach”) of
the targets of these operations of seduction. Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel JuneauKatsuya explained that “what Chinese strategists understood long ago is that influence is
far more efficient than control. Ultimately, control is the end result of strategically
deployed influence. Rather than launching a frontal attack to gain control over an opponent, it is better to be strategic and patient in order to gain influence over them. […] To do
so, silver-tongued emissaries will initially dangle the benefits of a good relationship, notably
lucrative economic markets and privileged partnerships.”1
The following section will demonstrate the Chinese seduction strategy through four
easily identifiable narratives that highlight intrinsically Chinese qualities, values, or
achievements. They are the “Chinese model,” tradition, benevolence, and power.
These narratives can aim to build a positive image of China (positive strategies2) or to “rectify” erroneous representations on China by debunking negative narratives like the Chinese
threat theory. As demanded by Xi Jinping, it is primordial to “tell China’s story well and let
China’s voice be heard.”3 Not all of these narratives are intended for the same audience, and specific channels target different groups. Some target entire populations and
other specific groups within a population (the Chinese diaspora, the journalist or academic
community, etc.). On rare occasions, these narratives may target one person (a politician,
for instance), or a small number of people.

I. The “Chinese model”
China’s seduction strategy relies on the model it implicitly offers to the world, an alternative to the liberal democracy. The attractiveness of this model rests primordially on
a spectacular economic growth,4 an alleged political and administrative efficiency
(a “Chinese way” of operating that is supposedly more efficient than the endless palavers
of democracies – illustrated by the lightning fast, though controversial, construction of
hospitals in China to deal with Covid-19 patients), and a political system based on meritocracy and the wisdom of its leaders rather than on elections.5
During a congressional hearing, in March 2020,6 Daniel Tobin noted that the CCP should
not be considered a “reactive, defensive, and besieged” archaic organization that is on the
defensive trying to hold together the relics of a communist heritage, and slowly dissipating
after the fall of the Eastern bloc, as it develops a modern capitalist economy. In fact, the
Party’s approach reveals revisionist ambitions. Beyond remaining in power, it seeks to
reconfigure the international order to fit Chinese norms, values, and institutions. It
is on the basis of this literature, as well as the memoirs of party leaders, that Rush Doshi
shows that China is indeed endowed with global ambitions constituting a true grand strategy.7 Jean-Pierre Cabestan notes that China has become the most important revisionist
power in the world.8 This is significantly different from the Kremlin’s approach, explained
Jean-Maurice Ripert, who served as ambassador of France in both countries. He noted that
“China does not believe itself beholden to human rights standards, as defined by the UN’s
1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It advocates for ‘Chinese values’ instead.
Russia, on the other hand, pretends to uphold human rights.”9 “China wants to impose
an alternative international order that can be defined as ‘multi-bilateralism.’ In a word, like
a bicycle wheel, it presents the states act as spokes, leading toward a central point, China!
Officially, China claims to defend multilateralism, but its actions are in direct contradiction
to this claim. They push forth a system where countries define themselves in relation to
China, where juxtaposing these relationships shapes a new international order, founded on
Chinese values.”10 Beijing aspires to fashioning new international order, which it has
the resources to do. Because Moscow is unable to fashion such a new order, it has
opted for a “strategy of chaos.”11 We will address this comparison further in the conclusion (→ p. 620).
4. China experienced an average GDP growth of 9.8% per year for over 30 years. While not unique, this growth is
comparable to that of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. From 1950 to 1980, South Korea experienced an annual GDP
growth of 9.1%, Japan of 7.7%, and Taiwan (between 1960 and 1990) of 8.8%. China’s growth is only slightly better.
Their average annual GDP growth in purchasing power parity is: 11.7% (China, 1978-2004) 11.1% (Japan, 1950-1980)
11.1%, 9.5% (South Korea, 1953-1983) and 12.4% (Taiwan, 1960-1990). The Chinese growth is no exception: it is close
to the overall regional growth.

Since Xi Jinping’s arrival to power, the promotion of this model has been incarnated in
two main concepts: “the Chinese solution” (中国方案) and “the community of common destiny” (人类命运共同体). The former illustrates China’s opposition to Francis
Fukuyama’s famous End of History thesis,12 which was refuted by Xi Jinping during the
Party’s 95th anniversary in 2016: “history never ended.” The Communist Party is confident
it can offer humanity an alternative and better social system – in other words, a substitute
for liberal democratic institutions.13 This was the meaning of the statement made by He
Yiting (何毅亭), vice president of the Central Party School, in May 2020: “Xi Jinping’s
New Era of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is the Marxism of the 21st century
[...] China’s development transcends national geographical boundaries and acquires global
historical significance, meaning that China is qualified to be the ideological and theoretical
pinnacle guiding the innovative development of world Marxism.”14
Then, the “community of common destiny” is based on the idea of a global community conscious of its shared destiny that needs to cooperate to face current challenges. The
concept already had a place in the Party’s rhetoric before Xi Jinping. Hu Jintao referred to
it in his speech at the 18th Party Congress, on November 8, 2012, when he said that it was
necessary to make other countries aware that we are all part of the “community of common destiny.”15 Despite this mention, the concept was not central to Hu’s leadership. Hu
focused more on the concept of a “harmonious society,” respecting the diversity of systems. Xi Jinping subsequently broke from Hu’s vision, using the concept of a “community
of common destiny” to urge the adoption of the Chinese model. Besides, the idea of a
community of common destiny has ties to the Confucian notion of Tianxia (天下- “all-under-heaven”), recently re-popularized by Zhao Tingyang (赵汀阳); it has become a subject
of intense debates within the Chinese academic community. For now, the Party has seldom
used the term however.16
The concept of “community of common destiny” was added to the Party’s statutes in
2017, and in the preamble of the PRC’s constitution in 2018.17 On multiple occasions, Xi
Jinping introduced the subject abroad, such as during his African visit, at the Bo’ao Forum,
and to ASEAN members in 2013, to the 2017 Davos Forum, and to the United Nations. In
2015, the term “destiny” was replaced by “future” in the official English translation in order
to reduce the expansionist character of the formula and thus avoid suspicion from foreign audiences.18 The established English formula thus became the “community of shared
future for mankind,” but the Chinese expression remains unchanged. The rhetorical enterprise thus aims at distorting the liberal vocabulary in favor of the CCP’s vision, as Stella
Chan points out: “the phrase incorporates traditional elements of Chinese foreign policy

that prioritize a state-centered approach to human rights, while subordinating individual
rights to the basic question of national interest.”19
Unlike Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping has a plan to implement his vision: The Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI consists in building platforms and infrastructures
to help create this “community of common destiny.” The propaganda campaign on
behalf of the “community of common destiny” is supported by a plethora of ameliorative
slogans – “win-win” cooperation, “equality among states,” “pacific development,” “prosperity,” “mutual respect,” “friendship between peoples,” and others that foster adhesion to
the concept. The lexical field used to promote the BRI is similar: vague, positive, but
hollow. The BRI is often presented as an innocent and “inclusive” project, seeking “connectivity,” or “cooperation.” The Chinese vision, as represented in the media, is associated
to ideas like the “extended family” or a “global village,” working “hand in hand,” dialogue,
justice, peace, human progress, a rejection of the Cold War mentality, a rejection of hegemonic tendencies, the defense of “small” states, and other appealing ideas.
The first results of a 2020 Google search which included the words “Belt and Road”
and a Chinese media reporting on international news, like the Global Times, China Daily, or
CGTN, illustrates the domination of this positive rhetoric. The articles found are entitled:
the BRI “…best hope for globalization’s rebound,” “…route of life and opportunity,” “…
beacon for gloomy global recovery”; it “…helps build lasting economic and trade relations,” “…boosts cultural exchanges, mutual understanding,” “…brings major benefits to
four continents,” and asks “…Why is it important to Europe?” and “…Why is not the BRI
a strategy of China?”20
This propaganda, diffusing the image of a beneficial-to-all, even altruistic, Chinese
project, has proven fruitful for Beijing. Yet, the Chinese government does not hide its
concrete intention: The Party-State wants to impose a new international order, with
“Chinese characteristics,” that serves its interests. It does not just seek to replace the
US as head of the current international system, but rather to become the leader of a new
and different global order. Beijing is not satisfied with the current global order; it does
not ensure the safety of its political regime nor does it recognize it as its “fair” value. The
Party does not only seek a world order in which its political regime can survive, it seeks a
world order in which its political regime is glorified.21 This is the ambition of the “Chinese
dream” for the “great national renaissance.” Only the creation of the “community of common destiny” could bring this “great national renaissance.”
The “community of common destiny’s” propaganda campaign seeks to convince
other states to adhere to the Chinese model, as an alternative to the Western liberal model. It is presented as a superior, more efficient model that ensures economic
development while preserving political stability. Based on China’s “five millennia of glorious civilization,” nearly “one century of CCP rule,” and “forty years of miraculous
development,” Xi Jinping asserts that China has the legitimacy and capacity to become

the leader of the new world order and to ensure international security.22 In his speech at
the 19th Congress, Xi Jinping defended the argument that “Chinese socialism […] blaz[es]
a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization. It offers a new
option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while
preserving their independence; and it offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to
solving the problems facing mankind.”23
The Chinese congratulate themselves that their concept of a “community of
common destiny” was used verbatim in multiple UN resolutions. They see it as
evidence that Chinese ideas are gaining ground in the international community, which
recognizes China’s position as a responsible world power.24 The UN now considers the
BRI as a project aligned with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. And the
UN secretary general personally promoted the BRI to other member states,25 inciting them to participate. The UN presents the initiative like Chinese propaganda does: a
global development project rather than a Chinese influence strategy looking to build an
international order based on CCP ideals.26 François Godement acknowledged that “even
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, whose mission and mandate is far from
the BRI’s objectives, felt the need to sign a memorandum of action on the BRI with
Beijing.”27
The participation of countries to the BRI and the adoption of the “Chinese solution” by
others – whether or not they are blind to the revisionist Chinese ambitions, sincerely believe
the altruistic propaganda narrative, or are simply not resisting the Chinese expansion –
show the success of the Chinese propaganda campaign. However, during the drafting of
the document celebrating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations in June 2020, the Five
Eyes states and India refused the inclusion of the term “community of destiny” on the
grounds that it would be an expression of CCP ideology.28

II. Tradition
Traditional Chinese culture, which is particularly well perceived in many countries
(a wisdom that is more than a thousand years old, technical and scientific inventions and
innovations, martial arts, graphic arts, ceramics, etc.), is now exploited by the Party. It has
become a central component of the Chinese narrative used to create a positive image of
the country, and of the political party leading it. The promotion of traditional Chinese
medicine abroad, and within international bodies, is a good example of the Party’s narrative strategy to expand its influence.

A. The example of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
The Party initially focused on the recognition, by international organizations, of
the intrinsic value of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This process occurred
relatively quickly. In 2015, TCM was recognized in the medical world for the first time when
Tu Youyou (屠呦呦) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for her research on the role of
the molecule Artemisinin, traditionally present in Chinese herbs, in the fight against malaria.29 When Xi Jinping became president, he initiated two strategies to promote the use of
TCM around the world: obtaining its recognition by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and integrating it into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

1. TCM and the WHO
The Chinese Margaret Chan was director general of the WHO from 2006 to 2017.
During her term, she promoted TCM within the organization. In 2016, she gave a speech
praising Chinese medical advances, and traditional medicine in particular: “by mobilizing
doctors, barefoot doctors, traditional practitioners, sanitary inspectors, and medical personnel in factories, this country, despite its size, eradicated smallpox twenty years before
the rest of the world. […] This feat gave China a reputation within the WHO: China can
accomplish anything it sets out to do.”30
That same year, Xi Jinping forced local governments to praise and promote TCM
within their health care systems.31 The following year, he visited the WHO for the first
time, gifting the organization with a bronze statue representing acupunctural points,32 a
symbol of the Party’s desire to have the traditional practice recognized.
The CCP also took advantage of the Covid-19 crisis to reinforce the legitimacy,
recognition, and upholding the efficiency of TCM abroad. After developing an entire
network of TCM-affiliated hospitals as early as January 2020, to help prevent Covid-19,33
the CCP multiplied declarations on TCM’s efficiency in fighting the disease.34 On March 9,
2020, Yu Yanhong (余艳红), deputy director of the National Administration of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, declared in a press conference that the majority of the 50,000 cured
Covid-19 patients had benefited from a mixture of TCM and Western medicine.35 For
the Chinese administration, this was enough to prove the efficiency of Covid-19. Chinese
teams of TCM experts were also deployed around the world to assist countries affected by
Covid-19.36

The following month, the World Health Assembly (the decision-making body of
the WHO) included TCM in chapter 26 of the organization’s 11th edition of the
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems – ICD, which could be applicable to member countries by 2022.37 The ICD is the main document used by health actors
because it allows them to compare the collection, analysis, and classification of data internationally. China’s influence campaign hence succeeded.
The inclusion of TCM in the ICD was controversial however; many health actors remain
opposed to the decision. Much of the criticism stems from the inconclusive results of
clinical trials, unable to determine the TCM’s efficiency. Some studies even suggested TCM
could be dangerous.38 Many practitioners remain confused as to why the WHO shows
leniency toward TCM (and China in general) (→ p. 213), given its goal of imposing stricter
health regulations. China’s recognition campaign is likely driven by its ambition to place
Chinese actors on a huge global market and use TCM as a vector for Chinese influence. In fact, the development of TCM propagates a noble, wise, and benevolent image
of China.
In May 2020, the Healthy Sciences Authority of Singapore authorized the pharmaceutical laboratory Yiling Pharmaceutical (石家庄以岭药业股份有限公司) to sell its Lianhua
Qingwen capsules as a treatment for Covid-19. Seven other countries have allowed this
treatment on their territory: Canada, Brazil, Thailand, Romania, Indonesia, Ecuador, and
Mozambique.39 These advances can be tied to the international recognition of Chinese university medical diplomas in June 2020. The next step will be the recognition of academic
specializations in the traditional medicine.40
While the promotion of traditional medicine abroad is primarily done through seduction, domestic promotion can be more menacing. In June, a new municipal regulation in
Beijing, pressed by the Party, declared that any defamation of TCM could result in a
lawsuit.41

2. TCM and the BRI
In 2016, Xi Jinping announced a strategy for the development of TCM42 that would
guarantee universal access by 2020, and a flourishing industry by 2030. In addition to the
development of zones of medical tourism, China wants to build at least 30 TCM centers abroad. 17 have already been built in Hungary, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and the UAE.43
China hopes to increase the use and adoption of TCM in health services around the world,

vying for a share of an estimated 50-billion-dollar global market.44 In 2016, $3.42 billion’s worth of TCM products were exported in 183 countries.45
The vast majority of TCM practitioners are trained in China. There are only a handful
of TCM programs in modern medicine universities and hospitals, including in Australia,
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. In France, only one academic institution (Sorbonne
University, in partnership with the Pierre and Marie Curie Medical University) appears to
offer a university diploma in mind-body practices associated with TCM (Diplôme universitaire
des pratiques corps-esprit en médecine traditionnelle chinoise (DUPRAC).46 Other non-degree trainings do exist however.
The campaign promoting TCM in Europe, especially to the European Commission, is
coordinated by the European Traditional Chinese Medicine Association (ETCMA). This
association brings together national actors from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
Poland, Romania, Greece, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, France, Belgium, the UK, and Ireland.47
But the penetration of TCM is most potent in Africa.48 Numerous countries in
Africa have TCM clinics by now. While many patients are Chinese expatriates, local populations are increasingly going to these clinics as well. African states are somewhat favorable
to Chinese TCM investments, some having included TCM in their public health systems.
And multiple TCM material producers are present on the continent.49 The extraordinary
China-Africa Summit on solidarity against Covid-19, which took place online on June
17, 2020, was likely an opportunity for Beijing to further promote tradition medicine in
Africa.50

Although rarely mentioned, and relatively under the radar, TCM is a clear vector for
Chinese influence in the world, supporting the CCP’s overall narrative strategy.

III. Benevolence
Also falling under the category of “seduce and subjugate” are China’s efforts to build
an image as a benevolent power. This new position first led to the reappropriation of
Confucian concepts – after the CCP had scorned the figure of the sage for decades. The
Party now draws its inspirations from the concepts of ren (仁) and shu (恕). Ren is the
affection one feels for one’s fellow man, what Anne Cheng called “the human sense”;51 it is
as much a spontaneous feeling as a moral value which must be cultivated by way of example. Being a model of benevolence would therefore be at the heart of China’s “mission.”
The concept of shu on the other hand refers to an idea of benevolence more “abstract”
and “universal” than ren.52 While some have seen similarities with agape, divine love for
Christians, shu is exempt of any divine dimension and is to be found in the reciprocity of
human relations.53
However, it is not always easy to distinguish in the Chinese strategy what is a sincere belief – that China’s foreign policy is part of a more than millennia-old approach of
benevolence and pacifism toward its neighbors as asserted by Li Anshan (李安山)54 – and
what is a mere rhetoric of covert domination, authoritarian paternalism, and a feeling of civilizational superiority.55

55. The same idea of benevolence animates Chinese leaders and justifies, among certain Chinese and Western
thinkers, a rejection of liberal democracy and a conservative framing of the masses. Charon and Dutournier, “Le
confucianisme, un modèle politique? Une réponse à Daniel A. Bell.”

Beyond the positive image of Confucius and his morality, which the Party tries to
embody, the construction of the image of a benevolent China also serves to discredit the
theory of the “Chinese threat” which hinders the implementation of the Party’s foreign policy. To this end, the Party has promoted counter-narratives emphasizing China’s
absolute pacifism and the harmless and beneficial nature of its growing international footprint: this is particularly the case with the theory of the peaceful rise56 “meant to reassure
Beijing’s partners by encouraging “engagement” strategies.”57
This theory formally became a national strategy with the adoption of white papers
in 200558 and in 2010.59 Proposed in 2003 by Zheng Bijan (郑必坚)60 – an intellectual figure
of the Party that served in numerous structures including the Academy of Social Sciences,
the Central Party School and the Department of Propaganda– this theory maintains that
China is developing peacefully without threatening other powers, without looking for a
territorial expansion, and all of this thanks to its labor and a peaceful international environment. This rhetoric has continued to be employed since Xi Jinping came to power,61 even
though the use of force is now a possible option in the event of a threat against China’s
interests.62 The central idea remains unchanged: to contradict all those who foresee an
inevitable war between China and the United States (the famous “Thucydides trap”63)
and those who see the international system as a zero-sum game – i.e. the rise of China
leading to an inevitable decline of the United States. In its last Defense White Paper, which
is more of a communication tool than a real doctrinal document, China presented itself as
a leader in regional and global security. It also publicized its defense budget in it to prove its
efforts in terms of transparency and explain that all its expenses are justified, which once
again illustrated its desire to display itself as a benevolent and responsible country.64
The Party accompanies this narrative with meaningful actions that aspire to give substance to benevolence. The Peace Ark, also know under the name of Daishan dao (岱山
岛), is one of the most visible symbols of Chinese benevolence manipulated by the
Party.

“Chinese Navy hospital ship Peace Ark (866) departs [U.S. base] Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam [in Hawaii] following the
conclusion of the Rim of the Pacific 2016 military exercises” (U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class
Rebecca Wolfbrandt/RELEASED – public domain).

This hospital ship of the PLA South Sea Fleet naval forces has undertaken a dozen humanitarian missions and cared for around 180,000 patients around the world since its commissioning in 2008. These missions allow China to assume the best intentions and “conquer
the hearts” of local populations who benefit from free health care. Chinese media regularly report on the “achievements” of Peace Ark sailors, for example the Bangladeshi patient
who gave birth to her baby on the ship and decided to name her daughter “Ciin” – “China”
in Bengali – as a tribute to the team which had taken care of her; as for the newborn, she
was quickly erected as “a symbol of the friendship between China and Bangladesh.”65 The
Peace Ark also engages in cultural exchanges with local populations to reinforce the “connections of friendship” between peoples and thus serve as an instrument of public diplomacy to create economic opportunities and enlarge the influence of the country.66 Several
countries, like Fiji and Tonga have praised these missions.67 The Chinese navy’s hospital
ship actually kills three birds with one stone: it not only improve the image of China
(generous, humanitarian) but also discredit local governments (China is helping you
because your government is incompetent) and scout to find out where they can go with
large ships (to potentially military ends).
Finally, China has a development aid program to present itself to the world as a benevolent power. At the 2018 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Xi Jinping promised $60 billion in aid to African countries. The Chinese government reportedly funded
more than three thousand projects between 2000 and 2014, worth more than $270 billion.68
Even if the promises are not always followed by action, and a significant part of the “donations” are actually loans,69 this rhetoric presenting China at the bedside of the developing world allows the Party to portray itself as a benevolent country.

The flagship project contributing to this image is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
whose discourses insists on the isotopies of “sympathy” and “altruism”: the Chinese champion a “win-win” cooperation and propose the idea of a “community of common destiny”
working together for a better future, concepts that are supposed to construct a “Chinese
vision” of international relations.
Hence, the rhetoric of benevolence has been established, in recent years, as a structuring
dimension of the discursive power of China on the international scene.

IV. Power
Seduction cannot only rest on the Chinese “model,” tradition and benevolence. These
qualities make it possible to appeal to a certain part of the international public but they are
not enough to establish its ability to influence actors. This is why Beijing also relies on the
image of power. For the last two decades, we can even say that it has been the main
driving force behind Chinese seduction. In this respect, it is quite significant to note
that the curve for the number of Chinese language learners is very strongly correlated with
that of the development of this image of power: Chinese language learners admit to being
mainly motivated by commercial prospects that they imagine to be monumental.
The Party wants to acquire all of the attributes of power to signify to the world that this
is now China’s status. This strategy is carried out through a narrative, and even more so,
through an image of this power that must, moreover, be variagated; because the Party admits
no weakness, China must be the embodiment of power in all domains. Evidently,
military power,70 which is expressed nowhere better than in the military parades – whose
pageantry is just as good as that of the Soviet Union – an undeniable element but always
liable to disrupt the message of peace and benevolence that the Party wishes to carry. This
is why Beijing also relies on other images of power capable of fascinating without giving
rise to a sentiment of fear.

the communist regime (photo: Xinhua). Right, Beijing National Center for the Performing Arts (photo: Flickr user Hui Lan).

Visually, the image of power is foremostly reflected in architectural achievements. The promotion of the architectural heritage of China –the Great Wall and the
Forbidden City are undoubtedly the best-known symbols in this case – reminds us that,
historically, China has always been a refined and powerful country. And more modern
buildings support the idea that China still is. Situated in the center of the historic capital, the
70. This was a reason the nascent PRC, battered by decades of war, developed one of the most iconic symbols of
power status – nuclear weapons – which, once developed in the 1960s, led to a wave of admiration in the Third World.

Beijing National Center for the Performing Arts, also called “Peking Opera” (国家大剧
院), is a symbol of the modernity of the Chinese power. Designed by the French architect
Paul Andreu, the center is covered by an elliptically shaped titanium and glass dome, which
appears to be delicately laid on water formed by the artificial lake that surrounds it.
Many other architectural projects have been showcased for their beauty, their originality or their technological feats, and they are used by the media as symbols of the Chinese
power. These include the Beijing National Stadium (北京国家体育场) – nicknamed “the
Bird’s Nest” (鸟巢) – built for the 2008 Olympic Games, the CCTV headquarters with
its unusual shape, the Huoshenshan hospital in Wuhan built in ten days to cope with the
Covid-19 pandemic,71 or even the many skyscrapers that have multiplied in the country; five
of them are among the ten highest buildings in the world. 72
China also promotes its scientific and technological achievements, some of which
are visually striking and conducive to media coverage. This is the case for example of the
spherical radio telescope with an opening of 500 meters that was built in a crevasse in Wuxi,
in Jiangsui, which is the largest of its kind, the most sensitive in the world and whose aerial
photos have quickly spread around the planet.73 The many transport infrastructures that
have broken records are also easy to “publicize”: the bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macao
and Zhuhai (Guangdong province), which is the longest maritime bridge in the world;74 the
Beipanjiang Bridge in Guizhou province which crosses the highest precipice (565 meters);75
the railway line that connects the Tibetan plateau to the rest of China, while breaking
altitude records (4,500 meters);76 or the Fuxing bullet train77 and the magnetic levitation
“Shanghai Transrapid” (Maglev), which are among the fastest trains in the world.
Achievements in the space sector are also widely publicized to
reinforce the image of a technologically advanced China and to stir
up feelings of national pride. To name a few recent examples, China
was the first to put a quantum satellite, the Micius, into orbit in
2016;78 the first to successfully land an exploration module, the
Chang’e-4, on the far side of the moon in 2019;79 it finalized its
global coverage satellite positioning system, BeiDou, a competitor to
American GPS and Galileo in 2020 (→ p. 135);80 in July 2020 it sent
its first probe to Mars, Tianwen-1, which, if successful, would be the first mission to achieve
this feat.81 As the image of power is synonymous with cutting edge technologies,

China wants to be the leader in this sector and is proud, among other things, of having
developed the Taihu Light, the fastest super-calculator in the word when it was commissioned in 2016, in Wuxi (Jiangsu). Still very well-ranked today, despite the lead taken by the
Americans and the Japanese, China has the clear intention of reclaiming first place in this
ranking.82
Finally, China looks to host world-class events to showcase its power, such as the
Olympic Gamesit organized in 2008, or the Winter Olympics that it will host in 2022, the
World Exhibition held in Shanghai in 2010, and the G20 summit, which it held for the first
time in 2016 in Hangzhou.
Sometimes, the Party does not hesitate to take credit for innovations which were
actually developed elsewhere. The spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs launched a campaign in September 2020 to highlight China’s inventiveness. As part
of the campaign, they presented four “new inventions”: self-service bicycles, high-speed
trains, online shopping and mobile payment. However, as several accounts on Twitter have
pointed out, all of these inventions were created outside of China: the self-service bicycle
in the Netherlands in 1965, the high-speed train saw its beginnings in Germany before it
boomed in Japan, online shopping is an American invention, while mobile payment originated in Kenya with its M-Pesa system.

Chapter 2

INFILTRATE AND COERCE

The first category of operations focuses on discursive strategies that rely on the production and dissemination of positive narratives about China, in order to shape foreign
perceptions and eliminate potential threats to the Party. This first category is not mere
propaganda, but is already part of the repertoire of active measures (→ p. 33). As we have
seen, these speeches are not only disseminated by the Party’s own means, but also through
local intermediaries who act as propaganda “whitewashers,” masking the true source of the
narrative.1 What also characterizes the operations in the first category is that they call for
voluntary local support, whose motivations are not always altruistic.
The second category consists of “stronger” operations that do not try to seduce the
adversary, but rather, to make it bend. Two types of tools must be distinguished in this
category: infiltration and coercion. To infiltrate (from the Latin filtrum, “filter”) refers to
the idea of “gradually penetrating” a society or a government to influence decision-making
mechanisms. To coerce (from the Latin constringere which means “tighten with” or “tighten
against”) is to impose something on someone against their will, through the use of threats,
intimidation, blackmail, or other forms of pressure.
In the first case, these are infiltration operations which aim to slowly penetrate adverse
societies in order to hinder any possible action against the Party’s interest. These operations
take extremely varied forms according to the nature of the “threat” and are deployed simultaneously in several sectors in order to circumscribe the targets: diasporas, media outlets,
diplomacy, the economy, politics, education, think tanks, culture, and so on.
In the second case, we speak of “punitive”2 or “coercive”3 diplomacy. Originally, the
CCP used it only to defend its fundamental interests (核心利益). Yang Jiechi (杨洁篪),
China’s foreign policy coordinator, recalled that, for the CCP this notion included “issues
concerning Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang.”4 On these subjects the Party does not
tolerate any interference and will draw from the repertoire of coercive diplomatic actions
to prevent a state from maintaining relations of any kind with Taiwan or to prohibit a head
1. Some authors consider that the dissemination of misleading information falls within the scope of active
measures, but we, for our part, consider that the element of concealment or, at the very least, of obfuscation on the
part of the sponsor is an essential dimension that makes it possible to distinguish propaganda from active measures.

3. On the concept of coercion (discussed in the field of international relations since Thomas Schelling, Arms and
Influence (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1966)). See the synthesis: Charles-Philippe David and Olivier Schmitt, La
guerre et la paix. Approches et enjeux de la sécurité et de la stratégie (Paris: Presses de Sciences Po, 2020), 136-150. The concept
of “coercive diplomacy” was theorized in: Alexander George, Forceful Persuasion: Coercive Diplomacy as an Alternative
to War (Washington DC: US Institute of Peace Press, 1991). It was often applied to China, for example by: Fergus
Hanson, Emilia Currey, and Tracy Beattie, The Chinese Communist Party’s coercive diplomacy, ASPI, Policy Brief, Report 36
(2020).

of state from receiving the Dalai Lama. But, gradually, the CCP has broadened the
scope of coercive diplomacy beyond its core interests, to include claims in the South
China Sea or the attainment of market economy status for instance. In recent years, coercive diplomacy has been directed at an increasing number and variety of issues, so much
so that a simple speech that could be interpreted as the beginning of a criticism and as a
public questioning of China’s behavior, or as even the recognition of the talent of an artist
not endorsed by the Party, could lead to a surge of coercive measures in order to bring the
offender back in line with the CCP’s interests.
The Party’s use of these coercive means seems to be largely accepted by Chinese experts
in international relations. For instance, Fergus Hanson, Emilia Currey, and Tracy Beattie
mentionned Jian Jisong (简基松), a specialist in international law at Zhongnan University
(中 南大学)5 who supports China’s unilateral sanctions, or the CICIR, a think tank of the
MSS – because they all defend the implementation of Chinese economic sanctions against
anyone who threatens its interests.6 State media accept and help diffuse this policy of systematic sanctions; hoping to establish a form of deterrence, as illustrated by the reaction of
the Global Times’ editor-in-chief to a call of some British MPs to boycott the 2022 Winter
Olympics in Beijing (see screenshot below).7

O’Brien, David R. Stilwell, Matthew Pottinger, Alex M. Azar II, Keith J. Krach, Kelly D. K.
Craft John R. Bolton and Stephen K. Bannon). These “anti-Chinese American politicians”
were accused of having “seriously violated the country’s sovereignty” and were deemed
“responsible for a series of foolish American actions on issues related to China.”8 They
and their immediate family members are now prohibited from entering Chinese territories
and doing business with China. The announcement of these sanctions in the midst of
Washington’s political transition is a way for Beijing to kill two birds with one stone: punish the Trump administration and warn the Biden administration. It sent a message
to the new U.S. president’s entourage that those who pursue anti-CCP policies will have a
hard time being recruited by U.S. businesses when they leave the administration (as most
of them have interests in China). Here, Beijing skillfully exploited the vulnerabilities of the
U.S. revolving doors system.
If the scope has worryingly widened, as a number of states have recently realized, Evan
Feigenbaum noted nevertheless that the CCP has not yet established a hierarchy in its
response that would specify the actions likely to be taken, from the most limited to the most
coercive.9 The type of response that Beijing will use remains thus relatively uncertain, even
if experience seems to show an increasingly multifaceted use of coercion. The Party
adapts its response to the local reality by identifying the weaknesses of target countries. The
vagueness maintained by Beijing could stem from a hesitation over the approach or from
the desire to dissuade its opponents from any action, as the nature of the Chinese reaction
remains unknown to them. The idea being that more is often achieved when the threshold of intolerance is not clearly defined.
One of the most evident manifestations of coercion is retaliation, which Beijing practices extensively as we will see in this chapter and in the case studies. States, companies,
and individuals who criticize or oppose the CCP are targeted by all kinds of diplomatic
or trade sanctions (such as those currently imposed on Australia): expulsions from the
Chinese market, including some targeting artists (Beijing canceled contracts with South
Korean actors and singers as a retaliation against the THAAD) and cultural products (radio
stations in Beijing have been ordered to stop broadcasting Swedish music). Imposing a
financial cost can also be accomplished by reducing the number of Chinese tourists and
students on which some countries depend (→ p. 405 and 271), or by refraining from broadcasting NBA games to punish one of its leaders for his critical comments (→ p. 250), for
example. It can also mean legal actions (lawfare → p. 53); refusing visas (some Swedes
who were refused Chinese visas were told that it was because of Stockholm’s attitude, for
which China demanded a change); the disclosure of personal data to assist in the online
harassment of certain people (notably pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong → p. 397);
cyber-attacks, intimidation, even physical attacks and kidnappings (Beijing, like some pariah
states, practices a “hostage diplomacy” → p. 411), etc.
The CCP uses an incredibly wide range of retaliatory measures, in all domains
and against all actors. An ASPI report studying 152 cases that affected 27 countries as
well as the EU between 2010 and 2020, noted “a sharp escalation in these tactics since
2018.”10

In any case, whether to infiltrate or coerce, we will see in the following pages that the
Party-State usually goes through a nexus of intermediaries – individuals, associations, companies, institutions, and various organizations. These connections are generally based on
“secrecy, compartmentalization, and deniability,” an approach that has several advantages as Matt Schrader reminded us: not only are the intermediaries force multipliers but the
fact that the relationship with the Party-State is not often assumed – that they may “plausibly deny” it – contributes to “obscure[ing] the Party’s objectives” to “generat[ing]
uncertainty about the extent of party influence,” making it difficult or impossible to
“establish proof required for enforcement of actions” against such practices, and
this ambiguity also contributes to “erod[ing] social trust in target societies.” 11

I. The Diasporas
According to the official Chinese media, there are between 40 and more than 60 million
“overseas Chinese” (海外华人, OCs).12-13 The estimate contrasts with that of the U.S.
Census Bureau (nearly 10 million).14 In fact, it all depends on the reach given to the term,
whether it refers to citizenship or, as Beijing does, descent. In any case, according to a U.N.
estimate, the number presumably doubled between 1990 and 2017.15 They have settled in
around 180 countries, and more than 80% of these “Chinese” have taken the citizenship
of their host country.16
Overseas Chinese, the overwhelming majority of whom live in countries freer than
China, have the particularity of having access to many uncensored sources of information. They are thus constantly exposed to criticism of the CCP, and even to the outright
hostility of certain communities, including the famous “five poisons” and certain foreign
governments. From Beijing’s point of view, this population is a danger because, on
the one hand, it is harder to reach and more exposed to negative influence and, on
the other, it is likely to return to China or simply communicate with (and thus influence) relatives who remain in China. It is therefore logically one of its priority targets in
its influence efforts. The objective of the Party is twofold: to control these diasporas
so that they do not represent a threat to the ruling power, but also to mobilize them
to serve its interests.

A. Ethnic Nationalism
In its broadest definition, the Chinese diasporas – the plural is justified given their heterogeneity – are composed of the Huaqiao (华侨) i.e. Chinese nationals (Hong Kong,
Macanese and Taiwanese nationals are included from Beijing’s point of view) who live or
stay abroad; the Huaren (华人), who have abandoned their Chinese passport and obtained
the nationality of their country of residence; and the Huayi (华裔), the descendants of
Chinese born abroad.17 From Beijing’s point of view, all are “Chinese” “sons and daughters
of the motherland,” regardless of their citizenship status.18 Originally, Beijing drew a relatively clear distinction between them, particularly the Huaqiao and the Huaren, but – “especially under Xi Jinping’s vision of the “one big China Family” and his project of a great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” – the line of demarcation has tended to become more
blurry.19

12. “Premier Calls on Overseas Chinese to Contribute to Economy,” Xinhua (6 Jul. 2015).
13. Since China does not have overseas territories, it is preferable to speak of overseas Chinese (OCs) to refer to
Chinese residing abroad or of Chinese descent. One could speak of “foreign Chinese” but this would not be a literal
translation of the Chinese term. On this point, see the work of Pierre Trolliet in particular.

The goal is to blur the line between Chinese nationals and overseas Chinese and
to create and maintain a sense of belonging to the same nation by homogenizing
very heterogeneous communities, including in their relation with China, since a large
part of these “Chinese” claimed by Beijing are dissidents who fled the regime, particularly
after Tian’anmen, who come from elsewhere (Hong Kong or Taiwan), or who are the
descendants of immigrants. Sometimes they no longer have any ties to the country, the language, or the culture of their ancestors. But it is by mixing as much as possible these diverse
trajectories that Beijing tries to establish – or even artificially manufactures – a “Chinese
community” in a given country to generate a sense of pro-Chinese identity. Most of the
time, this creates a significant gap in perception between the way Beijing sees “the” Chinese
community in Thailand, for example, or in Canada, and the Chinese Thai and Chinese
Canadians who do not feel that they belong to a defined Chinese community. This can lead
to odd situations, such as that anecdote reported by a Chinese-American member of the
U.S. Air Force. During a banquet with a Chinese delegation, he was toasted by the head of
the delegation, a senior general in the PLA air force, who invited him to “remember that
blood is thicker than water. Chinese blood runs through you. You understand us, and know
that no matter what flag you wear on your shoulders, you are Chinese first and foremost.”20
This episode is a reminder that the most likely targets of Chinese influence operations,
whether based on seduction or coercion, are first and foremost those who are considered by Beijing to be ethnically Chinese. The experts at the RAND Corporation, in
a report commissioned by the U.S. Air Force, are therefore right to believe that “one of
China’s first targets of disinformation on social media will be ethnic Chinese U.S. military
officers and service members” – not only on social networks but also in the physical world,
through various means.21
This vision based on “blood” is symptomatic of the fact that the Chinese foreign policy,
especially its actions against those considered as “overseas Chinese”, is first and foremost an
identity policy, and an ethnic nationalism which is also reflected in the integration of the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) into the United Front Work Department in 2018
(→ p. 168), and in initiatives such as the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations in
Beijing in May 2019.22

B. The largest campaign of transnational repression in the world
The first priority for the Party-State is to ensure that these diasporas – which by definition include many dissidents and opponents who have fled China, or simply people
who grew up in a liberal environment critical of the Chinese communist regime – do not
pose a threat. Its main targets in this regard are ethnic and religious minorities, particularly
Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongols (from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) and Falun
Gong followers, but also Taiwanese independence fighters, political opponents, and pro-democracy activists, including Hong Kong nationals (who, since 2019, have been the focus of
particular attention), human rights defenders, journalists, and former officials wanted for

“corruption.” Against these categories of “overseas Chinese,” Beijing is deploying a campaign of transnational repression which, according to the NGO Freedom House,
is “the most sophisticated, global and comprehensive campaign of transnational
repression in the world.”23 Concretely, it includes monitoring these communities and
individuals, regardless of their citizenship (since the Party-State has an ethnic approach),
to identify and infiltrate them, maintain constant pressure on them, intimidate,
threaten, harass, and coerce them, one way or another, or even to physically assault
them (no less than 214 cases recorded by Freedom House between 2014 and 2020). It also
involves putting pressure on the states where they reside to have them arrested and possibly extradited (which happened in India, Thailand, Serbia, Malaysia, Egypt, Kazakhstan,
UAE, Turkey and Nepal at least).24
The case studies in Part 4, particularly Sweden (→ p. 521) and Canada (→ p. 539) provide specific examples of the tactics employed, which range from death threats, or rape,
to physical assault, and include cyber-attacks, pressures on family or relatives still in China,
travel restrictions (confiscated passports, revoked visas), surveillance, searches, harassment
campaigns on social networks, and so on.

Women victims of particularly virulent hate campaigns
A somewhat visible voice that is critical of the Party is systematically targeted by a more-or-less
organized campaign of hatred. Those “ethnically” Chinese, whatever their citizenship, suffer
from attacks all the more violent as they are perceived as “traitors.” Among them, women are
subjected to particularly violent insults.
Vicky Xu, an Australian journalist of Chinese origin, has been the subject of an online harassment campaign since she published an ASPI report on the repression of the Uyghurs in
March 2020.25 Insulted daily on social networks, she has been called “a race traitor,” “a female Han traitor,” “a female demon,” and “a slut”26 “bewitched by the anti-China forces in
the West,” according to the Global Times, which quoted one of her alleged former classmates
at the University of Melbourne (describing her as “a person who pursues personal interests by
selling out her own country”).27 A video uploaded on YouTube – but deleted since – speculated on her obviously-unrestrained sexual life28 (that she presumably “has sex simultaneously
with 15 men and doesn’t pay”29). She received death threats (an Internet user insisted on the
need to “kill a traitor”30), while some of her colleagues received rape threats and others were
detained and interrogated in China.31
Tzu-I Chuang, the Taiwanese wife of an American diplomat (a consul general at Chengdu)
was also targeted by a campaign of online hatred in July 2020. For instance, one social network
user mentioned her 7- and 9-year-old sons: “I hope your two little dogs get bitten to
death and knocked down by a car.” Trolls have released pictures of her home in Maryland
(where the family was repatriated due to the Covid-19 crisis), of her family and herself to
ridicule them. Several pro-Beijing Taiwanese and Hong Kong newspapers published articles
hypothesizing that she was a prostitute paid by the Taiwanese government to harvest

intelligence on American diplomats. Furthermore, Chinese media, such as the Global Times and
the Hubei Daily – but also the CYL – were involved and amplified the campaign as it lasted for
months. She eventually stopped leaving her house and thought about committing suicide.32
The reader can find additional examples in this report, such as the case of Sheng Xue, a
Canadian activist targeted by a similar campaign which delved into speculations on her sexual
life and led to the publication of doctored images of her on Twitter (→ p. 551). These
sexist and mysoginistic attacks against foreign personalities echo the way feminist activists are
treated in China.33 This structural problem is well-summed up by the journalist Shen Lu in the

Diasporas are not only a potential threat to the Party-State: they are also an opportunity, a powerful relay to defend its interests around the world. As such, various actors are
in charge of “diasporic affairs” (华侨事务 工作), including the former Overseas Chinese
Affairs Office (OCAO), which now reports to the UFWD, but also the ministries of Foreign
Affairs, Education, and State Security.
Chinese diasporas can bring many benefits to the Party. Located abroad, OCs can serve
as promoters of Chinese soft power: they are in the best position to disseminate the
Chinese culture to the communities whose codes they have adopted. They can play
the role of a “vanguard” or at least a “bridge” between China and their countries of residence to improve mutual understanding and even promote the PRC’s diplomatic and economic objectives.34 The PRC can also benefit from their knowledge of their countries
of residence to better understand the local political systems and decipher current events.35
This is all the more feasible as OCs are increasingly able to secure a high social status in
their respective countries in various fields such as trade, scientific research, and politics.
However, more than mere facilitators of exchanges between China and other countries,
OCs can be instrumentalized by the PRC for political purposes to influence their

local political life. This is thus a form of interference. In a book based on his PhD thesis
on extraterritorial policies toward OCs, James Jiann Hua To cited, for example, the case of
the unofficial protection of the PLA granted by Beijing to members of the Chinese diaspora in the United States for their commercial interests, in exchange for channeling funds
for Democratic Party election campaigns during the Clinton era.36 The investigation into
illegal and improper activities in connection with the 1996 federal election by the Senate
Committee on Governmental Affairs identified at least six individuals involved in these
donations who allegedly had some direct connection with the PRC, including John Huang,
Maria Hsia and Yah Lin “Charlie” Trie.37 The PRC can also organize, notably through
United Front organizations, the mobilizations of OCs in support of China’s interests, such
as what the Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China (CPPRC,
中国和平统一促进会) does on behalf of the reunification with Taiwan (→ p. 124), or
to protest against topics that anger Beijing, such as the Dalai Lama’s visits abroad, for
which the Chinese Students and Scholars Associations (CSSAs, 中国学生学者联合会)
have repeatedly mobilized Chinese students (→ p. 280).38 To hinder a rally in support of
Hong Kong, on August 23, 2019, the Chinese Embassy in Lithuania, in coordination with
the Chinese intelligence services, organized a counter-demonstration in Vilnius; a majority
of the participants were members of the Association of Chinese Expatriates in Lithuania.39

Chinese embassy involved in counter-protests in Lithuania
On August 23, 2019, as hundreds of Lithuanians formed a human chain in solidarity with the
Hong Kong protesters (several tens of thousands of people were doing the same thing at the
same time in Hong Kong), pro-Beijing activists burst in and disrupted the chain by shouting
“Hong Kong is part of China.” The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry established that “the staff
of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China were involved in organizing the unlawful actions undertaken by the Chinese citizens during this incident.” The ambassador
himself, Shen Zhifei (申知非), was seen at the protest, where he was observing and “directing” the counter-protesters. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also said to be relying information from the Department of State Security regarding “the role the PRC Embassy performed
in the organization, or coordination of the counterprotest.”40 It would be a first example of
Chinese interference in a demonstration in Lithuania.

In countries where OCs also represent a significant portion of the electorate, managing
to influence them to vote for candidates who are favored by the Party is another form
of interference.41 A study of OC participation in U.S. elections produced by the OCAO

in 2004 called for the development of a Chinese voting bloc and support for Chinese candidates running for office.42 In 2015 the Globe and Mail reported that, since 2010, Canadian
intelligence services have been concerned about the Chinese government’s influence on
Michael Chan, Ontario’s Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, who immigrated to
Canada at age 18, and who had presented himself as wanting to serve as a “bridge” between
the two countries, having not forgotten his origins (→ p. 557).43 In 2017, the election of
two Italian deputies of Chinese origins, but perfectly integrated into the local political culture, was celebrated by the Chinese media as a “victory for China’s participation in Italian
political life.”44
In order to persuade the diaspora and push it into action, the Party uses more or less
“soft”45 methods of cooptation. Sometimes it is enough to appeal to the sense of
national or ethnic pride, of love for the motherland to seduce some of them, including those who have abandoned their Chinese passport and those who never had it. The
“diplomacy of assistance” consists in assisting the Huaren and Huayi as much as the
Huaqiao. The PRC has adopted this approach particularly since the 1998 riots in Indonesia
that claimed the lives of over a thousand ethnically Chinese people.46 This diplomacy aims
to maintain a sense of belonging to the same nation across all members of the diaspora.
Scholarships to come and study in China, exchange programs with high schools
and universities abroad, but also all “back to your roots” summer camps (寻根之
旅), open to all Huayi, show that the PRC is ready to invest in the long term to build this
sense of belonging into the future generations.47
Religion is another powerful vector of influence on the diaspora, many members of
which have converted to Christianity.48 The PRC seeks to infiltrate these religious groups to
influence and mobilize OCs who are more likely to be receptive in these circles of sociability.49 Financial incentive-such as the promise of a job or a house-is obviously another
lever used to persuade, as are intimidations and even threats.50 For example, MSS agents
have reportedly forced OCs to cooperate by threatening not to grant or renew visas, to
attack their relatives residing in China, or to consider them subjects of Chinese law even if
they hold a passport of another nationality.51
Beijing also knows how to use traditional media to reach Chinese diasporas. In France,
the embassy uses the Mandarin TV channel, which is a real source of transmission for the
Party’s official discourse toward the Chinese diaspora in France. On March 14, 2020, for
example, the Chinese ambassador in Paris, Lu Shaye (→ p. 235) spoke on the channel and
accused the French media of malice and of using “propaganda” methods to inflict “real
brainwashing” on public opinion. The ambassador criticized the biased treatment by the
French media of the coronavirus crisis in China.52

In France, the Association pour la paix et la réunification de la Chine (Association
for the Promotion of China’s Peaceful Reunification (法国中国和平统 一促进会)) plays
a leading role. It was established on July 5, 2000 by the Association of Chinese Residents
in France.53 It is now headed by Wang Jiaqing (王加清), its executive director, and by Yang
Ming (杨明), its president. As the organizer of the promotional association, Yang Ming
lent his business premises for the inaugural festivities: 78 associations were invited.54 The
purpose of the Association is to unite all Chinese throughout the world who support the
reunification of China and oppose the independence of Taiwan.55 To this end, it organizes
seminars and visits that showcase the Chinese culture.56 It also maintains important links
with other Franco-Chinese associations. Ultimately, it is supervised by the Chinese Embassy
in France, the consular department, and by the Chinese Council for the Promotion of
Peaceful Reunification (中国和平统一促进会), which is its parent association.57
The mobilization of the Chinese diaspora in France was completed by the creation, on
July 14, 2020, of the Association of Chinese Writers in France (AECF), whose stated goal
is to “coordinate activities between members and associated institutions and to promote
the development of literary activities; to develop exchanges between Chinese and French
literary circles.”58 The association, based in L’Haÿ-les-Roses, is chaired by Liang Yuanfa (梁
源法), also known as François Leung (pictured below).59 Liang is the former editor-in-chief
of the daily News of Europe (欧洲时报), which belongs to the Guang Hua Media Group
based in nearby Gentilly (→ p. 171). The association’s board presumably also include Wu
Qin, general manager of Hipotel, a group of 17 hotels in Paris, and president of the FranceChina Shenzhen Association, as well as Huang Guanjie and Tang Tiehua, respectively journalist for News of Europe and cameraman for Phoenix TV.60

II. The Media
“To shape media content and narratives around the world, affecting every region and
multiple languages,” Beijing uses a combination of “widely accepted forms of public diplomacy with more covert, corrupt, and coercive activities that undermine democratic norms,
reduce national sovereignty, weaken the financial sustainability of independent media, and
violate the laws of some countries,” wrote Freedom House.61
Since the mid-2000s, the Chinese authorities have been trying to raise the profile of
some of their “news” organizations to the level of the largest international media with a
global influence, in order to make the Chinese vision of current affairs heard. The turning point came in 2008: as it noted the uncontrolled communication around the Beijing
Olympic Games, which “just as much served as a sounding board for the regime’s opponents,” Beijing drafted a ten-year plan to better control its image in the world and, to
this end, invested “10 billion RMB (€1.3 billion per year).”62 Over the past decade, the
CCP has thus made unprecedented efforts to establish “a new world media order,” to use
the expression coined by Li Congjun, the former president of Xinhua and now a member
of the Party’s Central Committee.63 RSF noted that, “in his speeches, Li Congjun (李从军)
constantly uses such terms as ‘media industry’ and ‘mass communications’ but has never
used the word ‘journalism.’ This is not insignificant. By treating the media as an industry
whose mission is to exercise influence on the state’s behalf, his ‘new world media order’
abolishes the watchdog role the media are meant to play.”64 Indeed, official press releases
mention “media workers” rather than “journalists” – including, which is telling of this
paradox, for the members of the All-China Journalists Association (ACJA).65
The Xinhua news agency, the CCTV television network, the China Daily newspaper,
the Global Times and China Radio International (CRI) are among the first media organizations to have benefited from government support for their international development. In
February 2016, after visiting the three main Chinese media organizations in Beijing (People’s
Daily, Xinhua, and CCTV), Xi Jinping chaired a symposium of around 180 representatives
of state media who were instructed to strictly follow the CCP’s instructions and focus on
the “positive coverage” of the country. “All news media run by the party must work to
speak for the party’s will and its propositions, and protect the party’s authority and unity,”
he declared.66

These major outlets have gradually multiplied their foreign-language content, developed
branches abroad, established partnerships with foreign media and recruited local journalists
to better convey their message to different audiences. As such, Chinese media greatly
benefit from the asymmetry that characterizes the relationship between an autocracy and democracies, as RSF reminded us: “The values of tolerance and openness that
characterize liberal democracies give Beijing considerable freedom of movement, for which
nothing is demanded in return. The asymmetry is striking. The state news agency Xinhua
plans to have opened 200 bureaux around the world by 2020 but Beijing is extremely sparing in the accreditations it gives to foreign reporters. State-owned China Global Television
Network (CGTN) is extending its influence in more than 100 countries but international
TV channels and radio stations such as France’s TV5, America’s VOA and the UK’s BBC
are banned in China outside luxury hotels.”68
In addition to using these major media outlets to project itself in the world, Beijing
is influencing local media in a growing number of countries, starting with those hosting the largest diasporas, with tactics that have long been well-known. In the American case,
for example, it was found as early as in 2001 that “[four] main tactics characterize the Chinese
government’s effort to influence Chinese media in America. First is the attempt to directly control newspapers, television stations, and radio stations through complete ownership or owning
major shares. Second is the government’s use of economic ties to influence independent media
who have business relations with China. This leverage has had major effects on the content
of broadcasting and publishing, effectively removing all material deemed “unfavorable” by
the Chinese government. Third is the purchasing of broadcast time and advertising space (or
more) from existing independent media. Closely related to this is the government’s providing
free, ready-to-go programming and content. Fourth is the deployment of government personnel to work in independent media, achieving influence from within their ranks.”69

A. Chinese mainstream media
Efforts over the past decade to strengthen the capacity and overseas presence of official state media have paid off: CGTN, CCTV, China Daily, People’s Daily, China Radio
International (CRI), Xinhua and China News Service have a global presence, in multiple
languages, and on multiple continents. CRI has more than 70 stations in 65 languages
and is the majority shareholder of 33 other stations in 14 countries; CGTN has 10,000
employees in 70 offices and broadcasts in 140 countries; China Daily claims to have a circulation of 900,000 and a readership of 150 million; Xinhua has 230 offices in the world (a
40%-increase since 2017);70 the agency communicates in 19 languages71 and has increased
its spending in the United States tenfold between 2009 ($500,000) and 2019 ($5 million).72
Since 2018, several of these major media outlets have been combined into a conglomerate,
the China Media Group (CMG), nicknamed “Voice of China” and subordinate to the State
Council. CMG will soon open an “imposing office” in Brussels, in addition to the eight
others it already has elsewhere in the world, and in December 2020, the group advertised
264 new positions, 82 of which are dedicated to “international propaganda.”73
These media’s approach for their international development is always the same: the diffusion of their products abroad is facilitated by the establishment of local offices and the
recruitment of local journalists, the content is calibrated to local news, communication formats (text, image, video, audio) and media (paper, radio, television, Internet) are
diversified, with an emphasis on the presence on social networks and formats adapted
to cell phone screens in order to reach a wider audience, more directly. The website “China
Internet Information Center” (china.com.cn or china.org.cn) is an example of a platform
specifically dedicated to an international audience seeking to establish itself as a reference
news website on China.
Chinese media have difficulties generating as much appeal as mainstream Western media
however. Many viewers, listeners, and readers of foreign-language content are Chinese
who wish to improve their English. Despite the efforts made to rebrand and to promote
themselves as independent media, the lack of credibility of the information presented
and the propagandistic tone of the Chinese media undoubtedly play a key role in
their difficulties to compete with Western media and to establish themselves on the
global market.

Xinhua is one of the largest news agencies in the world. Based in Beijing, it manages
more than 30 national branches and some 180 overseas offices in more than 100 countries.
It is one of the Party’s largest and oldest news agencies. Created in 1931 under the name
“Red China News Agency” (红色中华通讯社), it changed its name to Xinhua in 1937,
which is literally “New China.” Its first foreign broadcast of an English program dates back

to 1944 and the establishment of its first overseas branch in 1948. Today, Xinhua covers
Asia, North America, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and offers content in a
dozen languages – including English, French, Arabic, Russian, German, Portuguese and
Tibetan – on topics ranging from politics, economics and international relations to culture,
health and sports. The agency also publishes some two dozen newspapers and magazines,
including Reference News (参考消息) which is one of the most widely distributed newspapers in the world and is the most distributed newspaper in China. In the same logic of
multiplying communication formats to broaden its audience, Xinhua has also developed its
own television channel, China Xinhua News Network Corporation (CNC), offering content in Chinese and English, and broadcasting 24/7 in different countries around the world.
The agency also sought to develop videos for phones, a format more suited to directly
reach social network users. Its website, xinhuanet.com, is one of China’s most important
information platforms available in a dozen foreign languages.
Under the direct supervision of the State Council, Xinhua relays information
and the propaganda designed by the Party. For two years, between 1980 and 1982, the
agency was incidentally under the authority of the Propaganda Department. The arrival of
Xi Jinping was also perceived by Xinhua’s journalists as marking the entry into a new era
in which the Chinese media “should no longer be ashamed of being communist media.”74
The agency aims to establish itself as a world leader in the sector and to be able to compete with major media outlets such as CNN, Bloomberg, AP, AFP, and Al Jazeera, in order
to bring the voice of China abroad and present its “true” nature to the rest of the world. In
2010, Xinhua signed a 20-year contract to set up its premises in Times Square in New York;
all the more symbolic of its internationalization is the gigantic 18 x 12 meter LED screen it
rents there with the brand’s logo.75 Eventually, the goal is to turn Xinhua into a conglomerate comparable to News Corp, Viacom or Time Warner. In March 2021, the “China Xinhua
News” account was followed by more than 12 million users on Twitter and more than 89
million on Facebook – probably artificially-inflated figures as we will see (→ p. 182). In
order to better adapt its content to foreign audiences, the agency does not hesitate to recruit
local staff members who are fluent in the language and cultural codes.76 Local “journalists” are generally only tasked with translating dispatches (稿子) previously written
by Chinese employees. In the case of Xinhua’s broadcasts in French, 80% of the dispatches are translations from English and the remaining 20% from Chinese.77 Xinhua has
a specific service for the administration of foreign journalists: The State Administration
of Foreign Experts Affairs. The dispatches translated, and more rarely written, by French
journalists are all proofread by an experienced Chinese journalist who speaks fluent French
and is familiar with the Party’s expectations as well as with its “preferred stories.”78
The agency’s partnerships with several UN international organizations, including
UNESCO, UNEP, UNICEF, UNAIDS, FAO, and UNDP, serve to strengthen its legitimacy
and trustworthiness in the eyes of the international audience.79 The former FAO Director

General, José Graziano da Silva, described the partnership between his organization and
Xinhua as “one of the most important media partnerships for FAO.”80
Since the late 2000s, Xinhua has also been focusing on the African continent. This
strategic shift is notably reflected in the multiplication of training offers for media professionals on the continent (→ p. 202).

2. CCTV/CGTN
Another Chinese media organization that has also been given the mission to compete
with major international media outlets is China Central Television (CCTV). This situation
has incidentally created tensions between the media groups CCTV and Xinhua. CCTV is
the main network of public television channels in China. Beijing TV was established
in 1958 and changed its name to CCTV in 1978. Today, CCTV operates about 40 channels
and it is owned by the China Media Group, since 2018, which is itself under the authority
of the State Council. CCTV’s international development has unfolded gradually. In 1992,
CCTV broadcast its first Mandarin-language program abroad to the diaspora. Its first news
channel entirely in English, CCTV-9, was launched in 2000. By signing an agreement with
News Corp in 2002, CCTV ensured its presence on American cable. From 2004 to 2010,
five other channels in French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian and Portuguese were launched. And
with a production center set up in Nairobi in 2012, CCTV intended to increase its audience
in Africa, which is becoming a new target for Chinese media (→ p. 202). Two other production centers are also being developed in London and Washington DC, the latter becoming
the main center for processing and disseminating information around the world.
CCTV wants to differentiate itself from Xinhua by changing its tone and offering
content that looks less manifestly like state propaganda. The objective is, once again,
to succeed in imposing the “good” image of China abroad and to “correct” the misrepresentation to which it feels subjected to. With that in mind, CCTV-9, the international
division of CCTV, was given a new look in 2016 by changing its visual identity and taking
the name China Global Television Network (CGTN). CGTN now operates a number of
news channels in English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Russian, available in more
than 170 countries and regions around the world.81 According to its official website,
CGTN has “over 150 million followers across the globe” (for its website, mobile applications and social network accounts).82
To increase the attractiveness of its content, CCTV has increasingly used star journalists
to present its shows, such as Yang Rui, who has adopted a dynamic style and does not hesitate to push his guests out of their zone of comfort. Yang Rui was the co-host of Focus,
CCTV’s first English-language news magazine. Emphasis is also put on Chinese culture and
history, with many channels broadcasting documentaries, films, and TV series highlighting
the richness of the Chinese civilization. Regional adaptations employ local presenters and
journalists. On the other hand, Chinese television channels seem less concerned than the
Russians about recruiting Western “stars” to give credibility to their content, as RT America
did with Larry King for example.

CGTN plays a key role not only in spreading a positive discourse on China, but
also in propagating counter-narratives that can discredit criticisms circulating in
Western media, as well as in acting as a relay for Party-constructed narratives. On
this last point, during the Covid-19 crisis, CGTN in Arabic made significant efforts to make
plausible the hypothesis of a virus manufactured by the American army, notably by using
the channel’s star presenter, MsV, who speaks perfect Arabic.83 She eventually used arguments broadcast by other Chinese vectors (→ p. 595).

The “Laurène Beaumond” affair
Context is important: first, on March 3, 2021, the French CSA (Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel,
the French media regulatory authority), authorized CGTN to broadcast in Europe84 – although
the preceding month, its British counterpart (OFCOM) cancelled its broadcasting rights in the
UK and, several days later, fined the channel for its “partiality,” “invasion of privacy,” and
“unfair treatment” in four different cases.85 The fact that the media outlet “found a refuge in
France,” did not fail to elicit criticism.86 Meanwhile, the relationship between China and France
grew more tense in March, due to the Chinese embassy’s decision to pressure French senators to cancel their planned trip to Taiwan, the insult thrown at researcher Antoine Bondaz
(→ p. 237), and the Chinese sanctions against ten European citizens, including the French
MEP Raphaël Glucksmann(→ p. 637).
In this context, on March 27 and 28, CGTN Français published two somewhat offensive
articles from a “Laurène Beaumond”: “Visit of French MPs at Taiwan: the (true) reasons
for the crispation,”87 and “‘My’ Xinjiang: Putting a Stop to the Tyranny of Fake News.”88 The
author was described as “an independent journalist based in France, [who had] lived in Beijing
for seven years and was an editor, reporter, and news TV host who, with “her diplomas in art
history and archeology from the University of Paris Sorbonne-IV and her masters’ in journalism, [had] worked in several Parisian editorial offices before settling in Beijing.” Her article on
Xinjiang was written as a testimony: “I am French and I have lived for 7 years in China.
The fortunes of my life made it that I have some relatives living in Urumqi, the capital city of
Xinjiang. I had the opportunity to visit the region many times between 2014 and 2019, and I do
not recognize the Xinjiang described to me as the one I know.” This article was largely relayed
by pro-Beijing networks, starting with the Embassy of China.
On March 31, the researcher Antoine Bondaz questioned CGTN on Twitter, asking
whether “Laurène Beaumond” was a “fake profile” or not.

This hypothesis was taken up by Nathalie Guibert in an article published by Le Monde
several hours later, in which she confirmed that “no one with that name was found in the database of the Commission of identity cards of French professional journalists.”89 This hypothetical deception– CGTN’s the fabrication of a fake person – was largely covered by international
media in English and led to a flurry of mocking comments and parodic accounts on Twitter.
The following day, on April 1, the topic was discussed in Beijing during a press conference of the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Answering a question from
the AFP, Hua Chunying defended that “this person exist[ed],” and that she was “a French citizen who has lived in China for years,” but that she could not reveal her identity because “now,
in some European countries and in the United States, every time someone says something true
about China, he or she will be viciously attacked.”90 Hence, the spokeswoman implied that
“Laurène Beaumond” was in fact a pseudonym used to protect another person. It was also the
idea defended by CGTN Français that same day, insisting that “Laurène Beaumond” did exist (“CGTN Français has concrete evidence of the several trips made by Laurène Beaumond in
Xinjiang, many photos and even a copy of her marriage license as she was married in Urumqi
in 2014 with someone from the city”) but that the name was a “nom de plume” – while castigating Nathalie Guibert for her “total lack of professionalism” as she did not conceive that
possibility “for a single instant.”91 Why a pseudonym? “To protect herself,” answered the media: “Laurène Beaumond wishes to use a pseudonym and we respected her decision, because
we understand the risk that it represents, for some French journalists, to express their opinion
about China” – mentioning Christian Mestre (→ p. 409) and Maxime Vivas (→ p. 335).
One day later, on April 2, this version was confirmed by Le Figaro, which published an interview with “‘Laurène Beaumond,’ the alias of a very real person.”92 The editorial decision of
Le Figaro to publish this exclusive interview is interesting, not only because it is the great rival
of Le Monde but also because Le Figaro has been a partner of China Daily between 2015 and
2021 (→ p. 188).93 But that did not prevent the article from being both serious and critical of
Beijing. It provided more details about “Laurène Beaumond,” the pseudonym of a forty-yearold woman from the Sarthe, former CGTN TV host who had lived in China between 2011
and 2017, where she married a man from Urumqi. With this information, and what was
initially provided by CGTN, we easily found her real identity, her name and birth name,
as well as a wedding picture. That said, we will not disclose her identity because we respect
her decision to remain anonymous. Several days later, CGTN rubbed it in as it published
an article penned by Zheng Ruolin (→ p. 628) who, using Le Figaro, accused Le Monde and
Antoine Bondaz of “lies” and asked for an “apology” from them.94 The demand was later
renewed in English by the Global Times.95
Now, and even if “Laurène Beaumond” is the pseudonym used by a real person, several
elements remain troubling. First, this “alias” had already been used between October
15 and November 25, 2020, in five articles published by Radio China International
(CRI → p. 181).96 CGTN and RCI are both owned by China Media Group and regularly
share articles. Moreover, when she wrote for RCI five months earlier, “Laurène Beaumond”

was not introduced as a “journalist” but as a “commentator,” and none of her publications
suggested that she would need to “protect” herself from a French popular vendetta.
If “Laurène Beaumond” really is the women from Sarthe who, for years, showed her face on
television as a TV host for CCTV, why would she suddenly need to hide herself to write anodyne articles on sex equality in China or Black Friday? Furthermore, CGTN’s mention of
the cases of Mestre and Vivas is anachronistic: events from 2021 cannot be invoked to
justify the use of a pseudonym dating back from October 2020. Finally, the “journalist’s” title
is misleading for someone who admitted she had not “conduct a journalistic investigation”
in Xinjiang during her “touristic” trips that took place “before the massive internment policy
[…] was implemented full-speed.”97 In a way, as Le Figaro explained, “Laurène Beaumond’s”
testimony only illustrated the CCP strategy which, to defend itself on Xinjiang, “uses
‘testimonies’ from Westerners ostensibly presented as professional ‘journalists’ or experienced ‘researchers’”98 – even when they are not.

The China Daily (中国日报) is the first Chinese newspaper in English. Created in
1981 and operating under the authority of the Propaganda Department of the Central
Committee, it redesigned its layout in 2010 to boost its international development and now
manages about 40 offices and printing centers abroad. An American version was launched
in 2009, a European version in 2010, an Asian version in 2010, and an African version in
2012. The China Daily also distributes a free supplement, “China Watch,” in many major
foreign newspapers in English (→ p. 187).
Like its Chinese state media counterparts, China Daily has a rather distant relationship
with the truth, as illustrated by this Twitter message which used a video shot in Brienz
(Switzerland) to promote Chinese landscapes:99

The Global Times, created after the China Daily, is another Chinese English-language
newspaper that is gaining influence even though it does not belong to the group of
media outlets designated by the government to compete with the world’s largest media
companies. Established in 1993, and owned by the People’s Daily, its first English-language
version dates back to 2009. The intent is still to offer another way to get news about
China, to present the country from its best angle and to defend the interests of those in
power. The newspaper’s editorials often adopt an aggressive and threatening tone on
certain sensitive subjects such as Taiwan,100 and its editor-in-chief, Hu Xijin, is present
on Twitter, which is ironic knowing that the network is banned by Chinese authorities.101

China Radio International (CRI) is one of the oldest and the most important Chinese
radio broadcaster dedicated to an international audience. Created in 1941 first under
the name Radio Peking, it took its current name in 1978 and now belongs, like CCTV, to the
China Media Group which is under the authority of the State Council. Its stated objective
is to “promote good relations between China and the world” and to increase the Chinese
soft power. With some thirty offices abroad, the CRI now produces content in more than
sixty languages.

a much better-known English-language medium however. The same observation can be
made in French, where the Facebook page of CGTN Français (20.4 million fans) is in the
top 5 of the most followed pages, with music stars, soccer stars and a cooking website – far
ahead of all the other French media, which are also a priori much better known: CGTN has
twice as many subscribers as France 24 (10 million) and five times more than Le Monde (4.6),
RFI (4.3), TF1 (4.2), L’Équipe (4), etc.103
Studies conducted in both languages104 concluded that these spectacular numbers
have little credibility, pointing to several indicators, including an exceptional growth
rate (37.8% on average for the eight main Chinese state media outlets in English, 5,000
times higher than the average growth rate of mainstream U.S. media websites) but an
extremely low interaction rate compared to their size (0.006%, 68 times lower than
U.S. media websites).105 In other words, there is a suspicious gap between the huge
number of subscribers and the much smaller number of views on content or comments
on posted messages. A study on French-language Chinese state media106 reveals other
clues. For example, some Facebook posts generated far more engagement than others
(more than 150 times the page’s average, while in general the difference does not exceed
x20) which could not be explained by differences in their content. For example, a CGTN
post on the Guangzhou Fair presented as “a new impetus to world trade” – news that
is not of particular interest to a French-speaking audience – received 165 times more
engagement than the average post on the same page. There are also suspicious discrepancies, on the one hand, between the number of subscribers to these pages on Facebook
compared to other platforms (20 million subscribers to CGTN Français on Facebook
but only 100,000 to CGTN Français on YouTube) and, on the other hand, between the
number of subscribers to these pages on social networks and the traffic on their websites
(between 60,000 and 80,000 visits per month only for francais.cgtn.com).107 Moreover,
many subscribers to these accounts on Twitter and Facebook (who post only in French)
are clearly not French speakers themselves.
Taken together, these clues suggest that, as a December 2019 study noted, China’s state
media “may have artificially inflated their numbers of subscribers and ‘likes.’”108
This is not new: the practice has been observed since at least 2015,109 and, in 2018, The New
York Times had already revealed that Xinhua had paid the Devumi company to gain “hundreds of thousands of followers and retweets on Twitter.”110 Concretely, this means that a
substantial part of the subscribers could actually be bots and fake accounts. It is estimated
for example that “the top 20 Xinhua re-posters are either broadcast or spam bots.”111

French-language Chinese state media also rebroadcast videos produced by a large number
of young French-speaking Chinese women, presented as “journalists,” “presenters,” “video

These pages that appear to be devoted to apolitical subjects (the beauty of Chinese nature,
the richness of Chinese culture, its way of life, cooking, etc.) sometimes also slip messages
with political overtones – following the method identified by Graphika as “Spamouflage”, i.e.
a form of camouflage.

Finally, in terms of content, an automated text analysis of posts published on the Facebook
pages of Chinese state media showed that “a significant share of coverage [focused] on
positive stories, adjusting narratives retroactively, and using ads to spread messaging” as
well as [showing] “a willingness…to spread misinformation that is overtly conspiratorial.”125 It also revealed that the Chinese state media not only praised the Chinese government
and showed its achievements in a positive light on these pages, but also “revised, eliminated,

Aware that a significant proportion of overseas Chinese speak Chinese at home and
consume Chinese-language media, the CCP has set out to win over this population, relying
in particular on newcomers. In the United States, Australia, and Canada (→ p. 539), the
same situation occurred: in the 1980s, the Chinese-speaking media in these countries was
pluralistic and critical because migrants came mainly from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and
those from mainland China, especially after Tian’anmen, were often dissidents. Since then,
waves of immigration from mainland China have changed not only the profile of local
communities, but also the influence of the Chinese-language media, which are more or less
controlled by the CCP, in each of these countries, especially in places where the Chinese
diaspora is significant.
The conquest of Chinese media abroad was conducted through various means
– including buyouts and cooptation and/or pressure by local Chinese associations –
examples of which will be given in the case studies (→ p. 440 and 563). In this way, Beijing
has achieved a virtual monopoly on the world’s Chinese-language media market. In the
United States, “the market for independent Chinese-language information [is] monopolized
by the Qiaobao (China Press) and the SinoVision channel, two media outlets that have been
under the control of the Chinese authorities since their launch and whose content comes
directly from the Chinese state media”; in Australia, “Beijing is said to have infiltrated around
95% of the Chinese-language newspapers,”128 as the editor-in-chief of a pro-Chinese government publication acknowledged.129 The same happened in Canada (→ p. 563) and elsewhere
in the world. Even countries that do not have a large diaspora have received special attention:
Chinese media in Germany, mostly based in Frankfurt, were also “harmonized,” i.e. they have
become very homogeneous and predominately pro-Beijing.
The Australian case was the subject of an ASPI130 report which showed that the main
problem is not direct financing (only one company, out of the 24 analyzed, is officially
owned by the CCP – Global CAMG Media, 60% of which is owned by China Radio
International (CRI), itself a subordinate of the Propaganda Department; two other companies – Pacific Media Group and Nan Hai Culture and Media – have indirect financial ties to
the CCP, because they are owned by Australians who also own joint ventures with Chinese
companies subordinate to the UFWD).131 The main problem – the most effective lever
available to the CCP to control the editorial content of Chinese media abroad – is
the social network WeChat, which will be presented below (→ p. 196). WeChat, which
is estimated to have between 700,000 and more than 3 million daily users in Australia,
has become “the most important medium for [disseminating] Chinese news in the coun126. Ibid., 10.

try.”132 In fact, there are two versions of WeChat, which the company itself describes as
“sister apps” (they are interoperable): Weixin (微信), for users based in mainland China,
and subject to Chinese law, where censorship is stricter; and WeChat, the international
version which, as we will see later, is also the subject of censorship (but to a lesser extent).
However, WeChat only allows “official” accounts, such as those used by the media,
to publish four times a month, each time with a maximum of eight articles, whereas
these limitations do not exist on Weixin – as long as the accounts are registered in the name
of an individual or organization domiciled in China. These rules therefore encourage
Australian Chinese media to register in China, via Weixin, where they fall under
direct CCP censorship. As they are unaware of the exact form of these rules and
what can be said, they tend to censor themselves in order to avoid being suspended
(a phenomenon found elsewhere, such as among Hollywood productions hoping to access
the Chinese market → p. 350). In 2020, an editor of one of Australia’s most followed
WeChat accounts explained that in order to not unintentionally cross a “red line,” she followed the editorial line set by the People’s Daily and Xinhua.133
More generally and independently of WeChat, the ASPI report showed that the Australian
Chinese-language media largely censor themselves, avoiding any criticism of the Chinese
government and the CCP but also avoiding the “five poisons” (Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun
Gong practitioners, pro-democracy activists and Taiwanese independence activists). Other
levers that allow Beijing to exert influence on Australian Chinese-language media include
business ties (especially if the groups that own these media have financial interests in China,
potentially in other sectors), infiltration by the United Front (the executives of 12 of the
24 media groups analyzed were members of United Front organizations) and advertising,
which is the main source of income for most of these media organizations (critical publications are boycotted, therefore financially drained, while complacent publications are
rewarded). These methods are not specific to Australia, as ASPI demonstrated efficiently:
they can be found everywhere in the world where Beijing has an interest in influencing
the media in Chinese. The fourth section of the report will give other examples in the
Taiwanese (→ p. 423) and Canadian (→ p. 539) cases.
In Europe, there may be about one hundred Chinese media channels, mainly in
Germany, France, in the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. In Paris, the European Times (
欧洲时报 → p. 333), founded in 1983 with the help of the Chinese Embassy in France,
and printed in four languages (Chinese, French, English, and German), serves as an
“umbrella” for many other European Chinese-language media and it organizes numerous
events.134 Chinese-language media in Europe have their own association founded in 1997,
the European Chinese Media Association (欧洲华文传媒协会), and they frequently meet
at events in Europe or China (the Global Chinese Language Media Forum (世界华文传
媒论坛) or the Overseas Chinese New Media Forum (海外华文新媒体高峰论坛) for
instance). According to a study by the People’s Daily Overseas Edition Online Data Research
Center (人民日报海外网数据研究中心) which evaluated the influence of 400 Chinese
media abroad, two European media are in the top 20: www.dolc.de (德国热 线), based in
Germany, and xineurope.com (新欧洲), based in France.135

C. Influence on mainstream media
Beijing uses several means to reach a wider audience, beyond the diasporas, and thus
influence the non-Chinese-language media in a large number of countries.

1. Infiltration
a. Through its diplomats
Chinese diplomats are regularly present in the local press through op-eds, articles and
interviews. Liu Xiaoming (刘晓明), the previous Chinese ambassador in London, who had set
a record for his time spent at this position (2010-2021), was known to have established close
relations with the media, even though he was one of the most vehement Chinese diplomats.
In France, the ambassador Lu Shaye (卢沙野) published several op-eds and interviews in the
newspaper L’Opinion – an apparently privileged relationship that is beginning to raise some
questions.136

b. Through the “China Watch” of the China Daily
The China Daily publishes a free supplement, “China Watch,” with a circulation of more than 13 million copies in some 30 daily newspapers worldwide, with
a particular focus on targeting business executives and decision-makers, mainly in Japan
(6.6M in the Mainichi Shimbun) and in the United States (1.7M in The New York Times (up
until the end of 2019), 1.6M in the Los Angeles Times, 1.3M in the Wall Street Journal, 910,000
in The Washington Post (up until the end of 2019), and much less in the Des Moines Register)
but also in Europe (Le Figaro, El País, De Standaard, Le Soir, Handelsblatt), Russia (Rossiskaya
Gazeta), Australia (Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, AFR), New Zealand (The Dominion Post)
and Argentina (El Cronista).137 To convince these newspapers to accept the supplement,
the China Daily offers a financial remuneration. As such, between November 2016 and
April 2020, the China Daily paid nearly $19 million to American newspapers that
published its advertising or supplements,138 including nearly $6 million to the Wall Street
Journal, $4.6 million to The Washington Post, and $50,000 to The New York Times.139
This “Trojan Horse” – or “Worm in the Apple” – tactic,140 has a long-term effect,
disseminating influence daily or weekly, but it can also be used in the short term, on the
occasion of a specific event, such as during an election. For example, during the campaign
for the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, the China Daily used its supplement in
the Des Moines Register (Iowa’s largest daily) to try to weaken Donald Trump in one of his
strongholds. One of the articles highlighted the president’s responsibility for the trade war
and its negative consequences for American farmers.

The Chinese strategy actually aims to produce a triple effect. Two direct effects:
on the one hand, inserting Chinese propaganda into the very heart of the world’s
most influential daily newspapers and in a relatively discreet way, so that the reader may
not necessarily be aware that they are no longer reading their newspaper – a fortiori when
it appears as an online feature on the host newspaper’s website, “further blurring the lines
between Chinese state media content and the host outlet’s own reporting.”142 On the other

hand, for the China Daily, it boosts its image and credibility by being associated with the
major headlines of the Western press. This was also the case for the Russian equivalent,
“Russia Beyond the Headlines,” a supplement launched in 2007 by Rossiyskaya Gazeta which
had the same targets but has only existed in its online version since 2017.143 Finally, there
is also an indirect effect: having financial leverage on the dailies in question, since this
financial windfall makes them more likely to want to please Beijing in order to keep the
contract, more vulnerable to pressure, and more likely to engage in self-censorship.
The Daily Telegraph’s “China Watch”
Until recently, The Daily Telegraph received £750,000 (€835,000) per year to distribute
the “China Watch” supplement of the China Daily.144 This eight-page supplement was included in the newspaper since 2011 and also had a dedicated section on the UK newspaper’s
website after 2015.145 This kind of collaboration created a financial dependence that affected the entire editorial line, not just in the inserted pages: it was in fact found that between
2016 and 2018, The Telegraph published no less than 20 articles of the Chinese ambassador,
twice as many as those published by the Daily Mail, The Guardian and the Financial Times combined.146 The degrading relations between China and the UK in 2019-2020, and particularly
during the Covid-19 pandemic, illustrated a tension between critical articles about China on the
one hand and articles of Chinese propaganda published in the China Daily’s dedicated section
on the other (such as “Why are Some Framing China’s Heroic Efforts to Stop Coronavirus
as Inhumane? “or “Traditional Chinese Medicine “Helps Fight Coronavirus””).147 Finally, in
April 2020, The Telegraph decided to discontinue its collaboration with China Daily.

The Washington Post and The New York Times also terminated their partnerships with China
Daily in late 2019 and early 2020.148 In Australia, the Nine Entertainment group (Sydney
Morning Herald, The Age and the Australian Financial Review) renounced the China Daily supplement at the end of 2020.149 The same year in France, Le Figaro also stopped inserting
“China Watch” in its pages.150 The renunciations are multiplying. Similarly to the Confucius
Institutes (→ p. 306), this is probably the first sign of a durable pushback against what is
now perceived as propaganda, or even as an inacceptable foreign interference.

c. Through accessible and reusable content
Besides the particular case of “China Watch,” which is a regular supplement, Chinese
media also penetrate foreign media by providing them, more or less regularly, with content,
in such a way that “hundreds of millions of news consumers around the world routinely view, read, or listen to information created or influenced by the CCP, often

without knowing its origins.”151 We need to distinguish two situations here, starting with
the free supply of free content. Unlike major Western agencies (AP, AFP, Reuters, etc.),
Chinese agencies (Xinhua, China News Service and CCTV) offer free content. In 2018,
CCTV provided “free video footage and television scripts to 1,700 smaller foreign
news organizations and media groups.”152 This practice is particularly prevalent
in Africa, where local media can least afford to turn them away because they often lack
resources, well-trained journalists, and quality content. In addition, Chinese agencies offer
international news, while most African media cannot afford correspondents abroad. The
fact that local media use Chinese content to cover international news means that “the image
conveyed by the Sahelian media is identical to that which China itself presents.”153 This
practice is not unique to Africa: it occurs everywhere in the world, including in Europe – in
Sweden for example, small media with few means have been offered the use of Chinese
content, images and databases free of charge.154
Then, they also use infomercials: Chinese media pay foreign outlets to include
articles that are nothing but more-or-less explicit advertisement in their printed
pages and/or on their websites that the readers may sometimes find difficult to separate from legitimate articles. This is especially true for the print media, but also for television. In Germany, for example, the private television group Deutsches Regionalfernsehen
(DRF), which had only broadcast animal programs previously, now broadcasts “China
Info,” a daily prime time show which promotes China, sometimes even on political topics
(for example, to claim that there is no proof of the Chinese origin of the coronavirus).
The insertion may seem incongruous, but DRF’s editor-in-chief assumes it, explaining that
it is a “source of income” like any other. Another German example: between 2017
and 2019, the public broadcasting service Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) broadcast a
political and economic debate program on the digital television channel tagesschau24 in
partnership with CGTN: “40,000 German viewers attended without any critical questions
being asked about human rights violations.”155
This is a common practice but, in some cases, it can be an intense media campaign. For
instance, on March 17, 2021, the People’s Daily published an entire page untitled “Injecting
Positive Energy for World Development,” in which it congratulated itself for the diffusion of 750 different articles – described as “informational products” (新闻产品) – in
nearly 200 foreign media, from more than 40 countries, in 12 languages, and during
an entire week (March 5-11).156 It coincided with the annual congress of the two Chinese
assemblies (PNA and CPPCC). It also coincided with the launch of the “14th five-year
plan” and Beijing hoped to circulate the representation of an efficient China, which had
extirpated its immense population from poverty and made scientific achievements. To do
that, the People’s Daily introduced paid promotional inserts in widely circulated newspapers

– so many that the campaign probably cost dozens of millions of dollars in less than
a week.157
In France, for example, the newspaper L’Opinion published two “advertorials” on March
11 (with the mention “content produced by the People’s Daily”) that bragged about China’s
ability to “reduce poverty while preserving the environment” on the one hand,158 and the
resilience of the Chinese economy on the other (see below).159 Normally, without knowing
how much the People’s Daily eventually paid, a full page in L’Opinion costs between €18,000
and €30,000.160

Interestingly, the host media are not always comfortable with this collaboration
when it becomes public, as illustrated by the following example. On March 17, 2021, Jeune
Afrique published an article by He Qian, the Parisian director of the French online version
of the People’s Daily, promoting Maxime Vivas’s book on the Uyghurs – which, as we will
see, “dismantles the information of Western media that accuse China of violating human
rights in this region in full expansion” (→ p. 335). The mention “sponsored content” was
added at the bottom of the text. As such, it was probably an article published by People’s
Daily thanks to an agreement with Jeune Afrique. Its publication was actually relayed by the
Chinese embassy in France. This agreement was quickly denounced on Twitter, including
by Antoine Bondaz who presented it as “a concrete example of the use, by the [Chinese]
authorities, of paid partnerships with foreign media to disinform,” and he tagged @jeuneafrique on this post.161 The criticism was efficient: the following day, the article was withdrawn and the link did not work anymore – which seems to indicate that, in hindsight, Jeune
Afrique rapidly came to the conclusion that the article bore a reputational risk.

The article, published online on March 17, was withdrawn on March 18,162
but the webpage was archived and remains accessible.163

2. Acquisition
Foreign media purchases are multiplying, not only in Asia (see: Taiwan), but also in
Europe,164 such as in Hungary, Italy and Portugal: the two oldest Portuguese newspapers,
Diário de Notícias, founded in 1864, and Jornal de Notícias, founded in 1888, are owned by
a Chinese joint venture (as are other media in the country, including TSF radio and the
sports newspaper O jogo).165 There are generally consequences on the editorial line.
When two Czech media groups, Empresa Media and Médea, came under the control of the
Chinese consortium CEFC in 2015, the media of these groups “including Tyden (a weekly)
and Barrandov TV, distinguished themselves by their inordinately enthusiastic coverage of
China.”166
This risk is higher in the most open media circles, where there are still places to be
taken. This is one of the factors that explain why Japan remains relatively less vulnerable to
Chinese influence than other countries in the region (see box below).

Despite their geographical proximity, China’s influence in Japan is limited compared to other
democracies for a number of reasons: first, due to an insularity that is both historical
and economic (the “Galapagos Syndrome”) that makes the Japanese difficult to influence
from the outside; a fortiori by the Chinese toward whom most feel distrust at best, or even
antipathy (85% of Japanese presumably have a negative opinion of China –among the
34 countries surveyed by Pew, Japan is the country with the highest negative opinions of
China). This is in part grounded in a common history of nearly 2,000 years which, in the
recent period, has seen several bloody wars and, more recently, the 2010-2012 conflict over
the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and China’s subsequent decision to stop exporting rare earth
materials to Japan. This has often been described as a “turning point” in their relationship.167

Other factors are the important homogeneity of the Japanese population;168 its great
political stability as, aside from two short digressions (1993-1994 and 2009-2012), the
same party, the PLD (自由民主党), has been in power since 1955, and the other parties
are not easier to influence (even the Japanese Communist Party, with little political weight,
is relatively nationalist and therefore not very sensitive to Chinese influence);169 and very
strict rules, especially on financial contributions to political parties and foreign investment
(to protect domestic companies). To all this, one must add, in recent years, a greater awareness of the Chinese threat, through other examples (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia), and
strengthened intelligence capabilities – which make any Chinese attempt to influence
even more difficult than before.
As for the media, the 810,000 Chinese living in Japan are a privileged target for Beijing,
notably via the local Chinese-language media, most of which only pick up on the dispatches
written by Xinhua or the People’s Daily.170 The Japanese Chinese-language newspaper with the
highest circulation, Chubun News (Chinese Review Weekly) “toe[s] the CCP line.”171 But its influence is as limited as its readership. Overall, the Japanese media market is oligopolistic:
five conglomerates (TBS-Mainichi, TV Asahi-Asahi, NTV-Yomiuri, Fuji TV-Sankei, and TV
Tokyo-Nikkei) divide the media landscape among themselves, leaving almost no room for
anything else, including outside influence. Beijing is unable to penetrate the Japaneselanguage media market, which is generally very resistant to any outside influence, except
perhaps that of the United States (with the Japanese version of the Wall Street Journal). Nor
has there been any significant acquisition of Japanese media by Chinese groups. There is the
case of the inclusion of the “China Watch” in the Mainichi Shimbun but, on the one hand, the
newspaper accepts “news on travel issues but no political or economic issues” and, on the
other hand, the Japanese readership see these pages for what they are: advertising.172 For all
of these reasons, Japan offers relatively few holds for the usual Chinese tactics, which does
not prevent Beijing from identifying other vulnerabilities, including separatists and pacifist
movements (→ p. 401).

Two radio stations broadcasting in the United States are controlled by Beijing
In April 2020, The Washington Free
Beacon revealed that two local radio stations were actually controlled by
Beijing: one is a Mexican radio station
owned by the Chinese Phoenix TV
Group, which broadcasts Chineselanguage propaganda from a tower in
Mexico that allows it to reach across
the border into southern California,
circumventing U.S. regulations.173 The
other is the Las Vegas Public Radio
(LVPR), which, contrary to its name, is not a public radio station (it is not affiliated to the
National Public Radio network), but a radio station registered as a lobbyist for Huawei.174 The
station assumes this role, as the tweet below shows. In its broadcasts, it indeed tries to counter
the idea, which is very present in the United States, that Huawei is a threat to national security.
Since its inception in 2016, it has employed two Chinese citizens as “international liaisons,”

one of whom became its program director. It not only defends Huawei but, more generally,
disseminates official Chinese narratives on issues such as the Hong Kong crisis. Its founding
president, Gregory LaPorta, met with foreign ministry officials in Beijing in October 2019 and
won support from the Chinese government for his plan to open an office in China.

3. Cooptation
Beijing cultivates foreign media producing favorable content, seducing them in exchange
for compensations (advertisements, all-expenses-paid trips/trainings in China,
contracts with other companies of the same group, “and even political appointments”).175 These “bought” private media subsequently alter their editorial line and relay
pro-Beijing positions. Another method producing the same result is to cultivate local figures of influence (various personalities, politicians, researchers, etc.) that, in turn, intervene
in local media to defend pro-Beijing positions. In all cases, Beijing benefits from “strings”
that can be concealed, since these positions, defended on private outlets by private individuals, are not directly attributable to Beijing.

4. Training and networking
a. “Training” journalists
The General Administration of Press and Publication (known until 2018 as the State
Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television, 新闻出版总署) has in
recent years hosted trainings for more than 3,400 media professionals from 146 countries. In some countries, a majority of journalists has been trained in China: this is
the case in Grenada where 70% of media professionals have visited China since 2013, with
consequences for the editorial line of local media. “This “‘re-education’ of Grenadian
journalism has had a major impact on the local media, which have become much more
reverential toward China. The situation is similar in the neighboring islands of Dominica
and Barbados, where the media have also benefited from Chinese largesse.”176
They offer several programs: special 26-day BRI training courses (“Dongfang” fellowships); “red carpet” fellowships, which bring nearly 100 journalists from the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Africa every year for a ten-month stay. They are “received
like film stars, they are given luxurious accommodation in central Beijing, two trips a month
to different Chinese provinces, Chinese-language courses and a monthly stipend of up to
5,000 RMB (650 euros). At the end, the journalists even receive a diploma in international
relations from a Chinese university.”177 RSF noted that “the journalists are not chosen by
their editors, but by the Chinese embassy with the Party’s approval. And something
is demanded in return. The conditions are clear: they must promise to ‘tell the China
story well’ and even portray its authoritarian regime as a democracy and international peacemaker. The guests are not, however, allowed to move around freely during
their stay.”178

The practice is widespread: half of the journalists’ unions surveyed in 58 countries
and territories around the world in September and October 2019 responded that journalists from their countries or territories had participated in such trainings in China,
lasting from two weeks to ten months.179 Beijing seems to target primarily journalists with “ineffective or repressive governments”180 but not only: all countries
are ultimately targeted, including those with effective governments, such as Singapore
(CGTN invites many Singaporean journalists to China for training that they call “familiarization trips” and that some Singaporeans ironically call “indoctrination trips”) 181
or Australia (dozens of Australian journalists in recent years). A particular effort has
recently been given to Muslim journalists, who have been specifically selected, even in
non-Muslim countries, to visit Xinjiang and influence their coverage of the Uyghur
issue.182
Beijing also seeks to formalize its relationships: 36% of the journalists’ unions surveyed (55% of them in Europe) had been offered an MoU by a Chinese entity, “a classic
United Front strategy [...] to co-opt entities traditionally perceived as hostile or neutral.”183
Furthermore, more than a third of respondents said that content-sharing agreements with
Chinese media – which either offer it for free or pay the local media to circulate stories –
were in place in their country.184

b. Networks
Beijing creates networks, through regular events such as the World Media Forum,
established in 2009, and “which – as its name fails to suggest- is entirely designed, organized and funded by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua.”185 The 10th edition in October
2019 brought together more than 400 Chinese-language media representatives from 61
countries. The All-China Journalists Association (ACJA) also organizes a Belt and Road
Journalists Forum bringing together around 100 media representatives from about 50
countries and, since April 2019, a formal network, the Belt and Road News Network
(BRNN), chaired by the People’s Daily in Beijing, bringing together 72 media outlets from
42 countries.186

5. Constraints
In line with its usual methods to encourage self-censorship, Beijing uses carrots
(advertising resources, contracts, benefits in kind, etc.) but also sticks, taking a
number of direct actions such as using visas as weapons against critical foreign journalists, leveraging family members and close friends in China, intimidating local journalists and/or media via Chinese diplomats (threatening phone calls and emails, naming
and shaming, etc.) The Swedish case (→ p. 521) is not isolated. There are many examples
around the world of harsh reporting on China that was suppressed at the last moment,
or of critical journalists who were fired. In South Africa, just hours after publishing an

editorial on Uyghur persecutions, the journalist Azad Essa was fired from Independent
Online because Chinese investors had a 20% stake in the publication.187 Of course, this
does not always work. In December 2018, an attempt by “Chinese diplomats” to cancel
the broadcast of the documentary The World According to Xi Jinping scheduled on Arte (a
European public channel) “by intervening with the channel in Paris and with the Quai
d’Orsay”188 ultimately failed.
The CCP also exerts indirect, more subtle pressure via intermediaries, “advertisers, satellite firms, technology companies, foreign governments and international organizations – to prevent or punish the publication of unfavorable content.” The pressure
is also legal, through the threat of prosecution, which pertains to lawfare (→ p. 53).
Finally, it can go as far as the use of force. Chinese cyberattacks (mainly DDOSs
and phishing attacks) are not only aimed at individuals and communities within the
Chinese diaspora, who are considered by Beijing as threats (the “five poisons”) – even
if they do remain priority targets – but also at major foreign media: the servers of The
New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, for example, have been
attacked.189 In Hong Kong, for several years, journalists have been physically attacked
by people suspected of being linked to Beijing, and cases intensified during the 2019
crisis.190

D. Control over the containers
The “CCP’s approach over the past decade has been at least as such about controlling
the medium as about controlling the message,”191 as one enables the other. In other words,
Beijing is developing “a sophisticated strategy to influence every stage of the global
information supply chain, from the people who produce content to the institutions that
publish it and the platforms that deliver it directly to consumers.”192

1. Television
A satellite TV service provider, for example, has the power to prioritize a particular channel in its offerings. Hence, when the Chinese group StarTimes, which was
instrumental in the transition from analog to digital on the African continent, provides
services to its millions of subscribers. It prioritizes CCTV channels in its package
deals, to the detriment of independent international news channels. “In Kenya,
Uganda and Nigeria, for example, packages that include international options like the
BBC World Service cost more than basic packages with local channels and Chinese state
media, sometimes beyond the reach of what many African families can afford”;193 “3 to
5 euros a month for a StarTimes multichannel subscription, as against at least 12 euros
for Canal Plus, for example.”194

2. Digital Platforms
In this area, Beijing is clearly on a path of conquest. In May 2020, the Academy
of Social Sciences wrote that Beijing should use its platforms – WeChat, Weibo and
TikTok – to counter the influence of American platforms – Twitter, Facebook, and
YouTube.195

a. WeChat
Launched in 2011, first as a mobile messaging application, WeChat (微信) was developed by Tencent and it has quickly become a real ecosystem offering a wide range of
services: calls, transmission of images, videos, and voice messages, information dissemination, mobile payment, gaming, etc. It is the most popular social network in China and
is now indispensable to access certain services.196 But it is also the third most popular
social network in the world, with more than 1.2 billion monthly users in the third quarter of 2020.197 In January 2019, as many as 45 billion messages were sent on the platform
every day198 – likely many more today. WeChat is increasingly used by non-Chinese
speakers, especially, but not only, by politicians, to reach out to their Chinese electorate,
such as in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada.
First, WeChat poses a problem of surveillance and censorship. The messages
exchanged on the app (which are not encrypted) pass through a server managed by
Tencent which filters, detects, blocks, and reports to the Chinese authorities the
content they consider unacceptable. In several successive studies since 2016, Citizen
Lab (University of Toronto) has shown how censored messages are those that contain
one or more keywords, or combinations of keywords, that are automatically detected.199
One hacker also showed that, out of 3.8 billion messages intercepted on March 18, 2019,
59 millions of which were in English and 19 millions of which were sent from outside
China, keywords such as “Xi Jinping,” “CCP,” “Rights,” “1989,” “Tibet,” “Authorities,”
“Crackdown,” “Party,” “Tian’anmen” automatically triggered the selection of the conversation for review.200 In this way, WeChat censors in real time.201 The app can also automatically detect and censor images (by comparing them with a database of banned
images considered “politically sensitive,” and using an “MD5 hash” – a kind of digital
fingerprint).202

The Covid-19 led to another round of censorship on WeChat: many users in
North America, Europe, and Asia have noticed that, since February 2020, their contacts in China can no longer see messages that others post in shared groups.203 An initial
study showed that between January 1 and 31, 2020, 132 keyword combinations related to
the outbreak, in both simplified and traditional Chinese, triggered censorship, and then
another 384 between February 1 and 15, for a total of 516 in that month-and-a-half
period. Among the sub-topics censored were the CCP’s response to the crisis, in particular any criticism of the measures taken; the policies implemented in Hong Kong, Taiwan
and Macau; and a few specific individuals, such as Dr. Li Wenliang (19 combinations with
his name), one of the first doctors to have warned of the outbreak of the virus and who
died in Wuhan on 7 February.204 A second study showed that between January 1 and May
31, a total of 2,174 key words were censored (162 in January, 645 in February, 501 in
March, 628 in April, 238 in May).205
“In Canada, WeChat censors deleted a Member of Parliament’s message to constituents praising Hong Kong’s Umbrella Movement protesters, manipulated dissemination of news reports related to Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou’s arrest, and blocked
broader media coverage of Chinese government corruption and leading Chinese officials. In the United States, Chinese Americans have reported censorship of WeChat posts
in group conversations about local political issues, or had their accounts shut down after
commenting about democratic parties’ victory in Hong Kong’s district council elections in
November 2019.”206 Messages posted by diplomatic missions are also widely censored: when the accounts of the American and British talk about Hong Kong, the South
China Sea, the pandemic, and ethnic minorities, the Uyghurs for instance, or when the
account of the Indian embassy talks about the clashes between the Chinese and Indian
armies in Ladakh.207
Citizen Lab has shown that surveillance on WeChat affects all users, including those
abroad, whereas it was initially thought to apply only to accounts registered in China.208
Not only are “documents and images shared among non-China-registered accounts…subject to content surveillance [but they are also] used to build up the database WeChat uses to
censor China-registered accounts.”209 In other words, those who use WeChat in France,
the United States, Australia, Canada, are indirectly contributing to enhancing the
surveillance of the population in China.
Second, WeChat also poses a problem of propaganda and disinformation. One of
its peculiarities, especially when compared to applications such as WhatsApp, is that users
can create private chat groups but also receive information from official accounts.210 This
makes WeChat a hybrid application, both private messaging and social media, that competes
with other information sources. Beijing thus uses WeChat as a vehicle to reach Chinese
communities abroad directly, through official accounts, or indirectly, by instrumentalizing

local agents of influence. This report describes numerous cases where WeChat was used
to monitor, intimidate, and mobilize Chinese students on campus (→ p. 274), raise
money to fund legal action against a journalist critical of Beijing (→ p. 576), and
spread fake news and conspiracy theories, for example about the origin of Covid-19
(→ p. 599). WeChat has also been used for election interference, to encourage voting for certain candidates of Chinese origin, as in Canada (→ p. 562), or voting against
an incumbent government, as in Australia (→ p. 269). During the May 2019 election in
Australia, where WeChat is the primary source of information for 26% of citizens of
Chinese descent, a “fear campaign” against the Labor Party was organized on WeChat
“in a way that could influence critical marginal seats, away from the scrutiny of the main
campaign.”211 The Chinese app also caused a stir in Canada in 2019 when Karen Wang, the
Liberal Party candidate in the Burnaby South district in British Columbia used it to try to
win the votes of the Chinese community in her district, reminding members of the Chinese
diaspora that she was the “only candidate of Chinese descent” against the NDP’s Jagmeet
Singh, of “Indian descent.” Karen Wang was heavily criticized in the media and on social
networks and was forced to withdraw.212
In France, the United Front’s agents of influence, acting through the Association for
China’s Peaceful Reunification,213 also use WeChat to mobilize the population of Chinese
descent during elections214 or to support demonstrations, such as the movement that arose
“spontaneously” against “injustice and police violence” after the death of Liu Shaoyao,
who was shot by the police in March 2017. Chinese authorities have asked France to shed
light on this case, but they have also mobilized, via WeChat in particular, the French population of Chinese origin and Chinese residents in France215 to put pressure on the French
government.
A study conducted by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism216 at Columbia University,
on the use of WeChat in the United States also showed that the level and nature of disinformation operations on the network were similar to what could be observed on
Facebook: hyper-partisan comments, caricatures, stories leading to the reinforcement of
dissent. Certain topics are the subject of recurrent debates, such as the question of the
integration of minorities (especially Asian minorities), discrimination, the right and conditions of the vote, and unemployment. Rumors are also frequent and tend to accentuate
the divisions in the American society.217 But most rumors and fake news seem to come
from private groups and individuals who have no state support and do not, for that matter,
always seem to have a political agenda.

on WeChat, debunked a false story about a national day of riots on November 3, 2017. This rumor emerged on 4Chan
before spreading on WeChat. See Daniel Funke, “On WeChat, Rogue Fact-Checkers are Tackling the App’s Fake News
Problem,” Poynter (3 Jul. 2018).

b. Weibo
Second largest social network in China after WeChat: Weibo (微博), which means
“microblog” in Chinese, and is a microblogging website similar to Twitter. It was created
by the Chinese company Sina Corporation – hence its full name “Sina Weibo” (新浪微
博) – in 2009, a year marked by the twentieth anniversary of Tian’anmen but also by the
Urumqi Riots in Xinjiang, following which the Chinese authorities decided to block Twitter,
Facebook, and the Chinese equivalent of Twitter at the time, Fanfou (饭否).218 With some
511 million active monthly users in the third quarter of 2020, Weibo has reportedly had
more users than Twitter in recent years.219
Generally presented as the Chinese Twitter, the Weibo platform is actually more like
Facebook. It is possible to create groups, share stories, texts beyond the initial 140-character limit (lifted in 2016),220 live-stream, and make purchases. The strategic partnership
signed with Alibaba – which acquired 18% of Weibo in 2013, then 30% in 2015 – has
indeed made the development of e-commerce features possible on the platform.
As with WeChat, access to the platform is increasingly regulated and requires the verification of the user’s identity. The content that circulates on the platform is subjected to
ever-increasing surveillance. In 2012, the Greatfire.org website already estimated that
about 2,500 words were blocked on it.221 In 2017, the platform recruited 1,000 “monitors”
(监 督员) among its users to monitor and report pornographic, harmful, and illegal content. These monitors had to report at least 200 pieces of content for a fixed monthly fee
of RMB200, or less than €30, and there were in-kind rewards (cell phones and computers)
for the ten best performing monitors of the month, i.e., those who reported the most content.222 The Cyberspace Administration had previously sanctioned the platform for disseminating illegal information and for other problems, although it is not clear for what specific
content the platform was punished.223
Also, censorship efforts do not spare foreign governments whose embassies or officials choose to open an account on the platform. In 2011, the Canadian embassy’s post
about Chinese fugitive Lai Changxing (赖昌星) was immediately deleted for instance.224
Censorship can take various forms, ranging from the outright deletion of the publication,
either immediately or with a delay, to the temporary deactivation of the commenting and
sharing features of the publications.225 In order to circumvent censorship, the U.S. embassy’s account came up with the idea of sharing a politically charged article which discussed,
among other things, Wang Lijun (王立军), a police officer, and Chen Guangcheng (陈光
诚), a Chinese activist, and their efforts to gain political asylum in the United States but

by publishing a post ostensibly about Michael Jackson.226 To announce the publication of
the 2013 report on human rights and democracy and beat the censorship, the UK embassy’s account used techniques borrowed from the “Martian” language (火星文).227 Rather
than writing “人权” (renquan) for “human rights,” the embassy split the second character
into two, “人 (木又)” (ren (muyou)), which no longer means anything to the algorithm that
locates the monitored keywords, but is still understandable to the human eye. Similarly,
instead of writing “民主” (minzhu) for “democracy,” the first letters of their transliteration
into pinyin, “MZ,” allow a reference to this word.

c. TikTok
TikTok, a video-sharing social network, is the international version of Douyin (抖音),
launched in China in 2016 and developed by ByteDance. TikTok was launched in September
2017 and has since grown dramatically around the world, notably in the United States
where it counted 100 million active monthly users in August 2020, an 800% increase since
January 2018. Globally, TikTok had approximately one billion users in January 2021.228 Like
WeChat and Weibo, TikTok is a monitored and censored platform. An ASPI report
found “that TikTok engages in censorship on a range of political and social topics, while
also demoting and suppressing content.”229 The report noted that “ByteDance executives,
including CEO Zhang Yiming (张一鸣), have stated on the record that they’ll ensure that
their products serve to promote the CCP’s propaganda agenda. [They] made it clear that
the party line should be integrated into the company’s apps down to the level of
the algorithm.” For example, in 2018, a joke-sharing app developed by the company was
removed: “The product [had] gone astray, posting content that [went] against socialist core
values,” Zhang recounted.230 The company has since hired 4,000 additional censors and
invested a lot of money to develop an algorithm that incorporates these “socialist core
values.”
Another milestone was reached during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020: a former
employee testified that “ByteDance’s army of content moderators were using the tools
and algorithms that I helped develop to delete content, change the narrative and
alter memories of the suffering and trauma inflicted on Chinese people during the
COVID-19 outbreak.” He also explained that, in early 2020, the company employed
20,000 content moderators solely tasked with surveilling the Chinese traffic. Additionally,
he showed how automatic censorship worked: the soundtrack of livestreamed events is
automatically transcribed into text and an algorithm then compares the text with “a long
and constantly-updated list of sensitive words, dates and names” that normally triggers
a report. The Cyberspace Administration of China constantly sends directives – sometimes more than a hundred a day – to ByteDance’s Content Quality Center (内容质量中
心) which then integrates them in its moderation. And its technical team receives multiple demands to build “an algorithm that could automatically detect when a Douyin user
spoke Uyghur, and then cut off the livestream session” because the moderators did not

understand the language. It eventually did not follow through with the project for technical reasons. He then explained that political contents represented only a portion of the
‫مثلي_الجنس‬#
deleted contents, because “Chinese netizens are fluent in self-censorship and know
‫مثلي الجنس‬
what not to say.”231
Censorship covers not only the usual topics (videos mentioning Tian’anmen,
Tibetan independence, or Falun Gong are removed),232 but also LGBTQ+ topics (the
hashtags #гей (“gay” in Russian), #ягей (“I am gay” in Russian), #ялесбиянка (“I am
a lesbian” in Russian), # ‫مثلي_الجنس‬# (“gay” in Arabic), # ‫المتحول جنسيا‬# (“transgender” in
Arabic), #gei (“gay” in Estonian),
automatically removed from
‫مثلي الجنس‬#gej (“gay” in Bosnian) are
‫المتحول جنسيا‬
the platform), and criticism of certain political leaders or regimes (“#путинвор”
(“Putin is a thief ” in Russian)). TikTok’s justification is a “localized approach to moderation” in which it restricts access to certain terms to comply with “local laws.”233 Yet the
Guardian found that LGBTQ+ content was censored even in countries where homosex‫المتحول جنسيا‬#
uality was not illegal.234
‫ المتحول جنسيا‬files obtained by The Intercept showed that “TikTok
Furthermore, leaked moderation
has influenced content on its platform not just by censoring videos and disappearing users, but by padding feeds with content from ‘shadow accounts’ operated by company employees posing as regular users. Internal employee guidelines
[...] suggest that ByteDance employees scoured Instagram for popular topics, downloaded the videos, and reshared them to TikTok to maintain a steady spray of appealing
content.”235
Samantha Hoffman, author of an ASPI report on data collection by Chinese state-owned
enterprises,236 added that “TikTok is a good example of a seemingly benign app that
can give the CCP a lot of useful data … [that] can be used to understand how people
are influenced and how they think.”237

3. Smartphones
As hardware has an impact on software and installable applications, allowing surveillance
and espionage, Chinese smartphone manufacturers, especially Huawei and Xiaomi,
are regularly incriminated. Regarding Huawei especially, RSF noted that “[a] key partner
in Chinese Internet censorship and in the persecution in Xinjiang province, Huawei has
also been accused of installing a ‘backdoor’ in some of its products that allows secret
access to data, and of providing its surveillance technologies to the Iranian regime.”238

E. The Case of Africa
The major agencies – Xinhua, CGTN and China Daily – have offices in Africa. In
2012, Xinhua and CCTV installed their African headquarters in Nairobi, from where they
produce content in English and French for the entire continent. China Radio International
(CRI) is based in Dakar. In general, the editorial structure is dual, with draft articles reviewed
first by African editors and then (censored by) Chinese editors in Beijing. There are few
constraints on African journalists when they write, but they subsequently quickly realize
that the published text may be very different from what they have submitted.239
Chinese censorship and procedures heavily impact the format of the broadcasts
and the daily work of the staff, as Selma Mihoubi explained: “[the] journalists and translators working for CRI are subject to strict rules of compliance with the communiqués
issued by the authorities. They must conform to the terminology used in Chinese, and
thus act as a mouthpiece for the government. Also, live broadcasts are impossible or very
rare on CRI, as all information must be double-checked by the CCP. All stories must be
checked again before being broadcast, a time-consuming task that prevents Chinese
radio from being first in broadcasting international news.”240 All of this undermines the
popularity of Chinese broadcasts in Africa, which are less responsive and always very
official in tone, a contrast with competing Western or Russian media “that rely on speed
and sensationalism to hook their listeners.”241
The vast majority of African journalists are critical, and they willingly “denounce
the bad journalistic practices of Chinese media, some of which are considered anti-democratic, such as the censorship and systematic proofreading of articles by an officer of
the Chinese Communist Party, or the ban on live broadcasts.”242 African populations are
apparently not fooled and do not trust Chinese media more than African media.243 “Most
Africans realise the subjectivity of the news programmes broadcast by China. They consume all kinds of content distributed by the Chinese media, but mistrust the news programmes.”244 On the other hand, they appreciate the positive tone of Chinese media:
there is a widespread belief that Western media are biased and convey a catastrophic and
miserable vision of Africa that focuses on conflicts, natural disasters, and governance problems. From this point of view, the Chinese approach of “constructive” or “positive” journalism (to tell “good stories” about China but also about China-Africa relations and their
successes, etc.) is attractive. There is a need for positivity to which Chinese media responds
by emphasizing economic development, infrastructure, or a modern Africa that is moving
on, on path to development, etc.245
Beijing has made significant efforts to attract African journalists, with donations of equipment to local newsrooms (computers, printers, microphones, smartphones,
etc.) and frequent invitations to China. Each year, the China-Africa Media Cooperation
Forum invites about 30 African journalists for training trips that last from six to ten months.

Studies (National Endowment for Democracy) and the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana)

African journalists who participated quickly understood that there were not there to receive
training: they were embarked on visits of cultural sites and infrastructure projects, attended
lectures on the Chinese system of governance, and they met with representatives of official
Chinese state media.246
In order to seduce the local populations, Beijing is also developing a pro-Third-World
discourse, reminding its audience of the Chinese commitment to African independence and
that, “from a historical point of view, there is no colonial history between China and Africa,
on the contrary, China and Africa have been the object of colonial aggression; they have
the same experience.”247 To move in this direction, Beijing introduced a resolution against
colonialism at the UN Human Rights Council (→ p. 216) on September 29, 2021, a few
days after the deputy spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhao Lijian (→ p. 232),
denounced the “historical debts,” which included “the colonial system” of “some Western
countries.” According to Antoine Kernen, a researcher at the University of Lausanne, “in
many respects, China is pursuing a colonial policy in the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, exploiting the resources there and pushing aside the local populations. [However,] China’s maneuver
at the Human Rights Council is not directed at the West, as it gave up trying to convince it,
but at Africa. The anti-Western discourse is aimed at an increase of its sphere of influence.”248 That said, and despite their efforts, Chinese media sometimes harm themselves by
portraying a stereotypical or even racist image of local people, as illustrated by the annual
Spring Festival Gala on CCTV, which sparked controversy.249

These persisting blunders may be explained in the same way as those committed by
Beijing elsewhere in the world, notably in Europe: Chinese state media are primarily
tasked with projecting the image of a strong and powerful China among its people
– as such, the incidence of propaganda abroad is often an afterthought.251

In terms of content, as often, China talks a lot about itself, most prominently about
its president (news about Xi Jinping), its companies and their activities in Africa, its development aid (especially in the agricultural and medical fields), its history and culture. It is an
exclusively ameliorative coverage (for China), and potentially controversial subjects are
avoided: “subjects such as the exploitation of oil or uranium, or the use of fishing resources
by Chinese companies are not covered.”252 In the Sahel, their coverage of the conflict in
Mali focuses on the MINUSMA, which again deals with itself since the MINUSMA has a
large contingent (400) of Chinese Blue Helmets.
The Chinese media also played a role in Burkina Faso’s decision to abandon Taiwan in
May 2018, as they helped isolate the country in the region: “[it] was indeed their isolation,
accompanied by a Chinese offensive to gain a foothold in the Sahel – for example with the
opening of a Chamber of Commerce in Burkina Faso, the recruitment of local journalists
and the creation of an Association of Friends of China in Burkina Faso – that led to the
decision.”253
In any case, “contrary to Russian organizations, Chinese agencies remain focalized on the diffusion of narratives on the Chinese regime, without trying to adapt
themselves to the local problematics and arguments, which heavily limits their popularity and ultimately their propagation in Africa.”254 (See box below).

Russian media are much more reproduced than Chinese media
A French team from the GEODE research lab (University of Paris 8) analyzed “content written
in French by two Russian agencies (548 articles from RT and Sputnik) and five Chinese agencies (230 articles from Xinhua, CCTV, CRI, CRI Senegal, and China Daily) on topics dealing
with Africa,” i.e., 3,889 pages that reproduced all or part of the stories written by the Russian
media and 484 pages that reproduced the Chinese media. First observation: Russian content
was reproduced much more often (7.09 times on average) than Chinese content (2.1).255 The
authors explained this by the fact that “most of the content published by Chinese media outlets dealt with Chinese preoccupations and not African issues […] the diplomatic, nationalistic, and defense nature of Chinese media publications hindered their popularity in
African publics, as their content is not very relevant to their concerns. The content produced
by Russian media, on the other hand, dealt with much more diverse and politically engaged
themes and issues, which explained why there were many more platforms that pick up Russian
content.”256 There were variations between the countries: for example, the largest number of
websites relaying Chinese media was found in Guinea, Senegal, Algeria, Morocco, Ivory Coast,
and Benin, and the most consulted relaying websites were in Ivory Coast, Morocco, Tunisia,
and Niger.257 The researchers also believed that “the coverage of Chinese content in Africa
was not an ideological and activist phenomenon on the part of relaying websites, but usually
an “easy” solution as the articles were freely available and allowed African outlets to relay or
cover the relations between China and African countries.”258

III. Diplomacy
A. International Organizations and Standards
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, with a veto power, and it holds several key positions in the organization,
including the top executive position in four of the fifteen specialized agencies. It provides
one of the largest financial contributions and has more peacekeeping troops deployed
around the world than the other four permanent members of the Security Council – the
US, Russia, France, and the U.K. – combined. Hence, it has unquestionably become a major
player on the international scene since joining the UN in 1971.
Rather than adapting itself to international norms, the PRC has shown that it seeks
instead to overhaul the international system (→ p. 148). Since Xi Jinping came to power,
the PRC has defended the vision of a “community of common destiny,” “a shared future
for mankind,” where a logic of “win-win cooperation” would allow all states to develop and
every individual to “enjoy human rights.”259 This ambition is presented as a project for a
“better world” carried out by China. In fact, it is a plan to reshape the world to conform to
the CCP’s goals, and to “Sinicize international norms.”260 And these ideas have already penetrated UN institutions. Several resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council,
the Human Rights Council and the Economic and Social Council have used language coined
by the Party.261 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), presented as a project of global
connectivity and win-win cooperation, but which is above all the projection of a strategy
of influence, has been approved by the UN for instance (→ p. 206). Secretary-General
António Guterres stated that the BRI was aligned with the 2030 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) UN Agenda, and that the UN would therefore support member states that
wish to integrate BRI projects into their economies and societies.262
International organizations are seen by Chinese authorities as instruments to project
its influence, and thus the UN is the first platform that China seeks to control. One of its
strategies is to “form voting coalitions in the United Nations, then use them as leverage to propel its citizens or allies to the head of strategic international organizations with
the aim of imposing its vision on the entire global community.”263 These voting coalitions
notably include African countries for which China is the largest trading partner, or which
are heavily indebted and therefore obliged to China.
Beijing does not hesitate to use classical diplomacy, as well as clandestine influence operations, to exert economic and political pressure, to use cooptation, coercion and
corruption to strengthen its presence in key positions, to frame debates and control the

discourse, to obtain the support it needs, to impose its agenda and to influence the elaboration and interpretation of international standards.264 Some are punctual operations, such
as paying $1.3 million in bribes to the Antiguan diplomat John Ashe, then president of the
68th session of the UN General Assembly in 2013-2014, and to the Dominican Republic’s
deputy ambassador to the UN, to encourage the two men to help a Chinese entrepreneur, Ng Lap Seng, build a UN-sponsored conference center in Macau (which ultimately
never saw the light of day).265 This was probably not a private initiative, since Ng Lap Seng
is a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Congress, which Peter Mattis
described as “the militia of the United Front.”266
Other operations are more about shaping the world for the long haul. Through the
strength of its financial contributions, China has the means to influence the UN agenda.
For example, it is the only contributor to the United Nations Trust Fund for Peace and
Development, which was established in 2016; it thus occupies four of the five seats on its
steering committee. The steering committee advises the UN Secretary-General on which
projects should receive funding, making it easy for the PRC to lobby for the BRI.267
Through its growing presence in organizations that produce international standards and norms, the PRC has also shown that it has the capacity, and above all the will,
to change the “rules of the game,” to develop a normative power. This is particularly the
case with the concept of human rights, which it seeks to subordinate to the right to state
development (→ p. 216); it is also the case with the responsibility to protect, the norms of
Internet governance, or maritime law – to name but a few examples.
China’s strategy of influence in international organizations therefore takes several
forms, including control of the narratives, for example within the WHO, encouraging
inhibitions, as illustrated by the Human Rights Council, or highjacking the institutions,
the NGO committee for instance. The Party targets not only global organizations but also
regional organizations, as we shall see in the case of the European Union.

1. Controlling high-level positions at the UN
Compared to the other permanent members of the Security Council, especially the
United States (in 2020, out of 170 senior UN positions, three were held by Chinese, compared to twenty or so by Americans268), but also France and the United Kingdom, and even
other large countries such as Germany and India, China has very few staff members in
UN bodies, a fortiori in proportion to its own population and to its ambitions. The reasons
are well known: its late entry into the UN system, the UN bureaucracy, what it may perceive
as cultural differences, its lack of experience on peace and security issues, and the growing
264. After benefitting from Chinese investment, Greece blocked a European Union condemnation of human
rights violations in China in 2017. See Helena Smith, “Greece Blocks EU’s Criticism at UN of China’s Human Rights
Record,” The Guardian (18 Jun. 2017).

distrust it arouses around it.269 There is, however, an exception: China has provided the largest number of interns, in 2018 at least.270 In any case, the quantity or proportion of positions
held is not the only criterion to assess the degree of Chinese infiltration in international
bodies. The nature of the positions must also be considered. In 2017, Liu Zhenmin (刘
振民), a former Chinese vice-minister of foreign affairs, succeeded Wu Hongbo (吴红波)
as the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs,
a position held by a Chinese since 2007. In 2019, Xu Haoliang (徐浩良) was appointed
assistant secretary general at the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
and director of the Bureau for Policy and Program Support. His career at the UNDP began
as early as 1994. Also in 2019, Xia Huang (夏煌), a former Chinese ambassador to several
African countries, was appointed as special envoy for the Great Lakes region, despite
attempts by Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., to block his appointment.271
These positions, in particular in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs
(DESA), provide the PRC with visibility, legitimacy, and a semblance of impartiality that is
very useful to advocate for the Party’s interests, such as promoting the BRI and encouraging more states to join.272 In 2016, DESA published a study, led by a Chinese economist, Hong Pingfan, that showed how the BRI could help the UN achieve its Sustainable
Development Goals.273 For some diplomats, as reported by Foreign Policy, DESA seems to
be nothing more than a “Chinese enterprise” that serves Beijing’s goals of becoming the world’s development leader: “everybody knows it and everybody accepts
it.”274
DESA leaders Wu Hongbo and Liu Zhenmin both used their influential positions to
block the participation of Dolkun Isa, president of the World Uyghur Congress, at the
United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2017 and again in 2018.275
These positions of responsibility allow those who hold them to use the power entrusted to
them to limit the participation of individuals or groups perceived as challenging the
authority of the Party.
Invited on a CCTV program to share his experience with a young Chinese audience,
Wu Hongbo explicitly stated that, as an international civil servant, he has a duty to defend
Chinese interests,276 which is in direct conflict with the norms of conduct of the international civil service, according to which an international civil servant “should not seek

nor should they accept instructions from any Government, person or entity external the
organization.”277 To support his point, he recalled that Interpol had issued a Red Notice for
Dolkun Isa, whom he described as a terrorist. Interpol Red Notices serve as an information-sharing mechanism to facilitate cooperation between police forces around the world,
alerting and informing them of internationally wanted fugitives. Even if they do not constitute arrest warrants, such notices, once made public, can ruin the reputation of the individuals concerned, while the evidence that is supposed to justify such accusations is often not
made public. It is therefore difficult to determine, especially when such charges are pressed
by authoritarian states, whether these red notices are in fact disguised political persecution
of dissidents, journalists and activists. The Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who has promised to bring down the communist regime, is also the subject of a Red Notice.278 Hence
the interest for Beijing to have been able to place in the position of Secretary General of
Interpol, from 2016 to 2018, Meng Hongwei, former Vice Minister of Public Security of
the PRC. But this is a position that China lost following the arrest of the Chinese executive
by the authorities of his own country. The organization is now headed by a German.
Xu Haoliang also sought to promote the BRI within the UN institutions he worked for.
While still the head of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific in 2016, he was
reportedly the one who prompted the then-administrator Helen Clark to sign the first memorandum of understanding between the UNDP and the PRC for a better cooperation in the
implementation of the BRI and the 2030 SDGs agenda.279 It can be noted that at that time,
Helen Clark was campaigning for the position of UN Secretary General and hence sensitive to
Chinese support.280 Regardless of their degree of responsibility, Chinese officials have
shown that they serve above all the interests of the Party, of which they are members.

China headed four UN agencies in August 2021281: the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO). By comparison, the United States, the United
Kingdom and France each head only one agency, the World Bank, the International Labour
Organization, and UNESCO respectively. While leading an agency does not mean having
complete control over it, such a position certainly offers an opportunity to develop influence and have an impact on the interpretation or formulation of the standards produced
by the agency.
As a specialized agency charged with promoting industrial development, UNIDO
assists member states in complying with international standards to export their products,
and it helps develop and form standards in various areas such as quality control, food
safety, environmental impact, and social responsibility.282 In addition to this normative
role, UNIDO promotes technical cooperation among member states and provides pol277. See Article 8, “Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service,” International Civil Service
Commission (2013).

icymaking advice.283 Li Yong (李勇), a former vice minister of finance of the PRC, has
served as the director general of UNIDO since 2013. Re-elected in 2017 for four years,
his term ends in 2021. He was a member of the CPPCC, the supervisory body of the
United Front (→ p. 39) until 2016.284 As head of UNIDO, Mr. Li has created a new
directorate for programs, partnerships, and field integration (which is particularly powerful because it selects countries for partnership programs) and has appointed Ciyong
Zou, a Chinese national, as its director. With no fewer than 19 Chinese nationals serving
administrator positions in this organization, China controls its governance. The same
trend can be observed elsewhere: there is evidence that “agencies headed by Chinese
nationals show faster increases in Chinese staff members in both absolute and relative
terms.”285 Director General Li Yong has more than once expressed UNIDO’s willingness to become more involved in the Belt and Road initiative to “promote and accelerate inclusive and sustainable industrial development.”286 And, in November 2019, he
signed a joint statement with the vice president of Huawei Technologies to strengthen
the partnership between UNIDO and Huawei.
The ICAO works to establish standards, practices and policies in the civil aviation sector
to ensure safety and efficiency worldwide. Liu Fang (柳芳) was the first woman and first
Chinese to be elected to the position of ICAO Secretary General in 2015. Re-elected in
2018, her term ended in August 2021. Liu Fang previously worked for the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC). During her term running the agency, Taiwan was denied
participation in the triennial assembly, despite protests from some countries.287 In 2020,
during the Covid-19 crisis, ICAO came under heavy criticism when its Twitter account
blocked several users who had criticized its policy of excluding Taiwan (→ p. 477).288
The ITU sets standards and regulations for the information and communication technology sector, allocates radio frequency bands and satellite orbits, and assists in the operation of telecommunications services worldwide. ITU standards are frequently adopted in
developing countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, whose infrastructures are often
built by the Chinese. Zhao Houlin (赵厚麟) has served as secretary general of the ITU
since 2015. Re-elected in 2018, his term ends in 2023. He joined the ITU in the 1990s and
served as deputy secretary-general from 2007 to 2015, after working at the PRC’s Ministry
of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Since taking office, Secretary General
Zhao Houlin has more than once emphasized the importance of cooperating with
China, including in its “Digital Silk Roads”289 project. The MIIT, for which he worked
for before joining the ITU, signed a memorandum of understanding with the ITU in May
2017 at the first New Silk Roads Forum.290 Zhao Houlin also stated that he did not consider Huawei’s 5G technology to be a security issue, which has fueled suspicions that the

ITU could facilitate the global adoption of of Huawei’s 5G networks (→ p. 133).291
Indeed, the Chinese company recently proposed to the ITU a new vision of the Internet,
in a radical departure from the representation of networks we have today, and in which
governments would have more control over the Internet.292 China’s position in the ITU also
provides it with the opportunity to negotiate the best possible frequencies and orbital
slot allocations for its Beidou satellite navigation system, and to leverage influence
in favor of Chinese players in the submarine cable sector (→ p. 131).
The FAO sets international standards for food security, assists member states in setting
their agriculture and food policies, and develops international responses to crises in these
areas.293 Qu Dongyu (屈冬玉) is the first Chinese to hold the position of director general.
He was previously vice minister of agriculture and rural affairs of the PRC. Elected in 2019,
his term ends in 2023. Media outlets reported that China had exerted political and economic pressure on other countries to ensure the victory of its candidate: Uruguay,
Brazil, and Argentina were reportedly threatened that they would no longer receive certain
exports from China if they did not vote for the Chinese candidate, and Cameroon withdrew its candidate, Médi Moungui, from the race some time after China quietly cancelled
its $70 million debt.294

3. Leadership positions in other organizations
Former PRC Vice Minister of Commerce Yi Xiaozhun (易小准) is one of four deputy
directors general of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Appointed in 2013, he was
selected again in 2017 for a second four-year term. Xue Hanqin (薛捍勤) became the first
woman and first Chinese to be vice president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
in 2018 for a three-year term. She had been a member of the ICJ since 2010.
Zhang Tao (张涛) has been deputy managing director of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) since 2016.295 A former deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China,
he was the second Chinese national to join the IMF’s management after Zhu Min (朱
民), who joined in 2011.296 Ren Minghui (任明辉) is deputy director general at the World
Health Organization (WHO) in charge of universal health coverage and communicable
and non-communicable diseases. In open access publications, he presented the BRI as an
opportunity to improve global health and China as the country that should take the lead in
this area.297
These examples show how the PRC intends to use the high-level positions it manages to
obtain in these normative institutions to develop a positive vision of China and of its projects,

such as the BRI, to influence the work of these organizations toward its own interests, and to
make them work toward the revision of the international order dominated by the United
States.
However, the PRC does not need to control all the key positions to infiltrate international organizations. It can also use financial contributions: Beijing, for example, is the
largest extra budgetary contributor to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs
(with $575,000, or 44% of voluntary contributions, far ahead of the United States, which
contributes only 24%) to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(with a $1 million grant for five years), as well as the second-largest contributor to the
International Atomic Energy Agency and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
Organization, behind the United States.
Many senior international officials have expressed support for China, often to congratulate, thank or praise its contributions, sometimes even to promote its projects. For
the director general of the International Labour Organization, Guy Ryder, the “very
strong synergies” between the BRI and the 2030 SDGs Agenda should give China, in his
words, “leadership in the multilateral system.”298 In an interview with Xinhua, the president
of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Gilbert Houngbo, praised
the Chinese model for national economies in transition.299 Several other UN specialized
agencies have officially expressed interest in, and support for, the BRI: the International
Maritime Organization and the World Tourism Organization for instance. Others, such
as the International Labour Organization, UNESCO, and the World Meteorological
Organization, have already formalized their cooperation in the BRI with the PRC.300
Despite the aggressiveness of some Chinese maneuvers, they do not consistently succeed. In 2019, former Hong Kong police chief Andy Tsang Wai-hung was unable to secure
the position of head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime he coveted.301
Last year, China failed to win the position of director general of the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO). Wang Binying, WIPO’s deputy director general, lost to
the Singaporean candidate Daren Tang, who had been supported by the United States and
others.302 The possibility that China could get its hands on a fifth specialized UN agency,
especially the one in charge of the strategic intellectual property patents, certainly attracted
more attention and was compared to “appointing the fox to guard the hen house.”303
The former director of WIPO, Francis Gurry, had already been criticized for his secret
negotiations with China and Russia that led to the establishment of two WIPO offices in
these countries.304

With six of the fifteen ongoing terms ending in 2021, Beijing is already maneuvering to
maintain its presence at the head of these institutions and to win new ones.
Furthermore, China’s influence is not limited to UN-affiliated organizations. As mentioned
earlier, Interpol is not protected from potential abuses in the use of Red Notices by authoritarian regimes such as China. The surprise arrest of its former head, Meng Hongwei, the
first Chinese national to head the organization, raised a number of questions about Interpol’s
potential complicity, or at least complacency, with the Chinese government.305 ICANN is
another example: the California-based non-profit corporation allocates domain names and
numbers on the Internet, and it maintains an “unusual” relationship with the Chinese government.306 The decision of its former CEO, Fadi Chehade, to accept to preside the World
Internet Conference, an initiative of the Chinese government, came as a surprise.307 The issue
at stake here, for the Party, is to influence the development of Internet standards. It is also
noteworthy that structures such as the CICIR, a think tank of the MSS, participate in the
World Internet Conference alongside the Cyberspace Administration of China.
China seeks to penetrate and influence as many standards-setting institutions
as possible, regardless of the subject matter. Perhaps more than any other country, it
has the means and the will to train experts to take on more and more leadership positions.
However, China does not need to seize leadership positions in the majority of organizations to achieve its goals – nor does it necessarily have an interest in doing so. It is enough
that the people in these positions support Chinese policies on their own, which often
happens through elite cooptation or political opportunism. These efforts to infiltrate international organizations have allowed the party to silence some criticism, paralyze some
structures and guide the development of international norms.

A former World Bank Chief Executive accused
of having changed China’s ranking in report

In September 2021, the World Bank decided to stop publishing its influential annual Doing
Business report, which since 2003 has assessed the international business environment by
ranking 190 state economies, after irregularities in the 2018 and 2020 editions were reported.308 An independent investigation commissioned by the World Bank has indeed concluded that senior officials at the institution, including its Chief Executive Kristalina Georgieva
(now head of the IMF), lobbied the report’s authors to improve China’s ranking in the
2018 edition.309 Beijing, which is the third largest contributor to the World Bank, after the
United States and Japan, indeed challenged its fall of seven places to the 85th rank in the
report meant to be published in October 2017. The investigation established that, under
pressure from its general management, World Bank teams then changed data to allow
China to retain its 78th place – an intervention that prompted protests and the resignation
of Paul Romer, the World Bank’s chief economist, who now confirms that “Kristalina undertook to doctor the report and cover it up.”310 It is not certain that, in this case, Beijing
intervened directly, and this is precisely what makes it interesting since it could testify to
the internalization of the constraint: the Party-State no longer even needs to apply

cases of self-censorship following pressure not directly from Beijing, but from local actors
fearing the Party’s reaction (→ p. 360).

4. Controlling the discourse: the example of the WHO during the Covid-19
pandemic
China first took over the leadership of a UN specialized agency in 2006 with the election of Margaret Chan to head the World Health Organization (WHO). During her tenure, she was criticized for her lack of diligence in handling the 2014 Ebola outbreak.311
In 2016, she cancelled Taiwan’s observer status following the election of President
Tsai Ing-wen. Since then, Taiwan has been systematically excluded from the World
Health Assembly, WHO’s annual forum. In doing so, the organization has lost valuable
experience, as Taiwan learned a lot from the SARS episode in 2003 during which “Beijing
did not play the game of transparency.”312 In 2017, Margaret Chan was replaced by Tedros
Ghebreyesus, a native of Ethiopia, a country with which China has an excellent relationship. When he was still Minister of Health in Ethiopia, Dr. Tedros – who used his first
name to campaign – was criticized for his handling of several cholera outbreaks.313 Since
his appointment, he has more than once taken a public position in favor of China –
which is the second largest financial contributor to the WHO among the 194 member states, behind the United States only – going so far as sycophancy. 314 In particular, he
praised its handling of the Covid-19 epidemic in January 2020. According to Tedros, the
Chinese government should have been “congratulated” for its management, which reportedly slowed the spread of the virus abroad. He praised China’s “impressive speed” with
which it “detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome, and shared it
with WHO and the world,” but also applauded China’s “commitment to transparency,” and
concluded that China was “setting a new standard for outbreak response.315
In reality, the reverse is more accurate: China tried to cover up Covid-19 at the beginning
of the pandemic. The first cases, which appeared as early as October316, were ignored, as was
the high level of contagiousness, which was established as early as December. Authorities
ordered laboratories to stop testing, to destroy all existing samples, and then to publish nothing on the subject.317 Some hospitals falsified diagnoses.318 Whistleblowers were punished.
Some of them, doctors and journalists, simply disappeared. And while the danger of the
virus was known, the January 18 banquet for 40,000 families in Wuhan was not cancelled. An
Associated Press investigation found that the Chinese government balked for six days before

publicly declaring the coronavirus outbreak. During those key six days, between January 14
and 20, 2020, more than 3,000 people were reportedly infected.319 Concealment of the disease
at a critical moment in its development was costly in human lives: a study published in Nature
estimated that if physical distancing had been implemented one, two, or three weeks earlier in
China, the number of global cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively.320 As is often the case, this concealment was motivated primarily by domestic political
reasons (stability, confidence, and the image of the Party), and only secondarily by the preservation of the country’s image on the international stage.
While it must be acknowledged that China did implement strict containment, controls,
and population monitoring measures to contain the outbreak in the months that followed
the start of the epidemic, this was not enough to set a “new standard” for all, as Tedros
defended. To please Beijing, WHO ignored warning messages sent by Taiwan’s
Centers for Disease Control as early as December 31, 2019 and delayed declaring a
public health emergency of international concern because China opposed it.321 On
January 12, the organization maintained that there was “no clear evidence” of human-tohuman transmission of the virus.322 On January 14, it only hypothesized “limited humanto-human transmission.”323 It was not until January 22, three weeks into the epidemic, and
after China finally agreed to allow WHO experts to visit Wuhan, that the organization
confirmed that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission.324 Then, the WHO
waited until March 11, when Italy had more than 10,000 confirmed cases and its population
was under a lockdown, to finally declare Covid-19 a pandemic. According to the CIA and
the BND, China threatened WHO that it would stop cooperating with the agency’s
investigation of Covid-19 if it declared a pandemic.325 Moreover, while one of the first
steps Taiwan took was to suspend air traffic in order to limit the spread of the virus, the
WHO asserted that there was “no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with
international travel and trade,” and recommended that there be no restrictions on trade or
movement;326 this, again, was a position consistent with the PRC, which then criticized the
United States for banning flights from China.
Controlling and shaping the discourse on organ trafficking
The CCP “oversees the largest state-run organ trafficking industry in the world: almost certainly deriving a large number of organs from prisoners of conscience who are… executed on
demand for paying customers.”327 If this elicited almost no international reaction and if, ironically, China had even helped create the WHO task force against organ trafficking, and placed

a representative of its choice at the head of the Transplantation Society (TTS), it was because
it succeeded in controlling and shaping the discourse on this subject, with three objectives
according to Matthew Robertson: “protect the political security and legitimacy of the regime from the accusation that it systematically exploits prisoners of conscience as an
organ source. The party’s second goal is to ensure the continued availability of transplant organs for members of the party elite. The party’s third goal is to bolster China’s
image on the global stage as a leader in a field of advanced medicine, while maintaining
the prestige and access of Chinese surgeons to Western medical journals, conferences, and
professional societies.”328 And, from this point of view, the CCP was clearly successful: both
the WHO and the TTS helped spread the representation that China stopped these practices in
2015, after which date organ removals are presumably voluntary (despite the fact that Beijing
had been known to falsify data concerning voluntary transplantations).329
Beijing bought the cooperation of executives from relevant international organizations
by convincing them that they were helping China reform itself – a gratifying idea – or that no
one would gain from a scandal; but also with more concrete benefits such as all-expenses-paid
trips to China to visit medical facilities, funding, including indirect funding (the annual TTS
conference is funded by pharmaceutical companies dependent on the Chinese market), or by
“cultivating” certain individuals, helping them to obtain positions, for example.330

When China showed a decline in the number of confirmed cases, the WHO chose to
confirm these figures and again to congratulate the Chinese government,331 although many
voices pointed out that these figures were probably out of sync with reality. The Chinese
government had indeed decided to change its counting method by deliberately ignoring
confirmed but asymptomatic cases.332 U.S. intelligence even believes that China deliberately underreported both the number of sick people and the number of deaths to hide
the extent of the epidemic in China.333 By late December 2020, figures provided by the
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the number of
people infected in Wuhan might have been ten times higher than initially reported (nearly
500,000 instead of 50,000).334 The official death toll (only 4,635) is also surprisingly low for
a country of 1.4 billion people.
This pandemic has at least been able to reveal the extent of the Chinese influence within the WHO.335 The reaction of Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist and
head of the international coronavirus observation mission in China, to a question from
the Hong Kong journalist Yvonne Tong about Taiwan was revealing in this respect. When
she asked him whether the WHO would consider Taiwan as a member state, Aylward,

visibly caught off guard, did not know what to say for almost ten seconds, then suggested
moving on to another question, cut the video call, which was restored a few seconds later,
and finally, when the journalist insisted that he comment on Taiwan’s management of the
epidemic, replied that they had “already talked about China.”336 This denial of Taiwan’s
very existence as a distinct political entity is perfectly in line with the One China policy
advocated by Beijing. Rather than engaging with a government that has proven its ability to handle a health crisis effectively and which has even been praised and held up as a
model,337 the WHO director general accused the Taiwanese government of orchestrating
a racist campaign against him on social networks;338 a campaign that was later revealed
to be another information-manipulation operation presumably conducted by Beijing
(→ p. 474).

5. A Crippled U.N. Human Rights Council
On April 1, 2020, China’s Jiang Duan (蒋端) was appointed to the United Nations
Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Consultative Group alongside representatives from
Chad, Slovenia, Mexico, and Spain for one year (2020-2021).339 The news led to an outpouring of criticism, the decision being compared to making a “pyromaniac into the
town fire chief.”340 Sitting on the consultative group is not a trivial matter: the five members of the HRC consultative group have the power to choose the experts who will
be responsible for investigating, among other things, human rights violations in the
framework of special procedures, and whose impartiality should be beyond reproach.
China will be able to influence the selection of at least 17 experts over the course
of the year, including potentially the special rapporteur on the promotion and
protection of freedom of opinion and expression, or members of the working group
on arbitrary detention. Each member of the consultative group chairs the selection process for at least five terms, and the HRC generally appoints the experts selected by the
consultative group.341 This means that China is likely to succeed in appointing at least five
candidates who meet its criteria.
The Advisory Group should not be confused with the HRC Advisory Committee, which
is the HRC’s “think tank.” The Advisory Committee is composed of 18 “independent”
experts whose role is mainly to produce studies responding to the interests of the HRC.342
These experts are nominated by their respective governments before being elected by the

HRC. The expert appointed by the PRC is a diplomat, Liu Xinsheng (刘昕生), whose current term does not end until 2022.343
China’s strategy in this body is to change the general interpretation of the concept
of human rights to one subordinate to national sovereignty. The two resolutions that
China pushed through at the UNHRC on “the contribution of development to the enjoyment of all human rights” in 2017, and then on “promoting mutually beneficial cooperation
in the field of human rights,” in 2018, actually advocated for a regressive vision of rights.344
This vision promoted by China is positively received by other authoritarian regimes, which
unsurprisingly support a vision that insists on respect for non-interference.345 To build support for its human rights principles, China has already organized two editions of the SouthSouth Human Rights Forum, during which it advocates rights tailored to the regional,
political, economic, social, cultural, historical and religious contexts of different countries;
in other words, a vision that denies the universality of human rights.346
With the adoption of the first resolution in 2017, the UNHRC, at China’s request, solicited the consultative committee to study the extent to which development contributes to
the enjoyment of all human rights by all.347 This is not so much an academic research as a
maneuver to further imprint the Chinese narrative and impose the Party’s agenda on the
work of the UNHRC. The study commissioned by China, chaired by Liu Xinsheng and
whose rapporteur was the committee’s Russian expert, concluded that human rights could
only be guaranteed for all if the state enjoyed a situation of peace and stability, and that the
development and stability of a state was intimately linked to human rights.348 As Andrea
Worden pointed out, this is the kind of narrative that can be easily instrumentalized to
justify violent repressive measures in the name of stability.349 According to the vision promoted by the PRC, the state – rather than the individual – thus becomes the primary
subject of development and human rights.
The PRC also takes advantage of its position in the UNHRC to block any criticism
voiced against its policy, be it about Xinjiang, Tibet, or Hong Kong, and whether the criticism comes from individuals or NGOs. In 2019, Chinese diplomats interrupted the speech
of the Hong Kong activist and singer Denise Ho at the HRC.350 In June of the same year,
China invited a UN counterterrorism official, Vladimir Ivanovich Voronkov, to visit Xinjiang,
thus carrying out a public relations operation: they suggested that Uyghurs were terrorists,
hence legitimizing Beijing’s repressive policy in the region.351 Michelle Bachelet, the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, is still barred from visiting Xinjiang, despite her willingness
to draw attention to the conditions of detention in Chinese camps.352

It should be recalled that the PRC is obviously not the only country undermining the
work of the HRC. Other authoritarian regimes such as Saudi Arabia and Russia have also
held or are still holding key positions in the HRC.353 For that matter, the PRC regularly
seeks the support of these regimes. The difference between China and these regimes is
that China is more active, and it is able to to influence or paralyze the UNHRC and to
change the prevailing interpretation of international norms.
China’s influence at the UNHRC is mainly southern, as Beijing has significant
leverage over the so-called developing countries: on June 30, 2020, a declaration supporting
Hong Kong’s national security law was voted by 53 states (not only the big authoritarians
such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and North Korea, but also all the African members of the council) with 27 opposing it (mainly European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and
Japan). This polarization is clearly visible on the map.

6. A Committee on NGOs diverted from its mission
The Committee on NGOs is a standing committee of ECOSOC composed of 19 members elected for a four-year term, but without a rule limiting the number of successive
terms a member state can serve. China is currently serving for the 2019-2022 term. This
committee has the power to approve – or reject – applications from NGOs to receive the
consultative status that allows them to operate within the United Nations.354 The special
consultative status gives recipients the power to submit written communications as well
as petitions to ECOSOC, and the general consultative status also allows them to propose
items to ECOSOC’s agenda.355 An NGO with consultative status is also able to attend and
organize events, to expand its network, and conduct lobbying activities.356 Conversely, an
NGO denied this consultative status has great difficulties acting within the United Nations
framework.
The PRC has pressured the committee to block or delay granting a consultative status to certain NGOs, particularly those working on human rights, but also all those that
353. In 2015, Saudi Arabia’s presence in the advisory group was also criticized.

do not conform to the position and terminology that satisfies Beijing with regard to Tibet,
an “autonomous region of the PRC,” and Taiwan, a “province of China.”357 By formulating and repeating questions that are often politically motivated or even inappropriate, it postpones the application of some NGOs until the following session – which
means two to seven months later. The PRC then manages to suspend applications. For
example, in January 2013, when the NGO Children’s Rights Network (CRN), which had
applied as early as 2010, was in its fifth round of questioning, the PRC made the following
three requests rather than addressing CRN’s contribution to children’s rights: “1. Please do
the necessary corrections to the organization’s website and publications in order to align to
United Nations terminology when referring to the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. 2.
Please provide a written commitment to respect United Nations terminology when referring to certain regions of China. 3. Please provide what position the organization has with
regards to the question of Tibet.”358
In 2015, the Chinese delegation to the Committee on NGOs attempted to make the
committee’s deliberations even more opaque by proposing not to list the name of the
member states that oppose or question an NGO’s application for consultative status. The
proposal was withdrawn, but nonetheless reflects the PRC’s desire to hide its actions.359
In contrast, Chinese NGOs that are more or less openly linked to the Chinese government and whose objectives are more or less explicitly aligned with those of the Party do not
face as many difficulties in obtaining consultative status with ECOSOC. The China
Foundation for Peace and Development and the China Women’s Development Foundation
obtained it on their first attempt, in 2014 and 2016 respectively, even though they are both
affiliated with the United Front (→ p. 62).360
Nearly 30 Chinese NGOs have been granted consultative status today, including the United Nations Association of China (中国联合国协会),361 the Chinese People’s
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC, 中国人民对外友好协会)362
and the China NGO Network for International Exchanges (CNIE, 中国民间组织国际交
流促进 会),363 which were granted consultative status in 2000, 2001, and 2008, respectively.
The CNIE, which is a coalition of about 30 NGOs founded in 2005, is the Asia-Pacific
regional coordinator of the informal UN-NGO-IRENE network;364 it has openly advocated for stricter Chinese government control over NGOs and considers that there are still
a small number of NGOs engaged in activities that violate Chinese law, threaten China’s
reunification, security, and ethnic solidarity.365 The CPAFFC, meanwhile, is a United Frontrelated organization.366 Other Chinese NGOs with consultative status include the China
Association for NGO Cooperation (CANGO) 中国国际民间组织合 作促进会, or the

China Academy of Culture. Founded in 1992, CANGO was granted the status in 2007 and,
in 2018, it had over 160 members.367 As for the China Academy of Culture, it is the affiliate
organization of the CEFC Huaxin conglomerate, whose links to the PLA were previously
presented (→ p. 116).
Because of their ties to the Party-State, Chinese NGOs are often referred to as
“GONGOs,” an acronym for the oxymoron “government-organized non-governmental
organizations.”368 Rather than representing civil society, Chinese GONGOs such as the
China Association for Preservation and Development of Tibetan Culture (CAPDTC, 中
国西 藏文化保护与发展协会)369 actually advocate for Party policies, which is legitimized by the ECOSOC consultative status. One need only identify the members of the
CAPDTC leadership to gauge its ties to the Party: its honorary chairman, Raidi (热地), and
its president, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai (帕巴拉-格列朗杰), both hold important positions
within the Party. Raidi is a member of the Central Committee and Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai
is vice-chairman of the CPPCC, the body that oversees the United Front (→ p. 39).370
The CAPDTC presents itself as a non-governmental organization promoting the preservation and development of Tibetan culture when, in fact, it serves as a platform to
implement propaganda and intimidation campaigns against all individuals and organizations critical of China’s policies in Tibet. It also undermines the work of NGOs genuinely interested in defending the rights of Tibetans and the preservation of the Tibetan
culture.371

7. Influence on regional organizations: the Chinese-European “friendship”
The CCP’s influence on international organizations also extends to regional organizations
such as the European Union.372 Lacking a seat in the EU, China hopes to infiltrate it
through informal platforms. A study by researcher Jichang Lulu found that the EU-China
Friendship Group (EUCFG, 欧洲议会欧中友好小组), the EU-China Friendship
Association (EUCFA, 欧洲议会欧中友好协会), the EU-China Joint Innovation Centre
(EUCJIC, 欧盟中国联合创新中心), and the Europe-China Culture and Economy
Commission (EUCNC, 欧盟中国经济文化委员会) are all informal Chinese-European
organizations allowing the PRC to surreptitiously turn European elites into instruments
relaying the Party’s propaganda.373
These informal Chinese-European friendship organizations – which Jichang Lulu called
friendship clusters – seek to seduce the European elites in order to cultivate a “docile
neutrality” thanks to “knowledge asymmetry” and “weaponiz[ed] mediocrity.”374

Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT, 中国国际贸易促进委员会),
or even directly to the CCP International Liaison Department and the United Front Work
Department (UFWD).375
The courted elites become potential vehicles for Chinese interests in the European
Parliament. A former British MEP and EUCFA president Nirj Deva is a supporter of
Chinese positions. In 2019, he said he could not think of “one big mistake” that China made
in the last fifteen years, thus endorsing Beijing’s policies as nearly one million Uyghurs were
massively interned in Xinjiang.376 He also took a stand in favor of Huawei and reportedly
urged his fellow MEPs to do the same.377 In 2009, he made a name for himself during the
visit of Rebiya Kadeer, president of the World Uyghur Congress. Addressing the European
Parliament’s Human Rights Committee, she denounced the Chinese government’s mismanagement of the bloody July riots in Urumqi, among other things.378 Nirj Deva replied: “If
the Uyghur language is banned, how come she is fluent in it today?”; “If Rebiya Kadeer’s
rights are indeed violated, how come she could become a member of the Chinese People’s
Political Consultative Conference?”; “If Rebiya Kadeer is indeed discriminated against,
how come she can become one of the richest women in China.”379 These ad hominem
attacks sought to delegitimize her rather than to address the substance of the issues raised.
These questions were actually brought to Nirj Deva by his assistant and EUCFG secretary general, Gai Lin (盖琳), who is of Chinese origin.380 Indeed, he reportedly suggested
the idea to create the EUCFG to Nirj Deva, pointing out that there was an EU-Taiwan
friendship group but none for the PRC.381 He also suggested that the mistrust or even
anti-Chinese sentiment among Europeans was only due to the many prejudices they harbor
toward China.382 Gai Lin is the first EU official of Chinese nationality. He was born in
1981 in Shenyang, Liaoning, and he studied in Belgium. He reportedly first met Nirj Deva
in a bar and was later recruited as his assistant. Deva is said to have made a special request
to the president of the European Parliament to be authorized to recruit Gai Lin.383
In 2006, Gai Lin and Nirj Deva founded the EUCFG with the aim of promoting a
better understanding of China. About 40 MEPs from about 20 countries and seven
different political groups – the list was never disclosed – are apparently members
of this friendship group. About ten of them held key positions such as president of a
political group, parliamentary committee or delegation in the European Parliament.384 The
EUCFG regularly organizes trips to China for its members, including trips to Tibet, while

the European Parliament’s official working group on China still has not been authorized
into the region.385
Gai Lin is the secretary general of EUCFG and of the EU-China Friendship Association.
While the group promotes Chinese-European relations from a political viewpoint, the
association is dedicated to all non-political aspects such as culture, research, tourism, trade,
etc.386 Gai Lin is also associate professor at the School of International Relations at the
University of International Business and Economics and founding president of an association of Northeast Chinese (Dongbei) in Europe (欧洲东北同乡会暨商会).387 This
association, which may have ties to the United Front, has also implemented a campaign to
“present the Chinese experience in the fight against Covid-19” to the health services of the
European Parliament.388
In 2009, Gai Lin published a book about his experience in the European Parliament.389
His personal ambition was to show the “true face” of China, especially with regard to the
situation in Tibet, to MEPs.390 He was pleased with his “achievements”: the EUCFG supported the 2008 Olympic Games in China, but also the Chinese people after the earthquake
in Wenchuan, Sichuan, by collecting tents, and the group was hosted several times by the
highest authorities of the PRC, including then-President Hu Jintao. When the European
Parliament received the Dalai Lama in 2012, Gai Lin strongly criticized this decision by
signing an op-ed in European Voice, as secretary general of EUCFG, in which he urged
Europe to “focus on helping its jobless rather than on Tibet.”391

B. “Wolf-warrior” diplomacy or how to dignify trolling
“Wolf-Warrior Diplomacy” (战狼外交), a name referring to the Chinese blockbuster
Wolf Warrior (2015, 2017 → p. 348), is the diplomatic version of the “fighting spirit” that
Xi Jinping requires not only from the PLA but from all state and Party services, to defend
China’s interests and image abroad. The expression was coined mainly to characterize the
postures of the Foreign Ministry spokesperson’s office and of a dozen diplomats
who, in 2020, responded particularly virulently to criticisms levelled against China during
the Covid-19 pandemic (which focused in particular on the name and origin of the virus,
Beijing’s responsibility in its circulation and on the management of the epidemic in China).
Their aggressiveness was all the more striking because it broke with the discretion that had
characterized Chinese diplomats before.
The attacks carried out by these diplomats have taken relatively classic forms (official
communiqués on embassy websites, official protests via diplomatic channels) but also new
ones, such as social networks and an uninhibited recourse to abuse, admonition

and even intimidation. For example, the Chinese consul general in Calcutta replied to a
Twitter user that he would be “eradicated just like the virus,” or Zhao Lijian, spokesperson
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who posted a photo-montage showing an Australian
soldier cutting the throat of an Afghan child (see image below), which provoked numerous
indignant reactions around the world. This latest image, titled Peace Force (《和平之师》),
is the work of the political artist Fu Yu (付昱), known as Wuheqilin (乌合麒麟), whom the
Chinese media readily portrays as a “wolf warrior artist.”392

The violence of some comments has sometimes led platform moderators to take
action. Twitter locked the official account of the Chinese embassy in the United States in
January 2021 after a tweet describing Uyghur women as “baby-making machines.”
The problem with the term “wolf warrior,” which was picked up in 2020 by the media
and many researchers, is that it helps make attractive a practice that should not be appealing.
Elise Thomas recommended that “we should probably stop using terms like ‘wolf warrior,’
which makes everything sound cooler than it is, for what is essentially just diplomatic trolling.”393
Her analysis is accurate in terms of the informational content, which can be observed on
Twitter especially (from this perspective, the “wolf warrior” diplomacy is a “Twiplomacy”
→ p. 229) – but also during press conferences (during one of them, in July 2020, Zhao
Lijian attacked the German researcher Adrian Zenz (→ p. 53) with what amounted to a
death threat: “what is unjust is doomed to destruction”).394 But the so-called “wolf-warrior” diplomacy is also present offline, in the physical world. In order to exert pressure, silence critics, or impose positions favorable to the CCP, Chinese diplomats use many
tools, of which this report provides examples: letters, phone calls, surveillance, intimidation, and even physical attacks. Indeed, on October 8, 2020, on the sidelines of a
Taiwanese National Day reception in Fiji, two Chinese diplomats assaulted a member of
the Taiwanese Trade Office in Suva who had to be hospitalized as a result, prompting the

On October 7, 2020, about 250 Indian journalists received a letter from the Chinese embassy anticipating
their potential coverage of the “so-called” Taiwanese national holiday that was to take place three days later
(October 10). It reminded them that there was “only one
China,” that Taiwan was “an inalienable part of China’s
territory,” and that this statement was “the long-standing
position of the Indian government.” The embassy therefore expected the media to respect this position, to “not
violate the One-China principle,” and in particular not to
refer to Taiwan as a “country,” “nation,” or as the
“Republic of China;” but also not to refer to the leader
of what is therefore only a “region” as a “president”
(Tsai Ing-wen was not named in the letter). As usual, the
letter ended with a thinly veiled threat: if these instructions were not followed, communication with the media
would be broken off. As is often the case, this initiative
by the embassy proved counterproductive, since one of
the journalists to whom the letter was sent posted it on
Twitter, where he was followed by more than 280,000
persons, and where it was widely circulated, prompting
numerous reactions, including from the Taiwanese
Minister of Foreign Affairs.396 His Indian counterpart responded the next day, explaining that the “free media in
India […] reports on issues that they see fit.”397

Similarly to journalists, politicians are also common targets, especially when they
meet dissidents: in Germany, a meeting between Joshua Wong and Heiko Maas provoked a
sharp response from the embassy.398 Members of parliaments are specifically targeted
by “wolf-warrior” diplomats who do not refrain from calling them, or sending insistent
and threatening letters, particularly when they plan to visit Taiwan, as happened in the
Czech Republic (where the president of the parliament was targeted by a disinformation
campaign → p. 267), or in France, as the following letter testifies. The Chinese ambassador
Lu Shaye wrote to the senator Alain Richard, setting in motion a succession of events that
led the ambassador to insult the researcher Antoine Bondaz and, in fine, pushed the minister
of Europe and Foreign Affairs to summon the ambassador (→ p. 237). Only two days after
the stern admonition from the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs, Lu Shaye
reiterated with a second two-page letter to Alain Richard, dated March 25, this time clearly
threatening retaliatory measures if the trip to the island, which he described as a “rupture”,

was maintained.399 Ignoring the warning he had just received, the Chinese ambassador seems
to prefer provocation and escalation. The visit was not a novel idea however; Alain Richard
already led delegations of senators to Taiwan in 2015 and 2018, such as his counterparts in
the National Assembly did. And the five French parliamentary trips to Taiwan after 2015
had not harmed relations between Paris and Beijing. The Chinese reaction to this proposed
trip, which is no different from the previous ones, is thus symptomatic of the increasing
aggressiveness of the Party-State, particularly on the Taiwan issue.

In the United States, the Chinese Consulate in Chicago tried to pressure state congressmen as well. On February 26, 2020, the office of Roger Roth, president of the
Wisconsin Senate, received an email from a Wu Ting from the consulate asking him to
introduce a resolution praising the Chinese management of the crisis. Attached to the
email was a draft resolution, in which we could read that “China’s action has been critical
to the global fight against the epidemic, and China has adopted unprecedented and rigorous measures… [it has been] transparent and quick in sharing key information of the virus
with the World Health Organization and the international community.” The attempt was
counter-productive because, instead of the resolution proposed by China, Roger Roth
introduced a resolution untitled “the Communist Party of China deliberately and intentionally misled the world on the Wuhan coronavirus.”401
Along with journalists and MPs, researchers are also specifically targeted. The
ASPI, one of the best think tanks in the world in its analysis of the Chinese influence, has
published dozens of excellent reports on the matter, and has thus become a preferred target of Chinese diplomats that described the institution as “[US-funded] anti-China far-right
scholars [that] fabricate[s] fake reports” (see the tweet from the Chinese embassy in the
Netherlands below). The ASPI, more specifically Australian public funding of this institute
presented by Beijing as “anti-China”, was listed among the 14 grievances that the Chinese
embassy transmitted to the Australian press in November 2020.402 ASPI is not an isolated
case. In Canada, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute was also targeted by the Chinese embassy
after it supposedly criticized the CCP.403 In France, the example of Antoine Bondaz,
described later in the report, illustrates the counter-productive character of these attacks
(→ p. 237).

These discursive strategies pertain to what Marc Angenot calls an agonic discourse –
satire, pamphleteering or polemical speeches for instance – of the epidictic genre.404 The
latter focuses on blaming or praising and can have a role in the social construction of a
group. In its typical use, this argumentative strategy is meant to consolidate the unity
of the group, of a nation, in the face of designated enemies. Through such a radical
posture, the goal is to reinforce a divide: those who do not support China are enemies. This
rhetoric highlights the narrative of the Party dedicated to the diasporas about the unfair
treatment suffered by Chinese in the West. Furthermore, it uses modeling, axiological or
deontic discursive markers (injunction, position of authority), and it is tied to eristic – the
“argumentative warfare” which aims to exterminate the adversary and its arguments. To
do this, it resorts to fallacies, to pathos in its vilest form, as well as to invective. The processes are well known: unfounded accusations, argumentum ad baculum (an appeal to force),
“pathos of indignation”, etc.405
The “wolf-warrior” diplomats abundantly use this repertoire of discursive strategies as they condemn Western hegemon, colonialism, even racism; they brandish the
humiliations suffered by the Chinese since the mid-19th century to justify this posture. They
ultimately want the world to understand that the moment when China allowed this to
happen is “over” – something explicitly written by the Chinese embassy in France and the
spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (see below). In a word, the world should
get used to the Chinese power, hence its aggressive behavior (the second being presented as a manifestation of the first), and it should adapt itself accordingly.

Based on this assumption, they disqualify everything that they see as a critic. They refuse
to debate and strive to deprive the adversary of the very possibility to express an opinion,
systematically countering narratives disagreeing with the official CCP line, blurring
the line between what belongs to the CCP and to China as a culture or country. In
this narrative system, the Party represents the whole China and is the depository of the
Chinese culture. This is a renewed version of the rhetoric of the Three Representations (
三个代表) aopted by Jiang Zemin but created by Wang Huning (王沪宁).
Hence, this aggressiveness of Chinese diplomats is at the very heart of the Chinese
Machiavellian moment that seemingly characterizes the current influence policy
of the CCP. The Party’s strategy is apparently based on the idea that seduction is not
enough to reach its objectives. It is then necessary to constrain and intimidate those
who “lower” or criticize China.

1. The origin
While this strategy became widely recognized during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020,
its beginnings could be observed long before, with some particularly aggressive ambassadors already acting as forerunners, starting with Gui Congyou (桂从友) in Sweden
(→ p. 523) and Lu Shaye (卢沙野) in Canada (→ p. 547), both explored in Part 4. Thus,
the trend was not new and the pandemic only acted as a catalyst.
The origin of this aggressive diplomatic posture can be found in Xi Jinping’s decision
to abandon Deng Xiaoping’s 24-character doctrine – often summarized in 4 characters (韬
光养晦), which literally means “hide one’s splendor and nurture darkness”406 but is often
interpreted as to “hide one’s ability and wait for the right moment.”407-408 For Xiang Lanxin
(相蓝欣), the evil came from even further back: the origin of this diplomatic hubris would
be found in Martin Jacques’ 2009 book, When China Rules the World. Jacques was instrumental in popularizing the theory of a superior Chinese model. The great success of the
British author is said to have intoxicated the Chinese leadership, which began to believe
in this hypothesis, especially on the basis of China’s recent economic successes. However,
according to Xiang Lanxin, Jacques’ erroneous interpretation was merely a modern version
of Paul Kennedy’s thesis on “the rise and fall of great powers.”409 Indeed, Xiang believed
that James was obsessed with a culturalist vision of China quite similar to the one that
drove the Jesuits – except that they had a command of Chinese, which Jacques did not. The
British author made China a model by denigrating the West (抑西扬中), leading to a dangerous systemic opposition.410 This interpretation, however, has not convinced a majority
of Chinese intellectuals. Chen Dingding, for example, who is much closer to the authorities, believes that the “wolf warrior” diplomacy is not real, but a narrative produced by the
United States, and particularly its hawks, in order to stigmatize and weaken China.411
Whatever the source from which diplomats drew their intellectual inspiration, it seems
that the new diplomatic tone was initiated by the Chinese foreign minister himself.
Indeed, several media outlets point out at Wang Yi’s response to a question by a Canadian
journalist on June 1, 2016, about the disappearance of a bookseller in Hong Kong’s
Causeway Bay – it presumably served as an inspiration for the diplomats412: “Have you
ever been to China? Do you know that China has helped 600 million people lift themselves
out of poverty? Do you know that China is the second largest economy with a per capita
income of US$8,000? Do you know that China has included the protection of human
rights in its Constitution?”413
406. This if a quote from the Book of Tang (舊唐書).
407. Popularized as the official Chinese interpretation, according to the Pentagon and others, but contested by
Chinese specialists. For our part, we decided to keep a more literal translation, faithful to the classical origin, that
eventually leaves the interpretation to the reader.

Presentation of the “passport” at the premiere of the film Wolf Warrior 2.414

The minister’s “boldness” was widely circulated on Chinese-language social networks;
its popular success and the Party’s tacit approval could have inspired diplomats. When the
“wolf warriors” spoke out during the Covid-19 crisis, Wang Yi was quick to support this
posture: “We will strongly hit back against malicious slander and firmly defend national
honor and dignity. We will lay out the truth to counter the gratuitous smears and firmly
uphold justice and conscience.”415
Even if Wang Yi signaled that a new diplomatic posture was desirable – although
one cannot exclude an intellectual reconstruction after the fact – the expression “wolf
warriors” is not his: it was borrowed from a Chinese film franchise, Wolf Warrior, which
features a Chinese special forces agent rescuing his fellow citizens. It is difficult today to
trace the exact genealogy of the graft that led to describing diplomats as “wolf warriors”:
we simply acknowledge it here and focus instead on the description of the posture in itself.
The parallel drawn between the film and Chinese diplomats is based on the message
conveyed by the work of fiction, which these diplomats supposedly embody today. Indeed,
Wolf Warrior’s motto is “[anyone] who harms China will die, no matter how far they
are” (“犯我中华者虽远必诛”). The message was reinforced by the final scene of the
movie, which revealed a Chinese passport with the following inscription superimposed on
its back: ‘Citizens of the People’s Republic of China: when you are in danger abroad, do not
give up. Do not forget that behind you is your powerful motherland” (see image above).416

2. The Twitterization of Chinese diplomacy
Unsurprisingly, this shift in the habitus of the diplomats has led to an increased
presence on Western social networks, the very ones that cannot be used by Chinese
citizens (especially Twitter). They were even encouraged to do so by Xi Jinping who, in a

2018 speech, urged them to “reach an international discursive power [and] optimize China’s
international communication strategy and posture,” including “telling China’s story well and
shaping a positive national image” and “actively using social media platforms abroad.”417 He
has apparently been heard because, starting in 2019, official Chinese Twitter and Facebook
accounts have multiplied.
Between March 2019 and March 2020, the number of Twitter accounts belonging
to Chinese embassies, consulates, and ambassadors grew by 250%;418 75% of the
162 Chinese government and diplomatic Twitter accounts that the Alliance for Securing
Democracy (ASD) tracks on its Hamilton 2.0 tool were created in 2019 or 2020.419 There
were apparently two turning points prompting the Chinese authorities to respond: first,
the Hong Kong crisis in 2019, which coincided with the creation of a large number of
accounts. Forty accounts were created between September and December 2019, about as
many as Chinese diplomats with Twitter accounts prior to March 2019.420 By the end of
December 2019, the BBC had counted 55 Twitter accounts of Chinese diplomats, embassies
and consulates, the majority of which (32) had been created in 2019.421 Next, the Covid-19
pandemic in 2020, which coincided with another peak in account creation-especially in the
beginning (February-March), when China was implicated (4 in January 2020, 10 in February
2020, 9 in March, 5 in April, 3 in May, and 1 in July),422 as well as with an increase in activity (while all the Chinese diplomatic accounts had accumulated a total of 5,000 tweets in
January 2020, they had nearly 20,000 in April).423 This sudden inflation, which answered two
successive crises, suggests that the Twitterization of the Chinese diplomacy could actually
have been a policy, and a communication strategy more than a series of “decentralized
personal initiatives,”424 even though this last possibility cannot be excluded either.
In this process, several personalities stand out. Zhao Lijian (赵立坚) – the first to open
an account in 2010 as “Mahomet Zhao Lijian” (“穆罕默德赵立坚”425) – was a counselor at
the Chinese embassy in Pakistan at the time. Then several ambassadors created an account,
starting with “small” postings (Wei Qiang (魏强), ambassador to Panama, in October 2017),
later followed by larger ones (Sun Weidong (孙卫东), ambassador to India, in December
2017). Then, in 2019, after China’s diplomatic presence on Twitter was deemed conclusive,
the most important postings joined the social networks: Ambassador to the United States
Cui Tiankai (崔天凯), in July 2019; Ambassador to the United Kingdom Liu Xiaoming (
刘晓明), in October 2019. But they do not all have individual accounts yet (in France, for
example, @AmbassadeChine handles the communication on Twitter).

Not all online diplomats are “wolf warriors”: it depends on their personality but
also on the context, i.e. the host country. For example, in Hungary, the Twitter and
Facebook accounts of the Chinese embassy are less aggressive, because there is simply no
need for it: the Hungarian government has been pro-Chinese since 2010 (→ p. 313). It was
also pro-Chinese during the 2020 pandemic, emphatically thanking Beijing for its assistance. “Given the cooperative approach of the Hungarian government to china in the last
ten years, the Chinese government has no reason to directly influence or actively intervene
in the domestic discourse to change public perceptions. It is the Hungarian government
itself that promotes the success of Beijing in fighting the virus and emphasizes the importance of China.”426

Zhao Lijian (@zlj517), leader of the “wolf-warrior” diplomats
Born in 1972, Zhao Lijian is China’s most active diplomat on Twitter (he is the author of more
than 65,000 tweets published between May 2010 and May 2021), and he has been known for
his undiplomatic style and aggressiveness, especially against the United States. He has become
a “wolf warriors” icon, so much so that his image is most often used to represent the phenomenon, as seen in the illustration below against the background of an image from the film
Wolf Warrior.

In July 2019, while stationed at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, he reacted to international
condemnations of the treatment of the Uyghurs by accusing Americans of being racist themselves. His tweet angered the American elite, including President Obama’s former National
Security Advisor, Susan Rice, who thrust Zhao Lijian into the spotlight. His boldness paid off:
called back to Beijing in the summer of 2019, he was promoted spokesman and deputy director-general at the Foreign Ministry’s Information Department, where he has played a role in
the “Twitterization” of Chinese ambassadors around the world. During the pandemic, he also
spread conspiracy theories about the supposedly American origins of the virus (→ p. 596). He
is considered one of the main figures, and perhaps the leader, of the “wolf-warrior” generation of diplomats.

3. The artificial amplification of diplomatic accounts
Another phenomenon which grew most prominently during the epidemic is the
creation of a large number of anonymous accounts on social media that support the actions of the diplomats. By following 36 Twitter accounts belonging to
Chinese diplomats or ambassadors, the Global Engagement Center (GEC) of the US
Department of State detected a sudden increase in the number of followers after
March 2020, which coincided with Beijing’s efforts to amplify its propaganda on
Covid-19. The average number of daily new followers went from around thirty to over
720, a 22-fold increase. Considering that “many of these new followers were newly created accounts,”427 it apparently indicated the implementation of an artificial network
designed to amplify the messages of Chinese diplomats, a tendency that “intensified from March to May.”428 The GEC coordinator gave as examples two accounts linked
to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, @zlj517, and @spokespersonchn: 3,423 of
their 10,000 latest followers were identical and “nearly 40 percent of the most recent
followers were created in just a six-week period between the 1st of March and the 15th
of April, 2020.”429 Another example: the Twitter account of the Chinese Ambassador in
Hungary, created in October 2019, had 2,137 followers near the end of May 2020, 98%
of them non-Hungarian with an unusually high representation of accounts from the
Middle-East, South Asia, and Africa.430
An analysis of the 828,646 followers of two CCP accounts showed that a large number
of them appeared unauthentic and coordinated, were created in March 2020 and published
on topics linked to four main themes: Covid-19 (conspiracy), Taiwan (independence), Hong Kong (protests), and the United States (anti-racists protests).431 Their
unauthenticity was indicated by: their name (many of them, with numbers, seemed to have
been automatically generated), the time of their creation (in large chunks and at the same
time), their profile picture (stolen elsewhere or unrelated to the account), their language (a
same Twitter account tweeted in three to five languages), their behavior (mostly defensive,
with a high reply rate – in some cases, 65% of tweets were replies – to criticisms of China
usually, and to defend the country), etc.
These followers, with accounts that seemed nothing but fake, are located everywhere
around the world, but disproportionally in Pakistan. It is not surprising considering
that the country served as a trial platform in the early days of the Twitterization of Chinese
diplomacy when Zhao Lijian was posted there.432 The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad was
also one of the first to create an account, which remains one of the most followed accounts
among Chinese diplomatic representations, ahead of larger embassies. Finally, the General
Consul in Karachi, Li Bijian (李碧建) (@libijian2), “has been the CCP’s most active diplomat (by a significant margin) since joining Twitter in January 2020.”433

4. The French Case
France also witnessed a radical mutation of the embassy’s attitude since the appointment of Lu Shaye (卢沙野) as embassador in late July 2019. Earlier, the Chinese Embassy
Twitter account had mostly been diffusing soothing information worthy of a tourism agency,
praising the taste of Yangchun’s noodles, the finesse of plum flower paintings, or the dazzling
colors of the Miao people’s New Year celebrations. Since then, and most specifically (but
not solely) in the context of Covid-19, the embassy has been committed to defending the
Chinese performances in a more aggressive manner, responding to criticisms and reports
or research supposedly conveying an erroneous image of the situation in China: the treatment
of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, religious freedom, or Hong Kong politics for instance.
These narrative strategies are often imparted through intermediaries, as seen previously.
On November 10, 2020, the embassy thus broadcast a video showcasing a French expert,
Pierre Picquart, a regular on the Chinese (and Russian) media where he relays – and provide
a foreign “scientific” veneer to – the CCP’s positions (→ p. 317). This time, his remarks were
ostensibly read out on a teleprompter, which did not fail to provoke reactions.434 Along the
same lines, it published, a month before, a video in which an unidentified Westerner explained
in Chinese that, before visiting China, he held a negative view of the country, which was
taught to him by Western media, but that he had realized how erroneous it was. Furthermore,
a few days later, an interview of Dr. Robert Lawrence Khun, an American investor who
deplored the inability of Western media to understand China, was also posted.

434. For example: Nicolas Hénin on Twitter: “Dear Chinese embassy, the next time you stamp an academic to get
your message across, try to make him a little more comfortable. Right now, he really looks like he has a Kalashnikov
pointed at his head…” (In French: “Dites, l’ambassade de Chine, la prochaine fois que vous tamponnez un universitaire
pour faire passer vos messages, essayez de le mettre un peu à l’aise. Là, il donne vraiment l’impression d’avoir une
kalachnikov pointée sur la tempe…,” https://twitter.com/N_Henin/status/1326124257127112706).

Lu Shaye, a not so diplomatic ambassador
The current Chinese ambassador in France, Lu Shaye, has been known as a “remarkably
undiplomatic,” “combative,” and “vehement” diplomat, “slayer of the press,” even before his appointment in Paris.435 Born in 1964 in the Zhejiang province, Lu started his career at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987,436 among the specialists of the French-speaking world.
With an expertise on West Africa, he was posted to the Chinese Embassy in Guinea, then at the
Department on African Affairs, a directory of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1988-2001). He
was later posted to the Chinese Embassy in France (2001-2003), and again at the Department
of African Affairs, as deputy director (2003-2005). He was appointed ambassador in Senegal
(2005-2009) at age 41, making him one of the youngest Chinese ambassadors, before becoming director general of Africa at the Ministry (2009-2014). He subsequently worked for a year
as deputy mayor of Wuhan (2014-2015), and another year as director of the Bureau of Policy
Research of the CCP’s Central Small Leading Group for Foreign Affairs (2015-2016) – an
important position that gave him access to central authorities. He late became ambassador to
Canada (2016-2019) and to France (since July 2019), with the rank of vice-minister.
Ambassador Lu was noticed in Canada for, among other things, its virulent criticisms of
Canadian media (→ p. 547). After the arrest of Huawei’s executive Meng Wanzhou by Canadian
authorities, and that of two Canadian nationals in China, he personally signed an op-ed in The
Hill Times that criticzed those who seemed to believe that “only Canadian citizens’ freedom
shall be deemed valuable” and accused the country of an arrogant double standard which he
explained to be due to “Western egotism and white supremacy.”437 During a seminar in Ottawa
in May 2019, he defended Chinese supremacy (“a 5000 year old Eastern civilization, [with] a
much longer history than all the exiting Western countries”, which “has realized its modernization and become the second largest economy in the world in only a few decade, while it took
its Western counterpart several hundred years to achieve the same,” etc.).438

In March 2020, the Twitter account of the Chinese Embassy in France “liked” a tweet
asking the “fascist media” to stop “doing propaganda for white supremacy.”439 On April
12, 2020, the embassy put on its website a statement untitled “Restoring Distorted Facts –
Observations of a Chinese Diplomat in Office in Paris,” in French and in Chinese, in which
this “diplomat,” who presumably was none other than the ambassador himself,440 violently
attacked France and spread false information. He notably wrote that the “healthcare personnel at EHPADs [établissements d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes] (nursing homes),
abandoned their duties overnight, collectively deserting and leaving residents to die of hunger
and illness.”441 The statement was meant to show to the French – and to the Chinese – the
superiority of the CCP’s authoritarian regime and to silence the “unfounded” criticisms com435. Keegan Elmer, “China’s ‘Outspoken’ Lu Shaye Leaves Canada to Become Ambassador to France,” South China
Morning Post (10 Aug. 2019); Antoine Malo, “En France, un ambassadeur chinois peu diplomate” (“In France, A Seldom

by their negligence and inability to handle a crisis, were, in some way, responsible for the pandemic. This article was strongly criticized, particularly by the researcher Antoine Bondaz who

The ambassador was urgently summoned by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves
Le Drian on April 14, who expressed his disapprobation.442 The embassy subsequently
removed the incriminated text from its website, but neither Lu Shaye nor the embassy apologized to the French people.
Official declarations posted on the embassy’s website went back to a more conventional
content, and the Twitter account back to highlighting elements of the Chinese “utopia” –
the ambassador simply stressing the good relations between the French and Chinese powers, relying, when necessary, on consensual figures, such as General de Gaulle. And yet, the
admonitions targeting opponents of the “Chinese Dream” who try to raise awareness to

The “Bondaz Effect,” or the demonstration of the perverse effect
of the wolf-warrior diplomacy
Antoine Bondaz is a researcher at the French Fondation
pour la recherche stratégique (Foundation for Strategic
Research – FRS). He is used to denouncing, on Twitter
and in the media, the disinformation and interferences
coming from the PRC Embassy in Paris – which
blocked him on social networks. On March 16, 2021,
he reacted to the publication of a letter from the embassy that exhorted French senators to abandon a
planned trip to Taiwan (→ p. 225). In a tweet, Bondaz
wrote that “this injunction is inadmissible. This is a
characterized interference.”443 The following day, a
spokesperson for the Ministry of Europe and Foreign
Affairs addressed the issue during a press conference:
“the French members of Parliament freely decide when
they want to travel and the contacts they have.”444
When, on March 19, Bondaz relayed this information
on Twitter, the official account of the Chinese embassy
insulted him, calling him a “lightweight.”445
This insult provoked an immediate condemnation from researchers, journalists, MPs, and political leaders – both in France and abroad. The embassy even managed a tour de force:
as François Heisbourg noted, the intervention united the entire “community of French
analysts and researchers,” even those who usually work with the embassy.
To defend itself, the Chinese embassy released a communiqué on March 21, reiterating its message and calling Bondaz “an ideological troll” and a “crazy hyena,”446 while the Global Times internationalized the scandal by publishing, the following day, two articles in English that defended

In only three days, the scandal led to numerous articles in newspapers and Bondaz won more
than 3,000 additional followers on Twitter (not all of them benevolent however), after giving
a number of interviews to newspapers, radio and TV programs. On March 22, the Minister
of Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian, reacted: “[t]he public comments of the
Embassy of China in France and the actions taken against European elected leaders, researchers, and diplomats are unacceptable”; for the second time in a year, he then summoned the
Chinese ambassador to answer for this scandal, as well as for the Chinese sanctions adopted
that very day against several European citizens, including the MEP Raphaël Glucksmann.449
Even the former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, also president of FPI which, as we will
see, usually relays Chinese positions (→ p. 313), distanced himself from the embassy.

Summoned to the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs on March 23, the Chinese ambassador was received by the Director for Asia who told him that “the methods of the embassy,
and the tone of its public communication, are totally unacceptable and cross the line of what is
commonly deemed acceptable for any diplomatic representation, wherever it may be.”450 The
same day, the Global Times dedicated a third article to the scandal, noting that “[the] Chinese
ambassador to France won widespread support from the Chinese public after he pushed back
against radical words and deeds by some French politicians and pseudo-scholars over China’s

internal affairs in Xinjiang.”451 This argument reflects the largely shared interpretation that
“wolf-warrior” diplomats are not looking to please local public opinions, which they
actually alienate with indifference, but to please Beijing by highlighting their individual
actions as good soldiers that do not allow China’s standing to be challenged abroad.
That said, this case exemplifies how counterproductive this has become, both because, as it
hoped to discredit a researcher, the embassy drew more attention to his work – thousands of people who did not know him discovered him and are now aware of the threat of
Chinese influence and of the need to defend Taiwan, especially through parliamentary visits
to the island – but also because, through its brutal and coarse attitude, the embassy lost, or
weakened, some of its partners. These relays might find it more difficult to work with the
embassy in the future. Hence, Pascal Boniface, director of IRIS (→ p. 316), seems to have
admitted that “he could not go on with such a partnership [with the Embassy of China] after
the attacks” against Bondaz.452
This is not exactly a case of the “Streisand Effect” since by attacking Bondaz the embassy did
not seek to prevent the disclosure of information but, like the Streisand effect, it is a case of
a perverse effect as the actions undertaken by the embassy backfired. In the context of
the so-called “wolf-warrior” diplomacy, we can now call this the “Bondaz Effect.”

5. Doubts about its efficiency
This aggressive turn of the Chinese diplomacy was surprising because obviously
counter-productive vis-à-vis the authorities and opinions of the host countries: when
ambassadors, tasked with developing bilateral relations, constantly attack people on social
media or in the press, relations tend to deteriorate, along with China’s image – which
they were supposed to promote in the first place. The Swedish case is telling of this situation (→ p. 523). What shocks and raises questions is that Chinese diplomats do not seem to
understand that this brutal and tactless attitude, which involves calling journalists to
insult and threaten them for instance, does not work in liberal democracies; it even
systematically backfires. More generally, this behavior accelerated a reckoning regarding
the nature of the Chinese regime and the formation of a united front against China.
Now, this situation is paradoxical but not unexplainable. First, it should not be assumed
that China’s behavior is always rational and calculated: it can sometimes result from
an improvisation, and the expression of personalities not primarily swayed by particular
policies. In this case, however, the “wolf-warrior” diplomacy seems to be a willing Chinese
policy: its implementation is simply more or less skillful from one country to another. Then,
diplomacy is not conducted by diplomats but by the Party: the diplomatic apparatus
and personnel are subordinated to it, just like the rest of the state. In other words, the
Party sees the diplomats as its spokespersons, which can generate discrepancies, if
not tensions, among them. Finally, it is paramount to understand that pleasing foreign
publics is less important than pleasing Beijing. It is, as Camille Brugier explains in an
IRSEM note, an “external policy for internal use [whose] main purpose is to legitimize the CCP in the eyes of its own citizens.”453 Moreover, Chinese diplomats do not
hide it: “The standard for evaluating our work is not how foreigners see us but how people

in China see us”, explains Lu Shaye.454 The people and especially the Party: the diplomats
are ambitious individuals who hope that their aggressiveness will be perceived in
Beijing as a show of loyalty, hence helping to advance their careers. Many precedents
seem to validate this idea, with the most famous case being that of Zhao Lijian, who was
propelled deputy spokesperson from his position as counsellor at the embassy in Pakistan
(→ p. 232).455 This rationale is not specific of diplomats and, in fact, also applies to zealous students on campuses, for instance; something that Clive Hamilton highlighted: “it is
important to remember that Chinese nationalists who engage in patriotic attacks overseas
are lauded in China and rewarded for their patriotism.”456
That being said, Beijing sometimes acknowledges going too far and, in certain cases,
even apologizes. When in February 2020, Dai Yuming, a chargé d’affaires at the Chinese
Embassy in Israel, compared the Covid-19 pandemic to the Holocaust following the suspension of air connections between the two countries (“In the darkest days of the Jewish people,
we did not close the door on them. I hope Israel will not close the door on the Chinese”), a
comparison that stirred outrage in the country, the embassy eventually apologized.457
More generally, the important cost of these positions – the overall deterioration of
China’s image across the world and the measures taken to counter its ambitions – generates
an internal debate. The “wolf-warrior” diplomacy divides and creates unease among
parts of the Chinese diplomatic elite. This is illustrated by the division between those,
on the one hand, who claim this name – which originated in China and was not imposed
from abroad – and those, on the other hand, who criticize it as if it were an insult. As such,
an article from the People’s Daily, explained that, on December 5, 2020, at Renmin University,
Le Yucheng (乐玉成), deputy minister of foreign affairs, “rejected the criticisms according
to which, Chinese diplomats engaged in the ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy, affirming that the
word was only another version of the ‘China threat theory’ and a rhetoric trap aimed at preventing China from retaliating when its dignity and interests are affected […]. The ‘coercive
diplomacy’ label cannot be pinned on China,” he repeated. “It is not China who coerces
others, but some countries who accuse China of engaging in ‘coercive diplomacy.’”458
A widely discussed article by Colonel Dai Xu (戴旭) noted that “wolf warrior” diplomats have reinforced China’s isolation – and this, despite the fact that the Trump administration sparks rejection– and he concluded that this strategy was mistaken.459 This assessment
of China’s growing isolation risks solidifying even further with the Biden administration and
its emphasis on reconstructing the global image of the United States and building a diplomatic
front against Beijing. Hence, it is not surprising that this “wolf warrior” posture was stopped
or, at least, put on hold to give time to reassess it. This new approach seemed confirmed,
454. Lemaître and Guibert, “L’ambassadeur de Chine en France.”
455. Other such examples include that of Lin Songitian, who was noticed when he was ambassador in South Africa,
when he vigorously opposed a visit of the president of the exiled Tibetan government, and who, in May 2020 – perhaps
as a reward for his attitude – was named president of the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign
Countries (CPAFFC); Lu Shaye as well (→ p. 235), the very vehement – particularly since the Huawei affair – former
ambassador to Canada, who was named Ambassador to France with a protocole rank of deputy minister. Note that the
actual weight of his behavior in Canada in the decision to appoint him in Paris is difficult to evaluate, and it may have been
less important, in fact, than his previous functions within the Central Small Leading Group for Foreign Affairs.

according to Bill Bishop, by the moderate Chinese reaction – particularly that of Wang Yi – to
the closing of the Houston consulate, in July 2020,460 when many observers expected a vigorous reaction from Chinese diplomats. It could also explain the more moderate discourse of
the ambassador in France, Lu Shaye, between its convocation in April 2020 at the Ministry of
Europe and Foreign Affairs and that of March 2021.
Other Chinese voices have criticized this diplomatic hubris, including Yuan Nansheng (
袁南 生)461 who, taking heeds from a book by Jared Diamond, believed that the simultaneous confrontation with several countries can only lead to the failure of the diplomacy led by the Party, which might be overestimating its capacities. Yuan listed historical
examples of a confrontation with several opponents that resulted in a general collapse:
Napoleon, the Qing dynasty, and more notably a militarist Japan during the 1930s.462 Xiao
Gongqin (萧功秦)463 took up this comparison with Japan, explaining that it was the excessive southern expansion of the Japanese Empire that led to a war with the United States.464
He also highlighted the limits of rationality in the succession of decisions that led to the
confrontation.465 Yan Xuetong (阎学通)466 used another comparison: the Cold War. He
presented it not as a “neither war, nor peace” period, but rather, as a specific form of
conflictuality by proxy (代理人战争). Hence, he believed that if a new cold war were to
emerge, it would hinder China’s policy of “national rejuvenation.”467
The internal debate continues. On July 14, 2021, at a seminar organized by the Beijingbased think tank Center for China and Globalization (CCG),468 Chu Yin (储殷) of the
University of International Relations (国际关系学院), also took freely critized what he
described as the trap (陷阱) of “external propaganda modeled on internal propaganda” (宣内宣化). He noted that China needs to pay “special attention to the differences in environment, context, industry, and norms of communication, and pay attention
to the difference between internal and external propaganda.”469 His approach is similar to that developed by Zhang Jian (张建), a researcher at the Shanghai Institutes of
International Studies (SIIS – 上海国际问题研究院), at a seminar organized by SIIS and
ILD on Xi Jinping’s thinking on diplomacy and published in The Paper (澎湃新闻), a newspaper controlled by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee.470 Zhang thus argues that

All these voices warning the Party of an incoming danger essentially compare the CCP’s
situation to the hamartia described by Aristotle in his Poetics – this mistake that constitutes
the triggering act of the downfall of the tragic hero. But despite these warnings, there
is no sign that this strategy may be abandoned.
If the Covid-19 epidemic revealed this posture to the world, the evolution of Chinese
diplomacy stems from a slow transformation that has been propelled by the progressive
reckoning, among Chinese leaders, of their newly-found power.473 In fact, it seems that
no directive signaling a change in the diplomatic strategy has so far been penned. On the contrary, several organs and actors of the Party reasserted that this stance was not only legitimate
but efficient. The Renmin Ribao thus published an article on August 10, 2020, that highlighted
the altogether positive results from the campaign led by the diplomats during the first phase
of the epidemic: “During the coronavirus epidemic, some countries ‘stigmatized’ China, and
attempted to ignore their own responsibility – hence not doing enough to fight the epidemic
– in order to make China a ‘scapegoat.’ [In response, we] launched a public opinion campaign
with a very visible banner, we refuted them with reasoned arguments, we exposed their lies,
and we let the world see their despicable actions and ugly faces.”474
An interview of Le Yucheng, published on the Guancha website on August 12, 2020,
confirmed the sentiment evoked by the Renmin Ribao: the wolf-warrior diplomacy will
not stop, and is here to stay.475 The statements of the minister carried more weight knowing that they were in line with what Wang Yi and Yang Jiechi said on August 6 and 7 respectively. Le Yucheng’s central argument was that the guilty parties are in Washington, not in
Beijing: “[the] series of measures recently taken by the United States against China aim to
fuel an ideological confrontation, and rekindle the Cold War for the 21st century. We get the

feeling that the ghost of McCarthyism is resurfacing in the United States. During the 1950s,
when the United States fell for an anticommunist hysteria, tens of thousands of members
of the Chinese community were suspected of being ‘spies.’ More than 20 million people
had to go through ‘controls.’ Even three-year-old children had to sign a ‘loyalty oath.’ The
expression, ‘find reds under the beds,’ was coined to describe this insane paranoia […].”476
In a word, Beijing is aware of the ambivalent results of its “wolf-warrior” diplomacy,
which is “both criticized and saluted in China.”477 This is contradictory since it is presented “both as the fruit of the imagination of the Western discourse on the Chinese threat
but also as a response to this threat.”478 This inconsistency is well illustrated by a particularly
confusing tweet from the Chinese embassy in Ireland, which on March 31, 2021, sought to use
the fable “The Wolf and the Lamb” to justify the “wolf warrior” diplomacy (images below).

On the left, two tweets published on March 31, 2021 by the Chinese embassy in Ireland and that have since been deleted.479 They
illustrated the confusion in Beijing toward the “wolf-warrior” concept – which was both revendicated and rejected here. The post
from the embassy led to an immediate outpouring of mocking tweets such as those presented above (on the right), confirming
the counterproductive nature of such actions.480

Now, there is no reason to believe that this posture could disappear. It will more
probably last, alternating between varied degrees of aggressiveness. Beijing also
appears to seek to diversify its repertoire of actions. Diplomats will continue fighting
on social media to impose the Party’s narratives and admonish those identified as enemies,
but will also likely try to build coalitions and lean on front organizations to create a buffer

space; their mission will ultimately be to weaken the unity of targeted societies, particularly
the United States. The risk for Beijing is twofold. On the one hand, it risks falling into
a “rhetorical trap” that would cause it to lose control of the consequences of the actions
of some of its diplomats. By not disavowing them, even when they go too far – because this
would cause it to lose face and, above all, would give the impression that there are dissonant
voices within a Party that would thus appear to be weakened – the Party-State could be
caught up in a dangerous spiral. On the other hand, Beijing risks increasing the
internal divisions between the moderates who, as we have seen, condemn the increasing
aggressiveness of the diplomats and plead for more restraint, and the radicals, who are
in overdrive and criticize the Party for not going far enough. This is the case with the most
nationalistic fringe of the Chinese public opinion, which is already disappointed when the
authorities do not react strongly enough to what they consider to be provocations. Thus,
when in June 2021 Beijing reacted in a relatively restrained way to the visit of U.S. senators
to Taiwan, some Internet users on Weibo criticized Chinese officials (“weak and incompetent”), criticizing their lack of firmness (“Why didn’t we shoot them down? They violated
our air space”).481 Caught between two fires of its own making – on the one hand, the
international community and moderates who denounce the aggressiveness of the Chinese
discourse and, on the other, the more nationalistic people who push for escalation and will
not accept any retreat – the Party has condemned itself to being disappointing.

IV. The Economy
Economic pressure is undoubtedly one of the main levers of China’s coercive diplomacy; it is also, therefore, the most studied and best understood by observers of all stripes,
whether they focus on the harmful effects of debt, commercial pressure exerted against
states, companies or individuals to achieve political objectives, or on the “capture of economic elites” by the Party-State. The preceeding overview of the literature has led us to a
less in-depth treatment of this tool of influence in favor of others – information manipulation, for example – which seem to us to be all the more dangerous because they are less
adequately identified or studied.
Economic leverage is notably important, primarily due to the size of the Chinese economy and the asymmetry of Beijing’s relations with most countries. Because it is the second
global economy, with a GDP standing at $14 trillion, but also the first exporter and second
importer of goods in the world, it is difficult to resist when China offers trade and investment deals to countries that need them or when it threatens to reduce trade exchanges,
even among the richest countries. Beijing is the most important creditor among poor
countries. Apparently free, Chinese aid is actually conditional on the non-recognition
of Taiwan, in the first place, but also on the obligation to “use Chinese companies.”482
Loans are also particularly opaque. A 2021 study of 100 contracts between state-owned
Chinese entities and public borrowers in 24 developing countries from five continents
found, among other things, that loan contracts contain unusual confidentiality clauses
and other measures that allow “the lenders to influence debtors’ domestic and foreign policies.”483
In September 2021, an analysis of 13,427 Chinese development projects conducted by
AidData, a research center of a U.S. university, concluded that, overall, China spends
about $85 billion a year on international development, twice as much as the US,
but that, since the launch of the BRI, this has been mostly in the form of loans (with a
ratio of 31 loans to 1 aid grant), thus creating debt.484 “Between 2000 and 2018,” recalls
researcher Thierry Vircoulon, “50 out of 54 African countries borrowed from China in
various forms. In 2018, the PRC held nearly 21% of the continent’s outstanding external
public debt.”485 AidData’s study concludes that 42 states already have a Chinese public
debt that equals over 10% of their GDP. But it does not stop there: for a variety of reasons, including the opacity of agreements with Beijing, the actual debt is not always clear in
the public accounts of these states – in fact, according to the study’s authors, the “hidden
debt” tied to the BRI would amount to $385 billion. These figures must be used with
caution however, as they may be subject to conscious or unconscious manipulation – the
researcher Thierry Pairault reminds us that the weight of Chinese debt varies from 13% to
60% of the stock of long-term debt among sub-Saharan African countries, depending on

the definition adopted, particularly if private debt is taken into account.486 Nevertheless, it
is clear that loans are now one of China’s instruments of influence in Africa and “those
who refuse to see the strategic dimension of Xi Jinping’s New Silk Roads are acting in bad
faith,” as Jean-Pierre Cabestan explains, adding that, “by multiplying the links of economic and financial dependence between an ever-increasing number of countries in the
South, China has set up new asymmetrical and, so to speak, tributary relationships
that represent a new form of hegemony.”487 Some do not hesitate to describe the effects
of the BRI in South Asia as a form of “neo-colonialism,” evoking “the way in which
the financing of infrastructure via loans outside the rules of the market allows Beijing to
monopolize the economic assets of a state.”488
The economic dependence toward China is, more often than not, the first tool
leveraged by Beijing. The latest Chinese five-year plan, approved in March 2021, adopts
a strategy of “offensive decoupling” which consists in making itself less dependent
from abroad while increasing the global dependence on China, which would mechanically increase the economic leverage, and therefore the influence, of the Party.489 Beijing
takes advantage of this strategy by emphasizing bilateral relations, especially in Europe,
so as to impose itself more easily.
The use of economic pressures can also be explained by their greater acceptance on
the international stage. Although it reveals a certain contempt for their trade partners and
comes with “detrimental aspects” (due to the opacity of the deals, the resulting dependence, and the corruption stemming from them),490 these methods remain less intrusive
than other instruments of the repertoire of active measures, such as subversion and
disinformation. Finally, and it is far from negligible, they are formidably efficient.
The Chinese economic coercion takes vastly different forms491: denial of access to
the Chinese market, embargos, trade sanctions, restrictions on investments, quotas on the
number of Chinese tourists in regions dependent on them, popular boycotts – all actions
that have targeted numerous countries in the last few years, particularly Japan, South Korean
and now Australia.
The Beijing-led trade war against Canberra is unprecedented, with sanctions targeting seven lines of goods (coal, beef, wood, wine, cotton, barley, and lobsters) and which
could be extended to others later on (i.e. wool, sugar, or wheat). This, however, is only the
tip of the iceberg and, against Australia, Beijing employs many tools from its repertoire of actions: trade sanctions; threats to lower the number of Chinese students and
tourists; extremely violent attacks on social media (with the infamous photomontage posted
by the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs of an Australian soldier
slitting the throat of a little girl → p. 223); legal proceedings to muzzle critical voices (lawfare); blocking Australian ships in Chinese ports (“dozens of container ships were unable

sending “long-range missiles” to Australia493); even the abduction of Australian nationals
as part of the “hostage diplomacy” (→ p. 411). By deliberately leaking, in November 2020,
a one-page document that listed 14 recriminations presented as the origin of the bilateral
tensions to Australian media, the Chinese embassy in Canberra implicitly admitted to
be in a logic of retaliation, and made Australia an example for the region and for the
world. The Australian case is a message to states and businesses around the world: “China
has chosen Australia as a kind of scapegoat to show Westerners what it might cost them
to criticize the Middle Kingdom too much,” analyses economist Philippe Chalmin.494 That
said, it is not the first such case (when the South Korean government decided to deploy
the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system on its soil in 2017,
it was targeted by a wave of cyberattacks that did not spare the business sector495). And it
won’t be the last. This trend should worry European countries as they could be targeted by those same practices in the future496.
Economic sanctions are sometimes taken in isolation, but they are, more often than not,
associated with diplomatic or political sanctions. France was targeted in 2008-2009,
after Nicolas Sarkozy conditioned his participation in the opening ceremony of the Olympic
Games on a renewed dialogue between Beijing and the Tibetans, and after announcing that
he would meet with the Dalai Lama.497 In response, the CCP deployed political sanctions (it
postponed the 11th annual EU–China Summit, which was supposed to be held in Paris, the
Chinese minister of foreign affairs refused to receive the French ambassador, even though
the Chinese ambassador in France continued to meet with Bernard Kouchner), and economic ones (it cancelled an order of 150 Airbus airplanes, but also excluded France from
any trade deal for many months). All of this aimed to make France give in.

A. Economic pressures on foreign companies
Chinese economic pressures do not solely target countries, but also companies and even
individuals. Beijing increasingly requires censorship as a condition to access its market. And many companies eventually crack under the pressure: Mercedes-Benz apologized for quoting the Dalai Lama,498 and Zara, Qantas, Marriott and Delta Airlines altered
the way they named Taiwan when Beijing used “economic blackmail” against them.499 Coach,
Givenchy, and Versace were also targeted by attacks on social networks because they presented Taiwan as a country on their clothes or in their advertisements; they all eventually cave

Administration of China (CAAC) sent a letter to 44 airplane companies, asking them to specify, in all public communications, that Taiwan was part of China, threatening them of retaliatory measures. A few weeks later, two dozen of them had already complied.501 Beijing tracks
and condemns all mentions of Taiwan in the companies’ communication, which, in
general, all end up submitting to the pressure, and present apologies that the Chinese
media relish in relaying, such as the Global Times on February 13, 2021 with an apology by the

Likewise, the Party used economic pressure in the Xinjiang cotton controversy. In
March 2020, ASPI published a report revealing the extent of the forced labor system put
in place by the Party against Uighurs locked up in camps.502 The Australian think tank identified 27 factories in Xinjiang and in 9 other provinces that used Uighur forced laborers.
These factories were included in the production chain of 82 foreign companies, including Volkswagen, Lacoste, Nokia and Alstom. Following the revelations, some companies,
including Nike, Adidas, Uniqlo and H&M, stopped buying cotton from Xinjiang that was
the product of forced labor and publicly stated their motivations.503 They then became the
target of a smear campaign, led in particular by the Communist Youth League on Weibo
(with the slogan “Xinjiang cotton doesn’t eat this!” – see below). Beijing took additional
retaliatory measures, removing the products of the brands concerned from online plat500. Iain Robertson, Chinese Messaging Across the Strait: China-friendly Narratives and the 2020 Taiwan Presidential Election,

forms, calling for a boycott of physical stores and blurring their logos on television. This
campaign, which aimed to defend Chinese cotton and criticize those who “attacked China,”
seemed to have been motivated less by the decision of these companies, which dated back
several months, than by the need to respond to the growing criticism and sanctions taken
by the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union.504

Economic sanctions targeting professional sports are a common CCP practice.
In 2004, the NFL suffered its wrath for accepting the diffusion of a clip in homage to
freedom that included a picture of the Tank Man near Tian’anmen Square in 1989. This
“incident” led China to sanction the NFL by canceling all game broadcasts in China for
a year.505 If basketball is by far the most important sports market, other big professional
sports’ leagues bet on Chinese consumers and are, for that reason, particularly sensitive to
economic sanctions. The baseball (MLB) and ice hockey (NHL) leagues have both signed
game broadcasting contracts with Tencent for instance.

The case of the NBA
On October 4, 2019, during the Hong Kong protests, Daryl Morey, the general manager of
the Houston Rockets, a member of the American National Basketball Association (NBA),
retweeted a picture that read: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.” The Party’s sanction was immediate, and all the stronger due to the fact that Houston welcomed the star of
Chinese basketball, Yao Ming, from 2002 to 201, and because it was the second most-liked
team in China.506 As a retaliatory measure, the NBA’s Chinese partners suspended their
ties with the American basketball league. Daryl Morey’s apologies were not enough to
assuage Beijing’s anger and Chinese media outlets announced that no pre-season game would
be broadcast on their channels. In the end, Tencent (the leader on that market) was allowed
to broadcast a short summary of the games. This late loosening of the restrictions was most
likely meant to avoid sanctioning the Chinese companies for whom the NBA represented an
important source of income.507
NBA games were eventually broadcast again on Chinese television on October 10, 2020, after
a year of purgatory, but the reasons behind this return to grace are unknown. CCTV declared
that the NBA had made a show of “continual goodwill” (持续表达的善意) and had expressed its support to China during the fight against the Covid-19 epidemic.508 We can assume
that the dissatisfaction of the Chinese public may have influenced the decision as well, even
if Sup China highlighted a notable discontent among the most nationalist fringe of the population regarding the decision to resume broadcasting.509 Besides, on October 16, Daryl Morey
announced his resignation from his position at the head of the Houston Rockets, presenting
this decision as personal, although we can imagine that both the owner of the team and the
NBA were in favor of this “solution.” On the Chinese side, even if CCTV remained polite (yet
slightly ironic), the Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao), did note that many Chinese fans believed that
Morey only got what he deserved.510

“What good would it do to interfere in Germany? Its leaders are fully won over, China
is in conquered territory”: these words, from one of the officials we met in Berlin, adequately illustrate the current mindset in Germany. Many of them, referring to “absolute
naivety” or to a “cognitive bias” have confirmed this substantive tendency: the attitude of
the German authorities and of the business sector have largely been directed by the weight
of the Chinese economy in the German trade balance. In 2020, for the fifth year in a row,
China was the main German trade partner (first importer and second export market for
German goods511). This long-standing partnership (that debuted at the end of the 1980s)
constitutes the original bias explaining the benevolent stance of economic and political
leaders in Germany. Even if the economic partnership is increasingly perceived as asymmetrical by German companies, it is maintained by the strong personal links established
between the German employers and senior executives (the top 100 or 50 of the DAX

companies’ executives) on one side, and Chinese actors, who manage to bring a majority of
German entrepreneurs to interiorize the CCP’s narratives, on the other.512
The dominant idea, at least until the KUKA case,513 is the win-win deals stuck between
the two economies, dominated by very positive representations of China among the companies and the representatives of different professional associations. The alarm bells that
rose from other countries like Australia regarding the risks of dependency toward
China and the latter’s subsequent infringements of the sovereignty of these states
have been largely ignored.
Several events nonetheless affected the pro-Chinese stance of the economic and political actors in Germany514: KUKA’s purchase by Chinese investors in 2016, which opened
up the debate on the role reversal between Chinese and German economic actors, the
latter becoming the targets of China’s predation; the publication of the program Made in
China 2025, which revealed the true strategy of the regime in many key technologies; the
gradual realization of the actual role of the CCP’s correspondents in Chinese companies,
which is becoming more tangible for expatriate German managers through their increasing
involvement in the strategy and in the internal life of the company; the action of Chinese
representatives in standardization committees; or, the evolution of the internal balance of
power inside the CCP.
Regarding the latter, several German experts believe that the concentration of power in
China tends, in fact, to numb its system. According to them, the regime needs to propose a
new political offer to its population, or at least a symbolic alternative: the representation of
a superior Chinese system. It is the temptation of “Cosmological Communism” exposed by
Didi Kirsten Tatlow.515 The exposure (if not overexposure) of the German economy
to the Chinese market is the first variable of Berlin’s policy vis-à-vis Beijing, and it
explains the moderate stance of the German chancellor, who is the main spokesperson of
her business community.
The business community in Germany has undergone a significant change: it is
now divided between long-homogenous actors seeing China as an exceptional market,
without any alternative, and companies that chose to remain careful and vigilant. The BDI
report published in the fall of 2019 was the translation of that mood change among a number of German managers. With the publication of the Made in China 2025 strategy, they
became aware that China hopes to eliminate German industries from key sectors,
rather than pursuing the cooperation. Sensing the tide turning, Beijing is redoubling
its efforts to influence not only business leaders and politicians but also public opinion,
by recruiting communication agencies and local lobbyists.516 But its attempts are not
always skillful, and at the same time there is a growing awareness in Germany (as in France
→ p. 640) of the extent of Chinese influence operations, thanks in particular to some
in-depth investigations in the press, including a particularly detailed article published in Die
Welt in June 2021.517

from poverty in record time. Another such discourse highlights the “efficiency of the CCP in the coronavirus epidemic
management.”

According to a 2019 study, Germany was host to 190 Chinese groups with direct links to
the UFWD, about 80 CSSAs in the universities, more than 20 Confucius institutes and classrooms, a dozen Chinese-speaking medias “aligned with the United Front” and an unknown
number of “Chinese help centers” (华助中心). In total, Didi Kirsten Tatlow estimated
that “there are hundreds of groups working in Germany to maintain the CCP’s ideology,
values, language and goals to varying degrees among a relatively small Chinese diaspora,
and, importantly, more broadly in the society from the grassroots to the elite.”518 Germany
is also a European base: for instance, the Federation of Chinese Professional Associations
in Europe (FCPAE, 全欧华人专业协会联合会), a United Front organization, is based in
Frankfort and operates everywhere in Europe.
The China Brücke
The China-Brücke (“bridge” in German) was created by Hans-Peter Friedrich, a former minister for agriculture (CSU), who was removed from the Merkel government in 2014 over his
involvement in information leaks on an ongoing criminal investigation regarding an SPD MP
suspected of pedophilia. Friedrich may be considered as very close to the business sector. The
China-Brücke is a forum for dialogue between the (mainly) Chinese and German economic
elites, tasked with improving the knowledge of China among German decision-makers. It is
set on promoting “exchanges between actors from the political, economic, scientific, civil society and cultural sectors regardless of ongoing political events.”
The composition of its executive board is telling. It includes the former SPD MP Johannes
Pflug, now China-Beaufragter (in charge of the relations with China) for the city of Duisburg
(often seen as the front door of Chinese influence in Germany, and a hub of the Chinese
presence in the Ruhr); Carsten Senz, the head of corporate communications at Huawei
Deutschland; along with SAP and Alibaba managers.519
Created in early 2020 on the model of the Atlantic-Bürcke, which was very active in GermanAmerican lobbying, the China-Bürcke strives to leverage influence in the business sector. Most
of its manifestations (conferences, meetings behind closed doors) remain out of sight, although it should be said that the health situation put a stop to the network practices, in Berlin
as elsewhere.

C. CCP agents lobbying from within Western companies
In December 2020, a document presented as a leak from the CCP, and containing a register of two million Party members, was made public by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance
on China (IPAC), which gathers about 150 MPs from a variety of countries who hope to
change the relationship between democratic countries and the PRC. The document had
supposedly been passed on to the IPAC that September by a Chinese “dissident” whose
identity is not known. The IPAC then transmitted the register to four media outlets after
prookchecking it. The register apparently dated from 2016 and seemed to comprise members of the Party’s Shanghai committee mostly, mentioning their positions within the Party,
their birthdates and their ethnicities; it was divided into 79,000 branches, of which many
were affiliated with private companies.520

The list of Party members contained the name of individuals working for prominent companies such as Volkswagen, HSBC, ANZ or Boeing. The latter counted, at
the time the list was compiled, 287 employees who were CCP members in its 21 branches
in China; Qualcomm, an American company making processors (among other things)
had 229 Party members in its ranks; Hewlett-Packard employed 390 CCP members in 14
branches in China; Volkswagen, on its part, listed over 5,700 employees as members of the
CCP in 131 sites. Other sensitive sectors appeared on this list, such as pharmaceutical
companies: Pfizer’s branch in China, Pfizer Investment Co, counted 69 members, while
AstraZeneca employed 54. The register also included scholars, particularly in Australia
and the United Kingdom, and an executive at the British Consulate in Shanghai.521
Belonging to the CCP does not mean that these individuals were Chinese spies ipso facto,
or that they even collaborated with the Party. Many employees of big companies conduct
political activities, alongside their careers. It is not necessarily incompatible. In China, as we
mentioned with the LJC (→ p. 72), adhering to the CCP can constitute a career accelerator,
and is often the main motivation of the inductees. The issue – and in that, the Chinese case
differs from that of democracies – is that the affiliation of these individuals constitutes
a leverage that the Party can use to demand information on their employers. Some
could even be tempted to volunteer information to the CCP to get favors, increase their
influence in the Party, or even accelerate their careers (and so on).
The Global Times quickly countered the media’s revelations. The Chinese daily used a
classical discursive method and spoke about the “alleged list of CCP’s members.” “Alleged”
in this case, is meant to discredit the other’s argument, or the proof put forward to cast
doubt on its veracity. This method often hides a cruel lack of solid arguments. The official
media added that this announcement was part of a witch hunt targeting China. It affirmed,
finally, that this type of statements stemmed from a lack of knowledge on China, a recurrent argument of the CCP.522

V. Politics
A. Political parties
The relationships between parties, or the “Party’s diplomacy,” is an important
front for the CCP, and a significant part of its state diplomacy, as we explained in the section
about the International Liaison Department (ILD), which is in charge of it (→ p. 70).
The Party considers that this diplomatic form presents many advantages: it reinforces the
inter-states relationships, palliate the weaknesses of official diplomacy, offers a vehicle to
broadcast a good image of the Party abroad, and strengthens the Party’s power.523 Although
its activities resemble public diplomacy, they more often than not consist in infiltrating
target societies in order to influence the development of public policies.
These direct relationships between political parties can be used to circumvent official
diplomacy, and allow the CCP to infiltrate the local political life, something that the PRC,
if it were to be a target, would likely qualify as interference. These links can be exploited
in different ways: on the one hand, the relationships with a governing party can, in some
countries, serve as a channel of influence to the government; on the other, the relationships
with one or several opposition parties can be instrumentalized to pressure the government.
Essentially, the relationships between parties enhance the knowledge of the dynamics that characterize the local political life, to identify the potentially exploitable
tensions and weaknesses, but also to broadcast the Party’s propaganda and its narratives,
to defend the Chinese agenda and a positive image of the country, and to participate in
targeting potential sources and “useful idiots.”
Since Xi Jinping came to power, the ILD has multiplied the “presentation sessions” (
宣介会) organized for foreign political personalities,524 officially to respond to a “global
demand.” According to that idea, countries apparently want to know China and the CCP
better, and to understand why they “succeed.” It is apparently the “new question everyone
asks.”525 These presentation sessions are an opportunity to expose the policies led by China,
their successes, to explain the “spirit” (精神) of the Party’s congresses, to demonstrate the
“unique advantage” (独特优势) of the Chinese governing system and of Chinese socialism, and to build a common language.526 The latter is articulated around the rhetoric of
“community of common destiny,” guided by the “Chinese dream,” playing the role of a
“bridge.” It is materialized in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) (→ p. 150).
Besides, rather than mere “presentation” sessions, as the name suggests, they are really
a “recruiting” and building program to rally foreign political parties to the Chinese
agenda. These “presentation sessions” are organized by the ILD, either in China – inviting
foreign political dignitaries -or abroad, sending delegations of the Party to visit targeted
parties directly.

1. A strategy initially oriented toward China’s allies, in a process of
diversification
The target countries are, first and foremost, those in the immediate vicinity of
Beijing, and those who, historically, are part of the “Third World” and share the legacy of Bandung, in Africa, in the Middle East and in Latin America.527 At the “presentation
session” organized in Nanchang, Jiangxi, in November 2019, the ILD gathered some
200 political personalities from about fifty countries to explain the “spirit” (精神) of
the 4th plenum of the 19th Party Congress. To salute the Chinese “achievements,” several
guests took the floor: delegates from the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party, the Democratic
Party of Mongolia, the Baas Party in Syria, Cyprus’ Democratic Rally and the Cambodian
People’s Party.528 Several events of this type were organized at the provincial level to present the Chinese “achievements” on specific themes: the ethnic policy and promotion of
interethnic unity and solidarity in Xinjiang in 2019; the rural revitalization policy in Henan
in 2019; the determining role of the policy of reforms and opening in China’s destiny in
Guangdong in 2018; or even, the promotion of “high quality” development in Zhejiang in
2018.529
Attending these “presentation sessions” were delegates of the Keadilan Party of Malaysia
(in the ruling coalition), Indonesia’s National Mandate Party (minority), the Pakistan
Tehreek-e-Insaf Party (ruling party), the United Hearts Movement of Central African
Republic (presidential majority), Botswana’s Democratic Party (ruling party), Communist
Party of Vietnam (ruling party), United Russia (ruling party), and of the Nationalist Party
of Malta (opposition).530
As for the delegations sent abroad, their number has significantly grown since
2013. According to the data collected by Macro Polo, although only six, then ten countries
received delegations from the ILD in 2013 and 2014, about forty countries were visited
between November 2015 and March 2016, after the 5th plenum of the 18th Congress, about
thirty after the 6th plenum and about sixty after the 19th Congress. This increase reveals the
Party’s growing interest in that vector of influence. The visits were conducted by executives
of the ILD and other structures of the Party-State such as the State Council, the National
People’s Congress, the Central Party School of the CCP, the Propaganda Department, or
the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.531
The highlight of this “Party diplomacy” was the “High-Level Summit: The CCP

会).532 Organized in Beijing from November 30 to December 3, 2017 by the ILD, it gathered a total of 600 executives of about 300 political parties and groups from 120
countries. It was the first summit of this type since the creation of the CCP where, in the
words of the ILD director Song Tao (宋涛), political leaders from all over the world were
brought together around the idea of the creation of a “community of common destiny,”
one of the leitmotiv of the Chinese propaganda we mentioned previously (→ p. 149).533
The subheading of the event was: “Build a community of common destiny and a beautiful world: the responsibility of political parties.” And the summit was structured around
two plenary sessions and one seminar, in the spirit of the 19th Congress, followed by four
conferences on the challenges and the future of the Party’s consolidation; the Party’s experience in the building of a “beautiful” country; the Party’s contributions in the construction
of the Belt and Road Initiative; the responsibility and the role of the leader of the Party in
the construction of a community of common destiny.534 In his opening speech, Xi Jinping
announced that the CCP hoped to institutionalize this summit to make it a high level political dialogue platform with a large representation and influence at the international level,
and that a total of 15,000 political personalities of the entire world would be invited
to China by the CCP over the next five years.535
The complete list of foreign delegates at the Summit was apparently not published and
only the names of those who took the floor during the event are known, although we do
not have access to the content of their speeches. The presence and intervention of Tony
Parker, treasurer of the Republican National Committee (RNC) was noticed and condemned by the RNC chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, who had allegedly not been
informed of his participation, although Parker affirmed had had let her know prior to the
event.536 Invited and sponsored by the EastWest Institute (EWI), Tony Parker previously
took part to other events organized by this think tank, which is closely tied to China.537
In 2016, for instance, he was part of the American delegation to the 9th edition of the
US-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue.538 Other representatives of political
parties already known for their proximity with the CCP also took the floor, such as Serguei
Jelezniak, then vice secretary of the executive board of United Russia (the ruling party);
Aung San Suu Kyi, president of the National League for Democracy (in power at that time)
of Myanmar; Hun Sen, prime minister and president of the Cambodian People Party (ruling party); or Demeke Mekonnen, vice-president of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary
Democratic Front (coalition in power).539 In addition, there were representatives of the
Congolese Party of Labor (ruling majority), Fiji First (ruling party), Sudan’s National

Congress Party (dissolved in 2019), and of the Italian Democratic Party.540 The former
French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin also attended.541
Before this world-scale summit, the ILD organized more targeted, regional forums,
such as those between China and the United States (中美政党对话), China and Africa (中
非政党理论研讨会), China and Asia (中亚政党论坛), and China and Europe (中欧政
党高层论坛).542 In 2017, the China-Africa and China-Asia dialogues held their 3rd and 2nd
editions respectively. The other two, on the other hand, were launched in 2010. The former
Democratic Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the then-director for Chinese Affairs
at the State Department, Richard Llewellyn Williams attended the first edition. Additionally,
the Chinese-American dialogue hosts a bipartisan American delegation approximatively
once a year.543 On December 4, 2017, this dialogue was held around the theme “China
and the United-States: a New Beginning, New Opportunities, New Cooperation” and the
American delegates were able to meet Yang Jiechi.544 An 11th edition was held in November
2019 around the theme “The Chinese and American Political Parties and the China-US
Relations” with the participation of Gary Locke, the Democratic former Secretary of
Commerce in the Obama administration, and first American of Chinese descent appointed
ambassador to China; but with Alphonso Jackson also, a Republican former Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development, already present at the 10th edition.545 These dialogues,
always organized by the ILD, and mostly held in Beijing, gather about fifty participants each
time, mostly representatives of political parties but also from think tanks and the business
world.546
As for the High-Level Forum of Political Parties between China and Europe, at least five
editions have been held since 2010. Also organized by the ILD, this forum was held in various cities of China, including Beijing, Tianjin and Suzhou, but also in Brussels. In 2016, the
5th edition took place in two phases with a first forum in Beijing, followed by an economic
and commercial dialogue centered around the BRI at Zhengzhou, to which 40 political delegates from 20 European countries participated.547 Two Bulgarian delegates, Yanaki Stoilov
and Sergei Stanishev, respectively former vice-president at the National Assembly and for540. Mentions of the parties from Congo: https://archive.vn/nQCYC; from Fiji: https://archive.vn/oThZj; from

mer prime minister of Bulgaria, expressed their support for the BRI during the proceedings
and commended the opportunities it brings to different countries.548
The objective of these events is to reach the largest spectrum of political parties. That is
why several delegates from the same country, but of different political parties, can be targeted. The ILD has, for instance, invited Francis Wurtz, former president of the European
United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) and member of the French Communist
Party but also Thierry Mariani, former vice-president of the French Union for a Popular
Movement (UMP).549 In the case of Germany, the ILD invited Lothar Bisky, former
co-president of the German left-wing party, Die Linke, and president of the GUE/NGL,
along with Reinhard Bütikofer, a member of the German ecologist party Alliance 90/The
Greens and former vice-president of the European Green Party, or Elmar Brock, a member of the European People’s Party and president of the Committee on Foreign Affairs
of the European Parliament.550 Similarly, Charles Michel, president of the Reformist
Movement, later Prime Minister of Belgium, Philippe Lamberts, member of the Belgian
Ecolo Party and then co-president of the European Green Party, along with Véronique
de Keyser, member of the Belgium Socialist Party and former vice-president of the
Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats of the European Parliament also participated in this forum.551 We can note some participants from Spain, Emilio Menéndez del
Valle, a member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats; from Sweden,
Kent Härstedt, member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and president of the
Friendship Association for China of the Swedish Parliament; from Great-Britain, Graham
Watson, president of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party group (ELDR),
from Montenegro, Srđan Milić, president of the Socialist People’s Party of Montenegro,
and even from Ireland, Dick Roche, former member of the Republic Party Fianna Fáil,
Irish minister for European Affairs and vice-president of the ELDR.552

2. Converting influence into political resources
The network weaved by the ILD enables it to identify and retain politicians willing to defend China’s image by intervening in local media or acting behind the scenes in
the CCP’s interest. Lothar Bisky for instance, said he was impressed by the CCP’s determination to improve the living condition of the Chinese population,553 and he criticized the
coverage of China in Western media, which he did not consider to be objective.554 Philippe
Lamberts was impressed by China’s commitment to build social harmony and environmental awareness, qualifying the PRC as a “natural partner of the EU” and affirming that “the
destinies of all countries are tied.”555 Thierry Mariani commended the Chinese initiative

– i.e. the forum – in promoting a mutual understanding and he called for a deeper cooperation between China and France.556
As for Irish former minister Dick Roche, who had already commended “China’s spectacular results” and called to increase the cooperation with China,557 he became a consultant
with European institutions, and his main client, Huawei, presumably paid him between
€100,000 and €200,000 between 2018 and 2019, according to the EU’s transparency register,558 which led some media outlets to call him a “Huawei lobbyist.” He was joined by the
former European diplomat Serge Abou, also on the payroll of the Chinese company.559 They
are not the only Europeans who have offered their services – and opened their contact
books – to Chinese clients. In its attempt to win the Estonian market for the construction of the 5G network, Huawei turned to the PR consultant company Powerhouse, which
employed three former Estonian ministers: the company’s co-founder Janek Mäggi, a
former public administration minister, Marko Pomerants and Andres Anvelts, who both
occupied several ministerial positions, including at the ministry of the interior.560 According
to Re: Baltica, Pomerants and Mäggi sought to open the doors of the Estonian government
to Huawei by mobilizing their personal network: Pomerants’s party (Isamaa) was in the
ruling power coalition at the time.561 A member of the Estonian Social Democratic Party,
and a former participant to the China-Europe Forum organized by the ILD, Randel Länts
managed the “government relations” pole in the consulting company Miltton, which supposedly offered PR services to the Chinese Embassy in Tallinn.562 In fact, Central and
Eastern European countries are specifically targeted by the ILD, who has organized
two types of forums for this region (→ p. 310): the Dialogue Between Political Parties of
China and Central and Eastern Europe (中国- 中东欧政党对话会), in Budapest in 2016
and Bucharest in 2017, but also the Forum of Young Political Leaders of China and Central
and Eastern Europe (中国与中东欧青年政治家论坛), in Beijing in 2015, which invited
Mailis Reps, an Estonian Centre Party minister of education and research, among others.563
Maintaining direct relations with influential politicians in any country opens the
doors to infiltrating its societies, collecting official and unofficial support, and to
bypassing potential blockages inside the structures of power using opposition or
“retired” politicians. The Party already prides itself that China’s position on the South
China Sea is supported by “over 120 states, 240 political groups and parties, and 280 think
tanks and NGOs” across the world, the result of an effective “party diplomacy.”564 Others
have expressed support for the Chinese policy in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, or praised the
BRI. Such support often comes from political parties with ideals close to the CCP’s, such as
Cyprus’ Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL), a “communist ally” and one of the

most important parties in the country. Its secretary general, Andros Kyprianou, has often
taken a stand in favor of China, its governance model, the BRI, or denounced the “violence” in Hong Kong.565 This party was also targeted by visits from the ILD and “presentation sessions.”566 More recently, a dozen political leaders supposedly sent congratulation
messages to the ILD to praise the Chinese management of the Covid-19 crisis.567 Besides,
the ILD organized a video-conference in June 2020, as part of the “CCP in Dialogue”
Summit, with communist parties from Latin America countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chili,
Cuba, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela) on “the Strengths of Popular Philosophy of the CCP
and its Response to Covid-19” – which sets the tone of the discussion.568
Furthermore, this party diplomacy improves the Chinese’s understanding of
national events. In 2014, exchanges between the ILD and a delegation from the Estonian
Parliament, presided by Marko Mihkelson, focused, among other things, on the situation
in Ukraine. It enabled the Chinese to better understand how the United States and its allies
reacted to the Russian aggression, and, as such, helped them think about their own actions
in Hong Kong, in the South China Sea, and vis-à-vis Taiwan.569
Another objective of this “Party diplomacy” is to reinforce China’s discursive power
at the international level.570 When China calls for the development of a new “common
language” across the world, it evidently does not refer to any common language, but its
own, of which the key words are “community of common destiny,” “win-win cooperation,”
“new international order,” “international peace,” “world development,” and so on.571 The
more political leaders and other influential personalities adopt this vocabulary, even if they
do not endorse what it really means for the Chinese, the more China’s discursive power, its
capacity to impose its narratives on China and the world is strengthened. By imposing its
elements of speech, the Party shapes the debate, builds filters and interpretation
schemes that favor it.572 The Party also seeks to impose a “good” image of China and to
tell the “right” stories regarding China. Several pages of the ILD’s website titled “Stories
of the CCP” (中国共产党的故事), explain, for instance, China’s various “achievements”
in different domains.573 The Chinese make sure to use a discourse that can be echoed at the
international level, and that foreign audience can easily accept.574

Beyond the advantages stemming from tightening relations with foreign political parties,
this kind of events also enables the CCP to restore its image and to reinforce its legitimacy
and credibility. Holding the 2017 “CCP in Dialogue” Summit was, according to ILD director Song Tao, “largely applauded by the international community,” it “showed the great
political inclusiveness and moral attractiveness of the Party,” and “represented a major contribution to further the world political civilization.”575 To quote the words used by China,
this kind of event is, indeed, an occasion to put forward CCP’s “political advantage” (政治
优势), and to show its “worldwide influence capacity” (世界影响力),576 without necessarily trying to export the Chines model.577

3. Priority to investments in the regions
The Canadian case (→ p. 539) illustrates the fact that Chinese efforts towards foreign
political circles are often directed primarily towards the local and regional levels, which
are more accessible and discreet targets, and make it possible to cover the territory
and be as close as possible to the population.
In France, as elsewhere, the Chinese Embassy lobbies MPs and senators intensively,
and organizes regional events with local political authorities, who are often in demand.
This is notably the case of the Hauts-de-France region, which has notably developed its
relations with China. Every year since 2017, it has invited the Chinese ambassador to celebrate the Chinese New Year in a large ceremony in Lille.578 On January 13, 2020, the event
was co-organized with the Confucius Institute of the University of Artois.579 For the same
reasons that favor decentralization in its influence efforts, Beijing is particularly seeking to
locate its Confucius institutes and classes in medium-sized universities (→ p. 300).
The Hauts-de-France region has also entered into an agreement with China’s Zhejiang
province (September 2019) as well as between the ports of Dunkirk and Ningbo (April
2019).

Influencing federated and decentralized actors: the German example
In Germany, Berlin is not the best environment to observe and analyze China’s interferences.
The federal organization of Germany de facto renders it far more vulnerable to interference at the Länder level (Bavaria and Bada-Wurtemberg where companies are particularly
exposed to the Chinese market, as well as North-Rhine-Westphalia with Duisburg, a Chinesestyle smart city).
No study at the local level has been conducted, in North-Rhine-Westphalia for instance, to
establish a precise map of the numerous Chinese initiatives, apparently under the cover of
business development, and the economic-financial interdependencies stemming from it (business trips, economic partnerships, R&D, university programs). Duisburg (a project of digital
city, or smart city580) and Gelsenkirchen are often pointed out as vulnerable due to their financial situations (in the Ruhr region) and partnerships with Chinese companies such as Huawei
(Duisburg)
The difficulty comes from the decentralized political power and its federal character, which limit any attempt at centralizing information, and hence any coordinated federal policy response.
For foreign actors, Germany’s decentralization is a “windfall for influence actions.”581
In addition, parts of the partnerships (such as the Thousand Talents program (→ p. 292), support to study programs, etc.) are not covered by the 2018 German law on foreign investment,
because they are not participations in a company’s capital or joint-ventures.582
The different political cultures in Germany, between the East and the West, even thirty years
after the fall of the Berlin Wall, favor the permeability to CCP narratives. The foothold of the
AfD and Die Linke parties, both vectors of greater acceptance of authoritarian discourses
than in the West, is doubled with a tendency to use a narrative of victimization in a part of the
electorate (Ossis, victims of the West). This is, in fine, a more permissive and vulnerable
environment for the actions of Chinese actors and their relays – highlighting the discriminations supposedly faced by China and its companies.

B. People
“What other country, besides China, coopts as many former leaders from all over the
planet?”583 Le Canard enchaîné asked after listing two former French Prime Minister (JeanPierre Raffarin et Dominique de Villepin), one former British Prime Minister (David
Cameron), a former German vice-Chancellor (Philippe Rösler) and one former Australian
Prime Minister (Paul Keating) – a list far from exhaustive that encompasses practically
every country. As was previously mentioned, in Estonia for instance, “the Powerhouse
company, which was lobbying in the name of the Chinese company Huawei, employs three
former Estonian ministers”584 (→ p. 259).
The Chinese Communist Party has always forged links with politicians from
countries whose positions, or at least, whose representations of China, they wished to
influence. These practices were also part of the Soviet repertoire of active measures and
are among United Front activities. In the Chinese case, the ILD plays an important role in
this type of operations as it is responsible for maintaining most of the bilateral relations
with political parties.

Synopsis (25 Sept. 2020).

It can be noted, however, that the CCP has made increasingly important efforts regarding targets that could be particularly useful. One method seen in Australia,585 but also in
European institutions, consists in appointing advisors close to Western politicians.
Charles Parton thus reported that, during the visit of European MEPs in Beijing, a “British
deputy had brought his advisor, a former Chinese professor, to an internal meeting, and
had defended positions that differed little, or not at all, from the Propaganda department’s
documents. Said advisor is well known in Brussels for organizing pro-China events.”586
The ties can be varied: some politicians are only contacts to Chinese agents using them
to transmit messages or influence opinions; another circle is composed of politicians who
can be manipulated, based on their ideology or sheer interest: they are “useful idiots”; a
third group is composed of individuals fully aware of working for Chinese interests and
who accept it, whatever the reason may be. They are actual influence agents that Beijing
can trust with more specific directives; finally, the last circle, closest to the Party, is composed of those formally recruited by Chinese intelligence services. When politicians
stay out of reach from Beijing’s efforts, the Party can use intimidation or punitive actions
(one of its most common weapons being visa denial, used against researchers [→ p. 285]
but also against recalcitrant politicians). The level of penetration and the number of politicians under influence greatly vary from country to country. Many cases are known in
Australia and New Zealand, but the phenomenon touches everyone, everywhere.
In Germany for instance, Bundestag politicians, MPs and ex-MPs from all parties,
are courted by companies or the embassy: from the CDU-CSU (Hans-Peter Friedrich
(CDU), vice-president of Bundestag is seen as pro-China) through exchange programs dedicated to young talents, to the FDP, SPD, or the AfD. The B’90-Grünen is the only group
that seems to stay impermeable to these actions of influence (except for Jürgen Trittin), due
to the prominence of human rights issues and to its core environmentalist ideology. The
case of SPD deputies of the Bundestag Commission for Human Right, prohibited from
entering the territory and denied entry visas in 2018, is often mentioned as an example
of a visible, voluntary action. This initiative falls within a networking-lobbying approach
brought about by several lead executives of German companies (Siemens, VW, etc.), all part
of the DAX of the China-Brücke, and based on the model of the Transatlantik-Brücke; it
shows that those who are pro-China still favor dialogue and see Beijing as an unavoidable
trade partner (→ p. 252).587

When a German MP hijacks a Chinese communication operation with some irony
In 2018, more than 100 Bundestag MPs received copies of the English edition of Xi Jinping’s
recently-published China’s Governance II. The shipment was decided by a German marketing
agency (Beijing makes extensive use of local communication and marketing agencies and lobbyists to try to improve its image). The letter accompanying the book informed the MPs that
it was free of charge but asked them in return to “display the books in their constituencies
and send a photo to an e-mail address of the agency.”588 CDU MP Michael Brand, who is no
stranger to Beijing, had an idea. He has specialized in the protection of religious minorities
and has been known for his outspokenness toward the CCP, which made him persona non grata
in China after he refused to answer the Chinese ambassador to Germany’s demand to censor
his own website two years earlier (the ambassador asked him to remove photos and texts about
the persecution of religious minorities). When he received Xi Jinping’s book and the request
to display and photograph it, Brand did so: he displayed the books on a shelf, alongside books
dedicated to crimes committed by the CCP or to resistant figures, such as the Dalai Lama and
the artist Ai Weiwei. He took a photo (below) and sent it back to the sender.

In the Czech Republic, another interesting European example, Chinese influence on
politicians has reached new heights. MapInfluenCE described a massive penetration of
Czech political networks,589 the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) most specifically. The links between this party and the CCP pre-date the election of President Miloš
Zeman, and rest on a few key individuals such as Jan Hamáček, who leads the party,
or Jan Kohout, a presidential advisor who was appointed head of the New Silk Road
Institute Prague in 2015. According to MapInfluenCE, the social-democrats also harbor
politically-involved entrepreneurs who use this platform to develop ties with the CCP
or structures related to it. This influence can be illustrated by Jaroslav Tvrdík, a ČSSD
former MP and defense minister in the governments of Miloš Zeman and Vladimír
Špidla. He was vice-president of the board of directors of the Chinese company CEFC
in Europe between 2015 and 2020.
588. Brause et al., “Chinas heimliche Propagandisten.”
589. Their work is available via this link: https://www.chinfluence.eu/.

264

The close links between Tvrdík and China date back to at least 2012, when he became
president of the supervisory board of the Czech-China Chamber of Mutual Cooperation,
and then chairman of its board of directors two years later.590 Tvrdík subsequently became
an advisor for Jiří Rusnok and Bohuslav Sobotka, prime ministers from 2013 to 2014 and
from 2014 to 2017 respectively, on issues regarding China.591 In 2015, the Chinese conglomerate CEFC Group Europe set up its European headquarters in Prague, and launched an
aggressive acquisition drive that targeted numerous Czech companies: J&T Finance Group,
the airline Travel Group, the multimedia group Empresa Media, and even the football club
SK Slavia Prague. Jaroslav Tvrdík, who was appointed vice-president of CEFC Europe,
played a key role in the majority of these acquisitions. He also became chairman of the
supervisory board of SK Slavia Prague in 2015, and then chairman of its board of directors
in 2016. The president and founder of CEFC, Ye Jianming was, on his part, appointed
political and economic advisor to the Czech president Milos Zeman.592 In 2017, this
progression was hit by a scandal when CEFC was accused by the U.S. Justice Department
of having bribed the Chadian president with €2 million in exchange for oil exploitation
rights. Furthermore, CEFC China Energy was not able to pay its debt obligations, estimated at €475 million, to J&T Private Investments on time. Hence, J&T obtained the
shareholder rights and appointed a new president.593 Ye Jianming was eventually arrested in
China in late 2018 on charges of corruption and economic crimes.594
The CITIC company, controlled by the Chinese government and, “for several specialists,
an extraordinary den of intelligence officers,”595 took control of CEFC and managed to
recover the group’s presidency by settling parts of its debt.596 Tvrdík was again appointed
vice-chairman of CEFC Europe.597 Tvrdík is also seemingly tied to the supervisory board
of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Foundation (TMC) which, as we saw, is one of Beijing’s
influence tools (→ p. 152). Finally, he owns shares (25%) in the firm Little Mole Cartoon
which, in 2016, coproduced with CCTV a 52-episode TV show depicting the little Czech
mole and the Giant Chinese panda preparing the visit of Xi Jinping in Prague.598 That sole
example shows how the CCP manages to turn local politicians in true agents, capable
of infiltrating the political society of a nation.

The resistance of Prague’s mayor
Zdeněk Hřib, mayor of Prague since 2018, did not fold under Chinese pressure when the
Chinese ambassador asked him to exclude the Taiwan representative from a meeting with
foreign diplomats. As the Ambassador invoked a clause from the 2016 agreement stipulating
that Prague and Beijing are twin cities, and by which Prague committed its support to the One
China policy, Hřib asked to drop the clause insofar as it regarded a foreign policy matter, in
which an agreement between two cities had no weight. He additionally stood out by raising
the Tibetan flag on the façade of the town hall in March 2019, to commemorate the 60th
Anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising (a tradition in Prague first set by Vaclav Havel that
had been abandoned in 2014), by welcoming the exiled Tibetan government leader Lobsang
Sangay for a visit, and by going to Taipei for an official visit of his own. In addition, he has
regularly denounced the Human Rights violations committed by China.

The visit of the president of Czech Parliament in Taiwan
On January 10, 2020, the Chinese Ambassador in Prague sent a threatening letter to the
then-president of the parliament, Jaroslav Kubera, second most important political figure in
the country, to dissuade him from going on his planned visit to Taiwan. The letter stated that,
if need be, retaliatory measures would be taken against Czech companies in China, such as
Skoda Auto and Home Credit Group. In the end, Kubera could not see his project through –
he died from a cardiac arrest ten days later, on January 20. His successor, Miloš Vystrčil, was
subjected to equal pressure but he did not fold: he partook in a particularly mediatized official
visit in Taiwan, at the head of a delegation of 90 people, from August 30 to September 4, 2020.
The Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi immediately reacted to Prague crossing a
“red line”; he hence announced that the country would pay a “heavy price” for this insult.599
Several days later, Song Tao (宋涛), the head of the ILD (→ p. 70), asked the president of the
central committee of the Czech Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSČM), Vojtěch
Filip, to distance himself from Vystrčil.600 The country’s president Zeman subsequently announced that he would do the same.601
The president of the parliament was also targeted by a defamation campaign, with misinformation stating that he had been paid $4 million by Taiwan for the visit, a sum supposedly
meant to finance a future presidential campaign. The media Aktuálně.cz received messages
from Michael Winkler and Robert J. Mojzes, representing the Swiss consulting firm RefinSol
Advisory Services, inviting them to publish this (fake) news. Aktuálně.cz inquired about the
informants and established that they were also behind eurasiainfo.ch, which seemingly relays
information from the Chinese Embassy in Switzerland.602 Winkler also wrote pro-Beijing articles (one was titled “Xi Jinping: a Responsible Leader in Switzerland,” in which he praised
the Chinese president for the “depth of his knowledge on the historical ties” between the
two countries and “the clarity and fairness of his objectives” during his visit).603 According to
University of Basel Professor Ralph Weber, the RefinSol Advisory Services and eurasiainfo.ch
offices are both located next to an association for overseas Chinese from the Jiangxi province
headed by Zhu Ailian (朱爱莲), who runs eurasiainfo.ch with Winkler and Moizes. They seem
close to the CCP: on a picture on the European Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce website, that
she also runs, she poses with the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan.604

The CCP also seems very active within the Italian political class, targeting the M5S
in particular.605 The situation is judged even more worrying since the Italian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs has little resources on China. In addition, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Luigi Di Maio, is perceived to be fully aligned with the CCP’s cause, defending its interests
in Italy – although his positions seem to have evolved recently.606 He was notably criticized
for signing a Belt and Roads Initiative agreement in March 2019, when he was minister of
the Economic Development, which has increased the Italian trade imbalance and eased the
Chinese penetration in Italy since.
In France, as much as anywhere else, the Party has forged strong relationships
with individuals enabling China to infiltrate the political sphere, defend its interest
and silence critical voices. Beyond individuals punctually and diversely recruited by the

Party, the construction of a Chinese network within the French elite runs through the
France-China Foundation since 2013. According to its staff, the foundation’s “Young
Leaders” program aims to “promote the meeting of high potential individuals from China
and France from diverse background (economic, political, cultural, media), who will play
an important role in their home country or in the context of China-France relations.” The
foundation was created by Emmanuel Lenain, Arnaud Ventura, Nicolas Macquin and Shan
Sa on the French side.607 “‘The profiles are screened,’ recognized Nicolas Macquin. ‘There is
a division within the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs – the Institute of Foreign Affairs
of the Chinese people – that controls all these exchange and cooperation programs.’ The
ministry itself lists the participants. Sponsoring the program, it ensures that one of its
representatives is included in each of the sessions. They are Beijing’s eye, in some ways.”608
If the list of the sessions reveals judicious choices among the French elite, the same cannot be said about the Chinese elite. In fact, this type of structure serves, first and foremost,
China’s interest by favoring the emergence of positive perceptions of China among the
recipients and the creation of a reserve army from which the Party can draw to lead
its influence operations. In China, the foundation is tied to the Chinese People’s Institute
of Foreign Affairs (中国人民外交学会), which was created by Zhou Enlai (周恩来) in
1949 to put in place a people-to-people diplomacy – in other words, to open more channels
toward foreign elites. Today, the institute works within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
ensures the ideological compatibility of selected French individuals. The Chinese system
is not very different from how the Soviets used to send delegations abroad to provide the KGB with avenues of penetration in targeted societies and to facilitate the
selection of potential “useful idiots.”
This strategy of recruiting current or retired foreign politicians is led simultaneously to
the ILD’s activities specifically targeting political parties.

C. The elections
Chinese electoral interferences have long existed (there were allegations of illegal Chinese
donations during the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign),609 but the evident Chinese disinhibition in that regard is more recent. According to an ASPI report, China interfered in 10
elections in 7 countries over the past decade, an majority of which took place in the
Indo-Pacific region (Australia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan),610
the only other country being the United States. To this list a few local elections in Canada
can be added, as voters were encouraged, via WeChat, to vote for certain candidates of
Chinese descent in exchange for money (→ p. 562).
The Canadian and Australian cases are, as usual, fairly similar, with the most obvious
interferences conducted in the most “Sinicized” districts of the country, Richmond
in British Colombia for Canada (54% of residents are of Chinese descent) and Bennelong
(New South Wales) in Australia (21%).611 The American case is interesting insofar as it

involved a cyberattack targeting Biden’s team, which could be an attempt to copy what the
Russians did in 2016 with the DNC Leaks (→ p. 625).
However, the Taiwanese case remains the best documented (→ p. 458), in particular
the 2018 elections that marked the “first claim of a direct PLA involvement in disinformation on social media for election interference.”612

On WeChat, a letter instructing votes in Australia
In December 2017, in the context of a local election in the Bennelong district, in New South
Wales, which is the district with the highest proportion of residents of Chinese descent (21%),
a letter calling to vote for the Labor candidate and to defeat the Liberal Party (described as “anti-Chinese”) was circulated along with a call to “overthrow” the Turnbull government. This letter, which was not signed, was nonetheless widely shared on WeChat by Yan Zehua, Australian
citizen of Chinese descent and vice-president of the Australian branch of the Council for the
Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China, an organization of the United Front.613

VI. Education
The economic dependence vis-à-vis China, the freedom of expression on campuses and
the role of Confucius Institutes, are topics that have increasingly worried universities across
the world and that, in some countries like Australia, have been debated beyond academic
circles. They have been deemed matters of national interests.

A. Universities
It is fairly easy to understand why foreign universities are one of the main targets of
Chinese influence operations: “the CCP has a deep understanding of the importance
of ideas and ideological struggle in the contest for political power, so ideas and
those who generate them are a central target of the CCP’s influence work.”614

Third preferred destination in the world for international students, after the United
States and the United Kingdom, Australia is, by far, the country that welcomes the most
students as a proportion of its population (1,559 for 100,000 inhabitants, compared to 653
for the United Kingdom, 517 for Canada, 379 for France and 304 for the United States).615
International students are very important for Australia, as the revenues they bring (tuition
fees, contributions to the economy), tens of billions of Australian dollars, represent the
third source of revenues for the country in the export market, after minerals.
And Chinese students represent, by far, the first contingent (60% on average for
the eight most prestigious Australian universities, even 69% for the University of Sydney,
66% at the University of New South Wales, and 56% at the University of Melbourne).616
In some programs and classes, they even represent a strong majority of students, with possible adverse effects: when 80% of the students are Chinese, as is the case in some MBAs,
other students are dissuaded from attending (young Australians choose North America or
Europe instead), insofar as everyone speaks Chinese in class and it is of lesser interest in
terms of networking, which is one of the main motivations for this kind of program.
In any case Chinese students generated AUS$534 million (€340 million) at the University
of Sydney (23% of its total revenue) in 2017, 446 million (€285 million) at the University
of New South Wales (22 %) and 410 million (€262 million) at the University of Melbourne
(16 %).617 In other words, in some cases, close to a quarter of their revenues comes from
Chinese students, without counting funding from Chinese companies. These proportions
have made universities – some more than others – dependent on Chinese students. It is
even more salient with the decreasing public subsidies from the government.
However, after an uninterrupted growth since 2010 (about +10% per year on average),
the number of study permits delivered to Chinese has stagnated between 2017 and 2018,
before decreasing between 2018 and 2019 (-3.3%). This tendency stems from various fac614. Hamilton, “Chinese Communist Party Influence in Australian Universities.”

tors, including the development, and thus increased attractiveness, of Chinese universities,
but also the bilateral tensions since 2017-2018 – approximately when Australia became
more cognizant to the “existential” threat that China’s influence represents (→ p. 544).
This dependence on Chinese students in Australian universities is, in fact, representative
of Australia’s overall dependence to China. It is similar to how Beijing weaponizes the number of tourists in some areas (→ p. 405); it uses students to pressure Australia. In June
2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a warning advising Chinese students
not to go to Australia due to Covid-19-related risks, but also to the “racial discrimination”
they presumably face in the country.618 The economic consequences of a drastic fall in the
number of Chinese students in Australia have created pressing concerns in the country, for
which the only solution is to break the dependency – in other words, to diversify (→ p. 273).
The Australian case is the most spectacular, but is far from being the only one. Other
countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, are facing the same problem. The United Kingdom does not have such a big Chinese diaspora
(0.7% of the population),619 but its main vulnerability regarding influence resides precisely
in the fact that its universities welcome “more Chinese students than the rest of Europe
combined.”620 The financial dependence toward Chinese students increased throughout the
last decade. Since 2014-15, their number went from 89,540 to 120,385, a 34% increase in
five years.621 It is, by far, the largest non-European student group (three times more than
Indians). About fifteen universities earn over a fifth of their income from them. According
to the Global Times, the United Kingdom has become a more popular destination than the
United States for Chinese students.622 Just like everywhere else, the richest schools, such
as Oxford or Cambridge, have the resources to resist and Beijing has more leverage on
universities where Chinese students are the most numerous, Nottingham and the LSE for
instance. The situation is similar in the United States (329,000 Chinese students in 2017,
over five times more than ten years ago)623 and in Canada (→ p. 567).
Essentially, this financial dependence, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a
Confucius Institute (→ p. 299), renders these universities less susceptible to resist
Chinese influence operations. On the contrary, it pushes them to actively participate in self-censorship, to avoid saying or doing things that displease Beijing. “We don’t
bite the hand that feeds us,” replied the hierarchy of a professor at an Australian university when he expressed his concerns about the safety of Hong Kong students.624 All
the more so since, within its dissuasion arsenal, Beijing has other ways to pressure them,
including cyberattacks. The attack that targeted the Australian National University (ANU)
in Canberra at the end of 2018, revealed in June 2019, and that allowed the responsible
parties to steal the personal information of thousands of students and staff members, was
not officially attributed, but its target and degree of sophistication presupposed a level of
skills that only a few states had.

Two cases at Charles University, the oldest University in Central Europe
The prestigious Charles University in Czech Republic, the oldest in Central Europe, was the
target of at least two Chinese influence operations.
– The Balabán case. In 2015, a Chinese-Czech center was created at Charles University, in
Prague, with Miloš Balabán as secretary general. He was not entirely unknown to the Czech
security and intelligence service (BIS), which, in their 2013 annual report, noted that the 9th
Prague Security conference, organized by Balabán, showcased a certain leniency regarding
the activities of Russian and Chinese intelligence services but an eagerness to denounce the
activities of the Czechs’ American ally.625 In 2015, Balabán, who was cumulating his new position at the China-Czech center with that of director of another of the university’s research
center, the Center for Security Policy, created a private namesake company (Center for Security
Policy). Through this private company, China financed the annual conferences of the ChinaCzech center in 2018 and 2019, for approximately €47,000. The objective of the financial arrangement was apparently caution, enabling Balabán to not mention the Chinese money when
questioned on how the 2019 conference was funded: it was paid by the China-Czech center
(€20,000) and other participants (€2,300), he replied, omitting to highlight that China was its
main contributor (€23,500).626 When it was revealed, Balabán resigned from both centers at the
university. It was later uncovered that in 2018, Balabán had volunteered a university course on
the BRI, which he co-taught, and at the end of which the eight best students were offered a
free trip to China through the Bridge for the Future program. The class was allegedly invoiced
not to the university but, through his private company, to the Embassy of China, who paid
him €2,700.627
– The PPF case. PPF (První Privatizační Fond) is an important Czech financial group, “the
richest private company in the Czech Republic,”628 which owns Home Credit, a company
that makes most of its profit in China. It seems, however, that Beijing had put a condition
to its access to the Chinese market: an improvement of the relationships between the Czech
Republic and China. For that reason, and to convince Beijing, PPF worked hard to “help flip
the government’s anti-communist foreign policy into a pro-China one.” They notably “arranged a Beijing visit by Czech President Milos Zeman in 2014, even supplying a private jet to
fly him back.”629 The efforts paid off: that same year, Home Credit was granted access to the
Chinese market, with important financial benefits. At the start of October 2019, Home Credit
offered to sponsor Charles University if it signed an agreement to “not hurt PPF’s global
interests,” which essentially “translated that the university would have to stop all criticisms
toward China.” However, “Charles University has many influential critics of China in its staff,
including Martin Hala and his organization Sinopsis, an institution that has examined and exposed the Czech Republic’s questionable dealings with Beijing. Within days of learning about
Home Credit’s sponsorship agreement with Charles University, students, faculty and Czech
media lambasted the university’s leadership, prompting Home Credit to withdraw its offer and
the head of the university to publicly apologize for his role in the matter.”630

Aware of their vulnerabilities, Australian universities and the government are organizing
themselves. In August 2019, they created a University Foreign Interference Taskforce with
government and university representatives. This group published guidelines for Australian
universities in November. To reduce the Chinese influence, they generally encouraged
the diversification of students (such as Indian students, whose enrollment has increased
a lot recently, although it remains far from the volume represented by the Chinese – they
are also less solvent; Australia being on the same segment as the United Kingdom, Brexit
could benefit Australian universities by redirecting a part of the flow of Indian students),
increased subsidies from the government and Australian businesses; and red-lined
strategic topics (AI, quantum computing, engineering – but it generated a debate, insofar
as, due to the Chinese head start there, depriving the country of such collaborations could
be scientifically damaging).
Finally, it should be remembered that the financial pressure – without necessarily going
as far as dependence – is exerted via the income generated not only by the presence
of Chinese students but also by Chinese funding for laboratories, research, events or
teaching programs, especially in Chinese language. In Germany, for example, the Free
University of Berlin signed a contract with Hanban (the Chinese organization that manages
Confucius Institutes → p. 299) granting it nearly €500,000 over five years to train some 20
Chinese language teachers each year. The contract contains clauses allowing Beijing to exert
political pressure on the content of the teaching, notably by offering the Chinese side the
possibility of reducing or suspending its financing if it considers that certain elements of
the program are contrary to Chinese law, or of revoking the contract with more advantageous conditions than if the university does.631 There are many more or less formalized
and binding agreements. In a small country like Slovakia, which is part of a region (the
Visegrád group, and more broadly Central and Eastern Europe) that is strategic for Beijing
(→ p. 310), no less than 113 formal relationships have been identified between Chinese
entities (universities but also other organizations such as the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences or Hanban, and companies such as Huawei and ZTE), and Slovak universities and
research institutes. The peak was reached in 2016-2017, with ten new agreements signed
yearly.632

2. Academic freedom and freedom of expression on campuses
Many of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students on foreign campus are nationalists. In Australia for instance, “the vast majority of them are Chinese government supporters.”633 And some have been particularly zealous and aggressive, if not violent. They
create problems, particularly, but not only, by attempting to restrict academic liberties and
freedom of expression in the university community, starting with that of their Chinese
peers. It is important to emphasize that this latter attitude only concerns a minority of
them – especially since some Chinese students choose these countries precisely because
they want to escape the Chinese regime, at least temporarily, breathe a little, and taste the
freedom offered by democracies. The primary objective of this active minority is to

prevent their peers from accessing these liberties, the democratic values and freedom that could, in the mind of the CCP, corrupt them.

a. Surveillance and intimidation of Chinese students.
Chinese students abroad are one of the priority targets identified by Xi Jinping
at the United Front Work Conference in 2015 (with the New Media, young entrepreneurs
and intellectuals not members of the Party).634 The reason is simple: “the CCP makes
extensive efforts to keep overseas students in line partly because it is anxious that
they may be ‘infected’ by Western ideas.”635 They are, as such, constantly monitored by
others among them. In South Korea where about 40% of foreign students are Chinese,
“there is a saying among the teachers: ‘at least one of your Chinese students is an
informant.’”636 It is likely true. Chinese studying abroad, in the United States, in Australia,
or elsewhere, revealed that their parents in China had been informed and questioned on the
fact that their child had gone to a class in which they had said this or that. The director of
Human Rights Watch for China mentioned the case of a graduated student who spoke of
something in a closed seminar on the campus of an American university, and two days later,
his parents in China received a visit from the Ministry of Public Security “asking why their
kid had brought up these touchy topics that were embarrassing to China in a classroom in
the U.S.”637 This is the proof that informants in class do not only protest to attempt to
influence class materials and campus activities, but in fact partake in a practical and
permanent surveillance, relay these information (who said what, where, and in front of
whom) to the authorities, likely through the consulate or the embassy, who then relay them
to Beijing for potential measures to be taken, in the form of pressure on the parents – the
whole circuit happening in 48 hours, which indicates a rather well-oiled system.
This puts the teachers in an ethical dilemma, explained Kevin Carrico, who teaches
China studies at Monash University in Australia: on the one hand, as a teacher in a free
country, he does not want to make concessions on the content; on the other hand, what he
says in class, or what his students say in class, is surveilled and relayed to Chinese authorities
and the families. How to protect students without compromising on the content?638
Surveillance is also constant outside the classroom, especially during demonstrations. Chinese students, some of whom have chosen Australia to enjoy greater freedom,
are watched as if they were still in China, primarily by some of their peers, but also by
embassy and consulate officials and numerous party-related organizations. Here is a typical
student testimony: “When I came to Australia, I thought I would finally be able to demonstrate freely. During [a] demonstration [in Melbourne, against the treatment of Chinese
doctors and journalists who tried to alert the public about Covid-19], someone took my
picture, which later ended up on WeChat. Then I got a video call from my parents, who
were at the police station. The policeman told me that I had to go back to China and turn
myself in, that what I had done was illegal and anti-Chinese.” The student does not dare to
go back home anymore and she has “also stopped talking to [her] parents to avoid putting
them in danger.”639

Intimidation is even stronger with regard to at least two categories of students.
On the one hand, scholarship recipients (in France, for example, there are 1,400 scholarship recipients out of 30,000 Chinese students640), because they are financially dependent
on Beijing and therefore cannot refuse anything to the embassy or the Party. On the other
hand, minority students (notably Uyghurs and Tibetans) and/or protest movements
(such as the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong). And this is true no matter where
in the world they are. The Party manages to exert pressure on them, most often via their
relatives, their parents, who remain in China. A Uyghur student at a university in western
France explained: “The [Chinese] police ask me what I’m doing [by e-mail and telephone],
whether I’ve participated in activities, whether I see other Uyghurs. I have to keep sending copies of my documents, taking pictures of myself in front of my college. If I don’t
answer, they come to my parents’ house in Xinjiang.”641
On campuses, intimidation frequently goes as far as physical aggression. Over
the summer 2019, the Hong Kong crisis reached Australian and New Zealander universities. Several times, particularly on the campuses of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart
and Auckland, the same scenario repeated itself: pacific demonstrations of pro-Hong Kong
democracy students were interrupted by pro-Beijing students yelling nationalist songs, such
as “China is great,” and ripping signs and posters. It sometimes escalated, particularly on
the campus of the University of Queensland (UQ), in Brisbane, where 300 pro-Beijing
students physically attacked the pro-democracy protestors, dealing hits, before the police
intervened. The Chinese consulate later issued a statement praising the “patriotic
behavior” of the students, which led to a reaction from the minister of Defense, calling
foreign diplomats to not interfere. In fact, UQ has strong ties to the consulate: the consul
himself was appointed guest professor that same month (July 2019).642 Moreover, pro-Beijing actors use WeChat groups to mobilize people before pro-democracy gatherings they
are aware of, to fight “the separatist forces to the end” and “never make a concession.”643
Harassment also takes place online: pro-democracy students are targeted by hate
campaigns and frequently threatened. Drew Pavlou, a 20-year-old UQ student, and one of
the main organizers of pro-democracy protests in favor of Hong Kong, received dozens
of death threats. In a message, a user told him he would hire an assassin in the Deep Web
to kill his family (picture below). Others had their “driver’s license, marriage certificate, student ID and other identifying information published on Chinese social media site Weibo”644
– this practice, called doxing, is developed in a separate section (→ p. 397).

Chinese students are not the only ones targeted. Professors, university administrators, and staff members are also constantly surveilled and intimidated to make sure
that life on the campus, including teachings and research programs, is compliant with the
CCP’s line.
In the American case, a detailed report of the Wilson Center noted in 2018 that “a small
number of PRC students have infringed on the academic freedom of American university
faculty, students, administrators, and staff in recent years by: demanding the removal of
research, promotional and decorative materials involving [considered by the PRC as] sensitive content from university spaces; demanding faculty alter their language or teaching
materials involving [considered by the PRC as] sensitive content on political rather than

evidence-based grounds; interrupting and heckling other members of the university community who engage in critical discussion of China; and pressuring universities to cancel
academic activities involving [considered by the PRC as] sensitive content. PRC students
have also acted in ways that concerned or intimidated faculty, staff, and other students at
American universities by: monitoring people and activities on campus involving [considered by the PRC as] sensitive content; probing faculty for information in a suspicious manner; and engaging in intimidation, abusive conduct, or harassment of other members of the
university community.”646 This description is valid for all the countries where universities
welcome a relatively important number of Chinese students.
The University of New South Wales censored itself under Chinese pressure
On July 31, 2020, the University of New South Wales
(UNSW) published a quote from a professor at the university (who was also director of Human Rights Watch
Australia), on its Twitter account, to “bring attention to the
fast escalation of the situation in Hong Kong.” This tweet
brought about protests from Chinese students, who were
particularly numerous in this university where they amounted to close to a quarter of total enrollments, 69% of international students, and whose tuition fees equalled 22% of
the university’s budget (which, in addition, had important
deals, approximating AUS$60 million (€38 million), with
Chinese companies). This power unbalance quickly pushed
the university to its first concession, tweeting a few hours
later that “the opinions expressed by our academics do not
always represent the views of UNSW,” before deleting
both tweets. The original article where the quote was taken
from was also removed from the website – after Chinese
students asked the embassy to pressure the university.
According to the Global Times, deleting the tweets was not
enough to calm the students, who asked the university to
publish an apology.647 This deletion quickly became a national polemic, with MPs, along with
the minister for education, considering that this self-censorship infringed on the freedom of
expression and on academic freedom (which should be particularly protected in universities).
It is another example of the unacceptable influence of China on Australian campuses.648

Notably, any link with the Dalai Lama causes a systematic reaction. This is true
for countries (following a visit by the Dalai Lama in Copenhagen in 2009, Beijing froze its
bilateral relations with Denmark until the government issued a statement defending that
Denmark “was opposed to Tibet’s independence”), but also universities. When in 2009,
the University of Calgary granted the title of doctor honoris causa to the Dalai Lama, the
Chinese government retaliated by removing the university from its list of school recognized by China, which caused the departure of many Chinese students, fearing they would
not find a job in China because their degrees at the University of Calgary were no longer
recognized. Punished during two years, the University was recertified in 2011.649 When in

2017 the University of California in San Diego invited the Dalai Lama to give a conference,
the Chinese students of the university protested. On WeChat, the local CSSA (→ p. 280)
posted a statement saying they had asked for advice from the Chinese consulate and negotiated with the university’s executive body to cancel the event. On Facebook, they posted no
less than 1,600 comments, some of which accused the Dalai Lama of being a “terrorist.”650
The university did not yield, which led to an aggressive article in the Global Times suggesting
that the Chinese authorities might not deliver a visa to the president of this university or
recognize its degrees.651 A few months later, the China Scholarship Council (国家留学基
金管理委员会) froze all scholarship funding for Chinese students who wished to study at
the University of California in San Diego (see image below).

When, in 2016, in France, INALCO (the National Institute for Eastern Languages
and Civilizations) invited the Dalai Lama to give a conference, the university “received
official letters from the Embassy of China demanding that the invitation be rescinded,”
always with the barely veiled threat that what was at stake was “maintaining good relations between INALCO and China.” “They also came twice […] they are less subtle orally,” explained Françoise Robin, an INALCO professor.653 All in vain, because
INALCO did not cede – contrary to Sciences Po, who had planned to host him as
well but “cancelled his visit after an intervention of the Embassy of China.”654 At the
INALCO event, its president, Manuelle Frank, was even “on stage during the whole
conference, even though the embassy had urged her no to.”655 This time, there was no
sanction.
These interventions are not aimed at exceptional guests like the Dalai Lama only: they
are commonplace in university life, including in France, as Jean-Philippe Béja, emeritus
director of research at the CNRS and researcher at the Centre for International Studies
and Research (CERI) at Sciences Po, explains: “For the past three or four years, Chinese

students, often Communist Youth cadres, have been coming to disrupt our conferences. They are probably sent by the embassy. Others do it to make themselves look good
to the authorities.”656

c. The role of Chinese diplomats
Nationalist Chinese students are not the only actors involved: Chinese diplomats often
give them a hand. In the United States for instance, diplomats have notably “infringed on
the academic freedom of American university faculty, students, administrators, and
staff by complaining to universities about invited speakers and events; pressuring and/or
offering inducements to faculty whose work involves content deemed sensitive by the PRC
authorities.” They have also “infringed on the personal safety of people at American
universities by probing faculty and staff for information in a manner consistent with intelligence collection; and employing intimidating modes of conversation.”657
When they do not intervene directly, diplomats at least collect data. In Japan, for instance,
where there are only 115,000 Chinese students, who are also less active than in the previously mentioned countries, the embassy keeps a file on students, asking incoming
Chinese students to register to send them messages. It also gives instructions: some of
these students received an order to befriend Taiwanese students, to seduce them, to invite
them to China, to help them find a job, etc.658
In all cases, it ultimately questions the link between students and Chinese authorities.
It is certain that “Chinese students are becoming even more assertive and aggressive, taking advantage of the freedom of their host countries, and operating with
increasingly open support from the Chinese authorities,” as explained by Rowena He,
professor at St Michael’s College in Vermont.659 And yet, what does this support entail?
When they surveil, inform, intimidate, and protest, do students simply express their patriotism spontaneously or are they more or less guided by the authorities, via the embassies
and consulates? This is a crucial question insofar as, in the former case, the host country’s
universities and authorities cannot do much besides stressing and enforcing limits inherent
to the freedom of expression (which does not cover harassment, hate speech, death threats
and physical aggressions) while, in the latter case, it involves a blatant interference.
However, the fact that a counter-demonstration is not aligned with the values of the
host country, and provokes the indignation of the universities and authorities, does not
mean that it is necessarily organized by China’s agents. In fact, it is hard to tell whether
the actions of Chinese students are, in general, spontaneous or guided, first of all
because “in general” does not apply here – all cases are specific; second, because most of
the Chinese students have internalized the constraint even before they arrived in the
country where they study. As Dirk Van der Kley explained: “there is enough patriotism and
pride among Chinese students that these kinds of things are going to happen frequently,
even without [the Chinese] government direction.”660 “They are even more indoctrinated
than before,” added an interlocutor in Stockholm, “the embassies and consulates do not
even need to control them, they’re programmed.”661 In many cases, however, it is pos656. Ibid.

sible to demonstrate a command-and-control relationship between students and Chinese
authorities, via the CSSAs, the embassies and consulates. This is developed in the following
pages and in the case studies (→ p. 568).

3. Student Associations (CSSA)
In most universities in the world with a notable share of Chinese students, there is a local
branch of the Chinese Student and Scholars Association (CSSA, 中国学生学者联合
会). For instance, there are 265 CSSAs in American universities for about 300,000 Chinese
students.662 Under a façade of solidarity and kindness (they help the arriving Chinese students to adapt to their new environment, to find housing, roommates, etc.), the CSSAs
are in fact preferred platforms for United Front activities.663 They not only serve to
maintain a certain control over Chinese students abroad, but also to mobilize them if
necessary to defend China against critical opinions.
The bubble created by CSSAs around Chinese students, under the guise of helping
them, actually monitors and controls what they say, which is problematic for those who
go abroad precisely to benefit from the freedom they do not have in China. They are so
supported that “they feel they are being hosted by the Chinese government in Australia,”664
and parents who send their children to study in Australia also to allow them to make friends
abroad “are disappointed when they come back saying they only hang out with fellow
Chinese students.”665
CSSAs organize campus surveillance, the denunciation of opponents or critics,
the promotion of Beijing’s interests, the organization of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations; they also censor professors and conferences – or encourage self-censorship. In 2017, the president of the CSSA at the University of Canberra, Lu Lupin, admitted
that she “would inform the embassy if dissident Chinese students were organizing a human
rights protest.”666
They serve, in particular, as intermediaries for the authorities when they need to mobilize thousands or even tens of thousands of students for events, such as welcoming Chinese political leaders visiting the country, or to counter dissident protests.
This phenomenon is not new. In 2008, 20,000 Chinese students in Australia had been
mobilized via the CSSA to welcome the Olympic Torch in Canberra – and, in passing,
they “intimidated and punched protesters supporting Tibetan independence.”667 Similarly,
Xi Jinping’s welcome party in Washington in September 2015, with hundreds of Chinese
students aligned in the street and waving flags, was not spontaneous: the embassy went
through CSSAs to recruit 700 students, paid $20 each (remuneration distributed by CSSAs
a few months later) and, during the event, diplomats were in direct contact with them via

WeChat, “responding to messages as late as 3 a.m.”668 As reminded by Bethany AllenEbrahimian, this is far from being the only example of paid student mobilizations orchestrated via CSSAs. In the U.S. (there are other examples elsewhere), it happened for Xi’s visit
in February 2012, when he was vice-president (the embassy transfered the funds promised
to George Washington University’s CSSA only one year later), and in Chicago for the visit
of Hu Jintao in 2011.669 The Chinese Embassy in Australia also “trained hundreds of CSSA
members,” and “divided [them] into ‘security squads’” during the visit of Prime Minister
Li Keqiang in March 2017.670
Students are encouraged to commit to the CSSAs in order to please Chinese diplomats
at the embassy and/or consulates and obtain scholarships, recommendation letters, funding for extracurricular activities, and invitations to events.671 There are many testimonies
of students undergoing pressure from a CSSA to dissuade them from doing this, or on
the contrary, encourage them to do that. The permanent surveillance exerted by the
CSSAs on other students is meant to be dissuasive: its impact is translated less in terms
of sanctions impacting a few individuals but rather, in practice, by the fact that all Chinese
students are careful about what they say in public, explained Perry Link, professor at the
University of California – Riverside.672
This is an “essential element of the propaganda and a guarantee of Chinese patriotism
abroad.”673 According to Chen Yonglin, a Chinese diplomat who defected in Australia in
2005, CSSAs “are in fact controlled by the Chinese mission and are an extension
of the Chinese communist regime overseas.”674 The general association is financed in
part by the Chinese government,675 and “these organizations live in great part thanks to the
subsidies from the PRC delegations abroad.”676 Many CSSAs admit on their websites being
“registered with, or even subsidized by the local Chinese Embassy or consulate.”677 Cornell
University’s CSSA, for instance, noted on its website that it is “the ONLY Chinese student
organization officially supported by Embassy of People’s Republic of China at Cornell
University.”678 This financial relation is more or less assumed: some CSSAs do not hide
it, others visibly regret having spoken about it (see picture below). Perhaps for discretion’s
sake, the money provided by the Chinese authorities is sometimes wired not to the official
CSSA account, but to the treasurer’s personal account or to another undeclared account:
hence, the university’s administration does not know that a student organization
on its campus receives funds from a foreign government, which, in the United States
for instance, enables them to go below the radar of the Foreign Agents Registration Act
(FARA).679

“Most of CSSA operate under the guidance of Chinese embassies and consulates”680; in
fact, the People’s Daily wrote in 2013 that CSSAs in Australia “accomplish their mission […]
under the direct guidance of the Embassy’s Education Office.”681 The point of contact for the students is usually the person in charge of education at the consulate,682 given
that the Ministry for Education has many links with the United Front Work Department
(UFWD) – as illustrated by the appointment of an UFWD executive as attaché for education in Chicago between 2013 and 2016.683 The same is true for CSSAs in the United
Kingdom, Holland, Egypt, Singapore, but also in France.684 Korea University’s CSSA even
admitted on its website that the eighth bureau of the UFWD was responsible for the “general orientation of the student organizations abroad.”685 Other clues also point to links
between CSSAs and the United Front. Several CSSAs participated in a conference in
2015 to “study the spirit of the United Front’s work,” including CSSAs from Yale, Kyoto,
Princeton, Rome, universities in California, Moscow and in France.686 Furthermore, CSSAs
in the United Kingdom received a delegation from the Ministry of Education led by the
UFWD and which counted, amongst its members, the vice-director of the 6th UFWD
Bureau Duan Xiuyun (段秀云), who was also the vice-secretary of the China Overseas
Friendship Association (中华海外联谊会).687

Some nonetheless believe that “intelligence officers in diplomatic facilities are the primary point of contact for students in CSSAs”688 and that the MSS takes that opportunity
to recruit informants, if not agents, among the students.689 Some meetings are official
(each year, the Chinese Embassy in Australia invites all CSSA leaders in Australian universities to meetings at the embassy).690 Others, however, are clandestine: Frank Tian Xie,
professor at the University of South Carolina, was part of the CSSA when he arrived as a
student at Purdue University in the 1980s, and he remembered that, at the time, representatives of the Chinese consulate in Chicago met with CSSA students in motel rooms.691 For
Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya, “the embassies’ education services are
directly linked to Chinese secret services.”692 In fact, there are multiple evidence that some
CSSAs have worked with or for the MSS.693 The FBI presumably documented encounters between intelligence officers and students. As early as 2005, Le Monde revealed that the
CSSA of the Catholic University of Leuven (KUL) was involved in “a multinational network of economic intelligence overseen from Belgium.”694
Generally speaking, “CSSAs often attempt to conceal or obscure their ties to the
Chinese government, frequently omitting incriminating language from the English versions of their websites – the ones typically reviewed by university administrators.”695 The
Chinese versions are often more revealing, sometimes oversharing: in 2017 for instance, the
president of George Washington University’s CSSA explained in a promotional video that
the CSSA was “directed by the Chinese Embassy” and that it “[worked] with” the embassy.696 The CSSA at the Australian National University presented itself as “the only Chinese
student organization in Canberra officially approved by the Chinese government.”697
Chinese authorities have also expressed their gratitude, as shown by this “appreciation certificate” delivered by the consulate to a CSSA president (see below). In addition, executive
members of Swiss CSSAs are often hired by organizations dealing with Chinese influence
in the country, once their studies completed, which made Ralph Weber say that the “CSSA
could also have an important role in talent recruitment.”698

A feeling of impunity and omnipotence on foreign campuses
The Australian scholar Clive Hamilton reported that, during the summer of 2019, on the
campus of Brisbane University in Queensland, a security guard caught three men trashing
a “Lennon wall” put together to support Hong Kong protests. “The men refused to show
student IDs [and] when the guard indicated he would call the police, the leader of the group
replied: “I do not care if you call the police. I will call the Ambassador.”699 This reminded him
of another story: four years earlier, the president of the Australian National University’s CSSA
in Canberra asked who had “authorized” the campus pharmacy to sell the Epoch Times, journal
of Falun Gong, and intimidated the pharmacist until he threw them away. These examples
– and there are many more – attest of a feeling of omnipotence from some Chinese students on foreign campuses, aware of their economic weight and, thus, of the schools’
dependence on them; they are also certain of the support, and encouragements, of
Chinese authorities.

Academic communities working on China are generally divided. To only consider the German example, the community is mostly empathetic vis-à-vis Beijing, and the
few dissident voices are more often than not on the sidelines of China studies departments. The micro-community of researchers working on and in Taiwan set itself apart
from traditional German universities. In fact, a majority of researchers, shaped by interpersonal relationships they have built with their Chinese academic partners for decades,
are closer to the discourse of the business class: China is not a threat, and the point is
to try and deconstruct the prejudices and the ignorance vis-à-vis this original political
system. They hope to work on a rapprochement and dialogue (notably through academic
699. Hamilton, “Chinese Communist Party Influence in Australian Universities.”

exchange programs). The researchers considering China as a threat or those qualified as
“China-Kritiker” are in the minority in Germany, and most do not have permanent positions in German universities. The open letter published by the spouse of the Canadian
researcher Michael Kovrig, arrested and detained in China (→ p. 546), was signed by
MERICS experts, journalists, think tankers critical of China at the Deutsche Gesellschaft
für Auswärtige Politik (DGAP), but not by the crushing majority of university professors
in Germany (about forty scholars). It revealed the invisible fracture between the “ChinaVersteher” and “China-Kritiker.”700
Tensions inside the academic community and think tanks working on China are present everywhere in the world and efficiently exploited by Beijing. Besides, to control the
research published on China, and thus to model China studies, the Party-State
uses the following tools:
• Access to the field, using visas as leverage: they deny visas to researchers who are
too critical, either on a case by case basis or, as it increasingly does, as part of official sanctions, such as those enacted in March 2021. Indeed, they targeted the British
researcher Joanne Smith Finley, Assistant Professor of China studies at the University of
Newcastle; the Swedish Björn Jerdén, director of the Swedish National China Center at
the Swedish Institute of International Affairs in Stockholm: the German Adrian Zenz,
Senior Fellow in China Studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation
in the United States; and the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), the largest European research foundation on China, based in Berlin, and which hosts more
than thirty experts. These individuals “and companies and institutions associated with
them,” but also their families, are barred from visiting China, Hong Kong, and Macao,
and they can no longer do business in China. Beijing accused them of circulating “lies”
about China, on the fate of the Uyghurs but also, in the case of Jerdén, on the danger
represented by the Confucius Institutes, or, in the case of MERICS experts, for “colluding with anti-China forces.” Targeting MERICS was surprising because it was far
from the most radical research center on China; it usually followed a more moderate
line. And yet, it was “the largest Chinese research center in entire Europe. Cutting off
ties with China means its research channel will hardly be sustainable and its influence
will be critically hit,” the Global Times noted. The goal was clearly to dry up the
sources and the credibility of these individuals and institutions (first and foremost based on the researchers’ access to the field, in area studies), while intimidating
the other researchers on China elsewhere in the world. Like this young sinologist
who, under cover of anonymity precisely because he fears losing access to his research
field, reports: “We all hear about a blacklist of researchers who would no longer be
issued visas”. It does not matter whether this is true or not – it is even in Beijing’s
interest to maintain a strategic ambiguity since, when in doubt, not knowing
what their situation is and what the Chinese authorities’ tolerance threshold is,
visa applicants will censor themselves with greater zeal. The anonymous young
sinologist worries: “If tomorrow I can no longer go in the field, what legitimacy would
I have as a researcher?” And, to show his credentials, he makes sure to include at least
one official propaganda document in his bibliography – “a way to show the plurality

of entries and not to antagonize anyone,” he justifies.701 This is how self-censorship
begins and how the CCP wins.
• Financial dependence (universities financially dependent on China are less susceptible to criticize it → p. 270);
• Elite capture (gifting luxurious trips and jobs – supplementary or full-time positions
– in Chinese universities);
• Pressure by Chinese students on campuses (shaping the topics studied and the list
of guest lecturers);
• Pressure on publishers (to discourage them from publishing critical books such as
Silent Invasion by Clive Hamilton, which was rejected by several publishers by fear of
“retaliation from Beijing or from people in Australia acting in the name of the CCP”),702
and on scientific journals (→ p. 287);
• Pressure on PhD advisors (a professor at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland
received emails “from China” stating that one of her PhD students was posting “neoNazi type content” on Twitter (in reality, his account created ten days earlier and followed by less than ten people was only criticizing China’s handling of the Covid-19
pandemic); fearing “that [she] would not be able to get a visa to China afterwards,”
she sent her PhD student an email titled, “Urgent: Complaint from China about your
Twitter” and terminated the academic relationship; the student has since dropped out of
the PhD program)703;
• Pressure on relatives in China for Chinese researchers of Chinese origin or with
ties to China. For example, a professor of Chinese origin, naturalized French, working
in a French university, posted this message on a social network in May 2021: “It is too
dangerous for me to comment on the Xinjiang issue. Although I have always fought for
academic freedom and freedom of expression, I must do my best to protect the safety
of my family on the Chinese mainland”).704 For similar reasons, some professors, such
as Vanessa Frangville (a professor of China studies at the Université Libre de Bruxelles),
have given up on taking Chinese doctoral students because “either they are there for
other reasons than studying, or I am putting them in danger.”705
• Arrests and intimidations for those with access to their field in China. In 2017,
Feng Chongyi, a permanent resident in Australia who holds a professorship at the
University of Technology, Sydney, was completing a three-week research field trip to
southern China, during which he had met with human rights defenders, among others,
when he was detained by the authorities, questioned, and held for one week. Another
example: a doctoral student from a Belgian university “was detained” during a trip in
China “and interrogated for three days in a hotel room. The Chinese services had a huge

• Kidnappings, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, forced televised “confessions”
of activists, journalists, publishers, critics of Beijing;
• Lawsuits (or the threat of it) such as the ones that targeted the Canadian J. Michael
Cole, the French Valérie Niquet, or the German Adrian Zenz; this is the lawfare strategy
introduced in the first part of the report (→ p. 53). Beijing does not care about winning
a trial, but aims to impose a cost on the target and to intimidate the others.
• And finally, stemming from all of the above, self-censorship.
Influencing publishers, printers and booksellers
In August 2017, the British publisher Cambridge University Press (CUP) blocked access to over 300 online articles from China Quarterly to residents of Chinaat the request
of the Chinese authorities because they covered topics considered sensitive by Beijing,
including the cultural revolution, Tian’anmen, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan.707 The General
Administration of Press and Publications (→ p. 193) made the request, providing the list of all
the articles to remove. CUP yielded to be able to continue publishing in China: “[we] do not,
and will not, proactively censor our content and will only consider blocking individual items
(when requested to do so) when the wider availability of content is at risk.”708 In other words,
publishers yield to what they perceived as the lesser of two evils, because Beijing gave
them the choice between removing the contentious articles or blocking their overall
distribution. Following the scandal that this case brought about, (academics rallied against
the decision), CUP went back on its decision, and a few days later, reestablished access to the
articles in question. The Chinese authorities then asked CUP to block certain articles from the
American Political Science Review which they did not do.709
This example is not isolated. In November 2017, the German publisher Springer Nature
blocked access from China to at least 1,000 articles, at the request of the Chinese government.710 In September 2018, at Beijing’s request, the British publisher Taylor and Francis
removed from its offer in China (its pack “arts, humanities and social sciences” sold to
libraries) 83 journals with content deemed “inappropriate,” including the Asian Studies Review.
More recently, in France, a Chinese university asked the portal Cairn, which distributes online
journals, to withdraw the December 2020 issue of the journal Esprit, containing a dossier on
China, which Cairn refused to do.711
Even children’s publishing is targeted. In March 2021, at the request of the Chinese consulate in Hamburg, which threatened legal action, the German publisher Carlsen-Verlag withdrew from sale an illustrated children’s book (Ein Corona-Regenbogen für Anna und Moritz) that
had become the target of Chinese authorities and media (citing a request from the “Chinese
community” in Germany712) because it described the coronavirus as “originating in China”.
The publisher is preparing a new, corrected edition.713
Book publications are also concerned, which are often far less expensive in China (45%
less expensive than in New Zealand for a book in color with illustrations on glassy paper for
instance),714 which gives Beijing yet more leverage: some Chinese printers take it upon
themselves to censor, sometimes reject, foreign books meant for foreign publics. For
instance, one of them produced a list of keywords that publishers needed to avoid, while an

Australian publisher eventually renounced having an atlas for children printed in China after
the Chinese printer rejected one of its maps.715
Finally, what the above demonstration shows is that Beijing’s objective is to influence
writings at every stage: not only their production (by trying to influence authors through
incentives and pressures, pushing them to censor themselves for instance) but also their
distribution, by trying to influence publishers and printers. It also includes the last stage
which, for books, is their sales in bookstores. Here the story of the Thalia bookstore chain
in Germany is telling. In September 2020, a customer posted photos on Facebook of the
particularly large and propagandistic China section of a Thalia bookstore in Berlin, highlighting in particular the works of President Xi Jinping and significantly lacking in publications critical of the Party. It thus drew attention to a practice that was not new (a year earlier, a Taiwanese from Berlin had also reported it on Facebook, but in Chinese, so without
causing a German reaction in the media). This time, Thalia had to react and explain itself by
acknowledging that it had rented some space in some of its stores to China Book Trading,
a German subsidiary of the China International Publishing Group (CIPG), an organization
dependent on the Party’s Propaganda Department.716 These rental contracts are neither illegal nor unusual, but in this case, the nature of the client introduced an important bias in
the presentation of books from and about a country.717 The German press denounced such
“propaganda” in the country’s bookstores. “Chinese propaganda is much more effective
in Germany when it is distilled by people, media or even reputable companies like Thalia,”
explains researcher Mareike Ohlberg.718

A survey carried out in 2018 among more than 500 experts on China showed that
repression was a “rare but real phenomenon and collectively present a barrier to the conduct of research in China.”719 The identified restrictions belonged to three categories:
restrictions on access to China (visa refusal or delay in deliverance: “the Chinese govern715. Ibid.
716. CIPG is a “body subordinate to the central authorities” (“中央所属事业单位”) and its activity is controlled
by the Propaganda Department. See for example the Baidu page dedicated to CIPG: https://urlz.fr/gr8X.

ment does restrict visa access for work it considers potentially problematic,” in gradation:
difficulties in obtaining a visa, denial of a visa, blacklisting)720; restrictions on access to
material or research topics (deniedaccess to archives, deleted questions during interviews,
cancelled interviews); surveillance and intimidation (questioning by the authorities, confiscated equipment, including computers – these issues happen everywhere in China, but
even more so when a researcher goes to sensitive regions such as Xinjian and Tibet).721 For
70% of the respondents “self-censorship is a problem in the China study field.”722
Another article based on over a hundred interviews in American universities spoke of
“an epidemic of self-censorship at U.S. universities on the subject of China.”723
Considering the lack of resources in most universities, many students are tempted to reorient their research in a direction that satisfies Beijing in order to have access to the field and
receive funding. “It has gotten to the point where I do not engage with anything overly
political relating to the Chinese state,” explained, for instance, a graduate student at a top
American university.724 A common, and even encouraged, reaction: “I frequently hear graduate students and younger scholars – people with academic jobs but pre-tenure – being
advised not to explore sensitive subjects in their research, so they can preserve visa access,”
an American historian on China testified.725 But this self-censorship has consequences: it
“restricts the ability of U.S. policymakers, businesspeople, human rights advocates, and the
general public to make smart decisions about how to interact with China.”726
Self-censorship is made stronger by blurry red lines: Beijing has not created a guide
explaining what to say or what not to say, it is up to everyone’s best guess. This ambiguity is
strategic: it prompts even more self-censorship to avoid the risk of crossing limits that are
not clearly defined.
That being said, the more China extends its influence over the world, the more it
becomes possible to study China outside of China: researchers who no longer go to
mainland China do a lot of field research in Honk Kong (less since 2019), in Taiwan, in
Korea, Mongolia, etc. And the more Beijing becomes aggressive toward foreign researchers, increasing the risks for them to run into issues in China, if not being arrested, accused
of espionage, etc., the more acceptable it becomes for scholars to do field research outside
of China. Not only is it increasingly difficult to learn anything in China (due to self-censorship and wooden language), but it makes sense for personal security reasons. Moreover,
with the conditions that Beijing requires to grant access to its territory, i.e. no criticism of
the Party, it becomes more legitimate not to go there anymore, if only not to give up
one’s ability to be critical, and in fine to ensure that the research is independent. Hence this
“internationally renowned researcher” quoted by the newspaper Libération who “explains
that she has renounced doing field research [in China], precisely to preserve this freedom
of speech”727. This is obviously easier to do for researchers who are already well known, or
in any case who are not in a precarious professional situation, than for young researchers
who are more fragile and insecure.

5. Acquiring knowledge and technologies
Another major CCP interest for foreign universities comes from the acquisition
of knowledge and technologies, through legal and unconcealed means: joint
research programs (leading to joint publications, the number of which continues to
grow, as shown by the British example with less than 100 articles co-published before
1990, 750 in 2000, 3,324 in 2010 and 16,267 in 2019728) or illegal and concealed means
such as theft and espionage by Chinese students or researchers integrated in foreign
teams, or from a distance (cyberattacks). Joint research programs, and more generally
research field trips in China are all the more tempting for researchers and visiting professors because Chinese universities – or at least some of them – have significant resources
and state-of-the-art equipment that most home institutions do not have. This is true of
France, where “the lack of recognition and means in the laboratories” was quickly
identified by Beijing as an “Achilles heel”, i.e. an opportunity. The Party has had
no trouble catching the attention and skills of French students and scientists for whom,
as Antoine Bondaz explains, China is “a paradise: brand new labs, significant financial
resources and a plethora of research support teams.”729 The attraction is less strong in the
best-endowed French laboratories, which is why “Beijing seeks to establish itself in
priority in medium-sized universities, far from the metropolises. This is where the
lack of resources – and therefore the real or potential bitterness of teachers – is
more acute. Poitiers, Angers, Arras, Pau. These are the same faculties where Confucius
institutes are often found.” (→ p. 299)730
Concerning theft and espionage, universities are not the only targets. Companies
in strategic sectors are also targeted, with the same tactics and more, including the
seduction of executives by female agents, going as far as marriage. “Weddings are another
one of the means used by Beijing to catch up on its technological gap in some sectors. In
2009, the DGSE brought the proof that a young Chinese woman, in a relationship with
one of the leaders of the EADS group with secret defense accreditation, was transmitting
confidential documents to her country’s secret services.”731

a. Many recruiting programs
In this context, China developed numerous talents recruitment programs which, for
the CCP, is a “form of technology transfer.”732 Alex Joske, in his report Hunting the Phoenix
(2020) – “phoenix”, because this practice is sometimes described in China as “building
nests to attract phoenixes”733 – counted about 200 of them, according to a list published
in 2018 by the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs (which is now part of the
Ministry of Science and Technology), while noting that the real number was “probably
much greater.”734 This practice was developed during the 1980s, with a clear acceleration in
the 2000s. Most of these programs are controlled by local governments, in the provinces,

municipalities and counties735 – but they are coordinated by several central organizations,
including, since 2003, the Central Coordination Group for Talent Work (中央人才工作
协调小组). According to official Chinese numbers, the sole programs run by the local
governments enabled the recruitment of 53,900 foreign researchers between 2008
and 2016, to which are added the national programs, including the Thousand Talents Plan
(→ p. 292) and Hundred Talents Plan, which brought 7,000 researchers during the same
period.736
These programs cover all activities, from legal and unconcealed actions to illegal and concealed ones, and the grey area in between. Concretely, they are based on
“talent-recruitment stations” abroad, in the countries currently the most technologically
advanced. The United States is the priority target, with 146 identified stations, then comes
Germany (57), Australia (57), the United Kingdom (49), Canada (47), France (46), Australia
(46), Singapore (21), New-Zealand (13), and Sweden (12).737 Overall, Alex Joske identified
600 stations, and believed there were likely more than that. They have existed since 2006,
and have increased exponentially after 2015.
Composed of a few individuals, these stations are more often than not integrated in existing organizations linked to the UFWD (business offices for Chinese
abroad, or other community, student, or professional organizations, companies in the
education or technology sectors, or, in at least one case, to a Confucius Institute, etc.),
which is paid extra for this activity: up to RMB150,000 (€18,700) per year for the
running costs and up to RMB200,000 (€25,000) per recruited individual, according to
Alex Joske.738

They are tasked, not only with recruiting and bringing potential candidates to
China, but also with collecting data on the scientists and research programs in the
countries in which they are based. For instance, the stations abroad affiliated with the
city of Qingdao received the instruction to collect data on at least “fifty individuals per
year, of a level at least equivalent to that of associate professor, researcher or company
manager.” The objective was 100 individuals and “at least as many innovation projects”
for those of the city of Tianjin. This data is then compiled and amounts to millions of
profiles: in 2017, a Chinese think tank had established a base of 6.5 million scientific
profiles in the world. The Thousand Talents think tank (千人智库), tied to the plan of
the same name, “claims to hold data on 12 million overseas scientists, including 2.2
million ethnic Chinese scientists and engineers.”740 These stations do not only relay information, they may also “receive instructions to target individuals with access to specific
technologies.”741
The most famous program is the Thousand Talents (千人计划), which “has poured
billions of dollars into drawing in tens of thousands of foreign specialists to China and
sends out thousands of Chinese scientists overseas to access the latest technology and
knowhow.”742 Created in 2008, its implementation is supervised by the High-Level Working
Group on Overseas Talent Recruitment (海外高层次人才引进工作小组) which depends
on the Central Committee of the CCP. Initially conceived to attract Chinese talents living
abroad, it was extended to foreign citizens in 2011. Beijing offers prestigious positions in
Chinese universities and high salaries. An advertisement placed in the scientific journal
Nature in January 2018 thus explained that “all successful applicants can expect a 1 million
yuan [126 000 €] starting bonus, and the opportunity to apply for a research fund of 3–5
million yuan [378 000 – 630 000 €]. Foreign scientists receive additional incentives, such as
accommodation subsidies, meal allowances, relocation compensation, paid-for visits home
and subsidized education costs. Employers are also obliged to find jobs for foreign spouses,
or provide an equivalent local salary.”743
That being said, living in China is not necessary – on the contrary, it can be quite
advantageous for both parties not to relocate and leave scientists in their home country.
A short-term version of the Thousand Talents Plan exists, allowing the recipients to stay
abroad and only spend two months in China each year, which “enables them to maintain
multiple appointments at once, which may not be fully disclosed. This may mean that
they’re effectively using time, resources and facilities paid for by their home institutions to
benefit Chinese institutions.”744
Alex Joske mentioned the case of Prof. Steven X. Ding (丁先春) from the University of
Duisburg (Germany), who received an affiliation to Tianjin University (China). It showed
the advantage for China to have him abroad: “I manage scientific research at the university,
which has more than 100 projects supervised by me […]. I can serve as a bridge between
China and Germany for technological exchange … and I can make greater contributions
than if I returned to China on my own. Being in Germany I can introduce advanced tech-

nologies to China, assist communication, exchange and cooperation, and play a role as a
window and a bridge [between China and Germany].”745
Many targets are of Chinese origin (the Party can present these programs “as serving
the country’s ethno-nationalist rejuvenation”).746 One of the most recent example is Gong
Chen, born in China, naturalized American, and a mechanical engineering professor at the
prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was arrested in January 2021
for failing to disclose “that he was acting as an overseas expert on science and technology for the Chinese communist government after China’s consulate office in New York
asked him to provide expertise and advice in exchange for financial compensation and
awards.” He allegedly received $29 million in foreign funding, mainly from China, and at
least $355,000 for his “services and expertise.”747
However, the targets are not always of Chinese descent, as attested by the case of
Charles Lieber, chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard
University, who was arrested in 2020 because he hid the fact that he combined his position
at Harvard with a job as a “Strategic Scientist” at the Wuhan University of Technology
between 2012 and 2017, as part of the Thousand Talents, and that he received a monthly
salary of $50,000 from China, with an additional grant reaching RMB1 million and a funding of RMB1.5 million (€190,000) to create a joint lab between Harvard and Wuhan.748
Among the other programs, there is Project 111, which is meant to recruit 1,000 researchers from the 100 best universities in the world; the Peacock Program (孔雀计划) of
the Shenzhen government “which seeks to attract global talent ranging from Nobel Prize
winners and winners of other major academic prizes, senior executives of the world’s top
500 companies or of international financial organizations, members of the International
Standardization Organization (ISO) Standards Committee, university presidents, heads of
academic associations such as the Royal Society, foreign experts who have won a Friendship
Award, editors of leading scientific journals, actuaries, medical specialists, and Olympic
coaches.”749 The PLA also used Horizon 2020, the 2014-2020 European program for
research and development, in order to “gain access to international military technology.”750
On a different note, the “Gray Temples” program “aims to pamper very young retirees or executives at the end of their careers to benefit from their knowledge. ‘This mainly
concerns researchers or engineers,’ noted a French scholar. ‘The Chinese invite them to
seminars, pay the plane fare and the hotel expenses, it’s nice. And, if it goes well, they can
be offered funding for their research.’”751

b. Programs that raise a lot of issues
These programs bring about many issues. First, the copyrights of all research produced,
even those co-financed or financed by programs in other countries, have to be registered
in China.752 Furthermore, these programs often serve as a cover and channel for economic espionage, fraud, and theft pure and simple. In the annex of his report, Alex

Joske enumerated a number of researchers that benefited from these programs and were
arrested and convicted for one of these reasons.753
Finally, among the Chinese universities involved, those linked to the defense and security
sectors are over-represented: recruited researchers in fact develop Chinese military
capabilities. The modernization of the PLA owes a lot to “an international technology
transfer strategy, which includes academic exchanges, investment in foreign companies,
espionage, and hacking.”754
For instance, one of the recruiting stations in Australia is located within the Northwestern
Polytechnic University Alumni Association (西北工业大学, NPU), which has developed
numerous links with Australian universities, and famously bragged about having presented
no less than five professors from Melbourne at the NPU in less than a month. However, the
NPU is one of the main universities in the defense sector in China, specialized in aviation,
space, and naval technology; it is one of the China’s “Seven Sons of National Defense”
(国防七子), which regroup the seven most important universities in the defense sector.755
Over 41% of its graduates are employed in that sector.756 Another example: in 2014, the
Chinese Academy of Engineering and Physics (中国工程物理研究院, CAEP), which is
the main school for research on nuclear weapons, had already recruited no less than 57
researchers through the Thousand Talents programs.757 The number of scientists from
the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory that have been recruited by Chinese institutions is so important that “they’re reportedly known as the ‘Los Alamos Club.’”758
Some assume that tie, such as this “Australian participant in the Thousand Talents program speaking of his duty to contribute to the development of China’s national defense,”759
while others would rather ignore or hide it, which is, in and of itself, another problem.
Often, recruited individuals fail to disclose it. An investigation at A&M University in
Texas found more than 100 staff members “linked to China’s talent programs, but only five
disclosed it despite employees being required to do so.”760 The Thousand Talents Plan however, allows its recipients to be considered as entrepreneurs with one or more companies in
China that are supported by the Thousand Talents Plan Venture Capital Center (千人计划
创投中心). It is through such a ploy that a start-up born in an Australian university lab
and financed by it provided the Chinese government with the surveillance technology used against Uyghurs, unbeknownst to the university (see box).

When Australia indirectly contributes to the repression of Uyghurs
Heng Tao Shen, a talented computer scientist appointed professor at the University of
Queensland in 2011 at 34, was recruited three years later by a Chinese university (University
of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)) as part of the Thousand Talents
program. He then founded a start-up in artificial intelligence, Koala AI, while maintaining
his links to UQ, where he stayed as honorary professor. He used these links to poach several Australians for Koala AI, including researchers at UNSW, UQ, and at the University of
Melbourne. Koala AI expanded considerably and was worth more than a billion dollars in
2020. Among its activities, the company provided the Chinese government with a surveillance
system installed at the border with Kazakhstan, through which many Uyghurs fled the Chinese
repression, to detect and categorize potentially suspect individuals and vehicles. Koala AI also
managed a joint lab with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security. This sparked a scandal in
Australia because Heng Tao Shen benefited, when he was a researcher there, from public funding (AUS$2.6 million from the Australian Research Council), of which more than half (1.6
million) was used after he founded Koala AI, to finance research on surveillance technology
that are now used in Xinjiang.761

The civil-military fusion, i.e. the policy aiming to develop links between the civilian and military sectors to help China’s economic and military growth, was developed by Hu Jintao in 2007 and Xi Jinping made it a national strategy; he personally heads
the Central Committee for the Development of Military – Civil Fusion (中央军民融合
发展委员会).762 Concretely, it means that many Chinese civilian universities contribute to
military research, if not to some activities: “[at] least 15 civilian universities have been
implicated in cyberattacks, illegal exports or espionage.”763
The situation for the many foreign universities sharing sometimes tight links with Chinese
institutions is problematic insofar as, through research projects or joint articles, exchanges
between researchers, they may indirectly contribute to the development of the PLA
and to the elaboration of surveillance, control, and oppression technologies used
against the Chinese population. Several scandals have burst in recent years, such as
when Australia was accused of indirectly contributing to repression of Uyghurs (see box).
Furthermore, in February 2021, The Times revealed that close to 200 British researchers
working in a dozen British universities were suspected to be involuntarily helping Beijing
build weapons of mass destruction by transferring sensitive military technologies.764
Considering the extent of collaborations with China, and the Chinese civil-military interweaving, this type of scandals will presumably be on the rise in the next few years.
Alex Joske (ASPI) was key in drawing attention to this risk with his famous report Picking
Flowers, Making Honey (2018),765 followed by The China Defense Universities Tracker (2019)
and Hunting the Phoenix (2020).766 In January 2021, Joske also submitted a report on CCP

efforts in terms of talent recruitment in Australia to the Parliamentary Joint Committee
on Intelligence and Security in which he explained that he had identified, in Australian
research institutions, including some government bodies, no less than 325 participants in
the Chinese talent recruitment programs.767 Similar research also looked at New Zealand,768
the U.S.,769 and the Czech Republic.770
In 2019, Alex Joske created a database of Chinese research institutions, both military and civilian, classified based on the risk they represent. This China Defence
Universities Tracker (https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/) proves very useful for foreign universities and researchers, but also for public and private leaders, to evaluate the risk incurred
– included the reputational risk – by an association with certain Chinese institutions. Using
this database, Sinopsis and Czech Radio (Český rozhlas) noted that “14 out of 26 Czech public universities have established collaboration with [Chinese] civilian universities the ASPI
database assigns medium to very high risk.”771
Likewise, a note of the Embassy of France in China, quoted by Le Point, noted that it was
problematic that “French institutions signed agreements with more than a dozen Chinese
universities tied to the military-industrial complex” while another note indicated than
“twenty French academics had been recruited [by the Thousand Talents program] including eight that “continue to hold a permanent position in their home institution in France
at the same time.” The note continued by stressing that some “are susceptible to communicate particularly sensitive information.” Hence, France seems to be growing aware of the
problem. The French MEP Nathalie Loiseau, who coordinates the Special Committee on
Foreign Interference, defended that “we should start by imposing transparency. Omitting
to declare [these positions] should be considered as an infraction.”772
These activities raised international concern, in particular from the American government, Beijing has been concealing the Thousand Talents program as much as possible since September 2018. A directive signed on September 29, 2018 (see below) asked the
recruiters to “stop using emails, and opt for the phone and fax instead, during the recruitment process. Candidates have to be notified at the occasion of an invitation to attend a
university conference or a forum in China. The written notifications cannot include the
words ‘Thousand Talents Plan.’”773 The process thus increasingly resembles the practice of
intelligence services.

Previously-public data was deleted: universities stopped mentioning the program on their
websites; the list of recipients was deleted from the websites of the Chinese government, including the program’s official website 1000plan.org774; and the website of the program itself, created
in 2010, seems to no longer be functioning in its English version (since February 2020) and even
in its Chinese version (since March 2020). Beijing is now laying low but, as explained by AnneMarie Brady, the “Thousand Talents continues, as do around 200 similar recruitment
plans aimed at transmitting foreign research expertise to China.”775

c. Strategic infrastructures: the example of the China-Belgium Technology Center (CBTC)
CBTC is “the first Chinese hi-tech science park in Europe,”776 with construction
beginning in 2017. Strategically located 30 minutes from Brussels, close to several universities, the center is built in the Louvain-la-Neuve science park, which is home to
some 20 Chinese and European companies in the life sciences, information and high-tech
industry sectors. The British pharmaceutical company GSK Vaccines is also located nearby.
The main shareholder and project leader is United Investment Europe (UI Europe), a
Belgian subsidiary of the Chinese company United Investment Group from Hubei.777
The project partners are the Catholic University of Leuven (UCLouvain), the Walloon
Export and Foreign Investment Agency (AWEX) and the Intercommunale du Brabant
Wallon (InBW). The total investment for this project would amount to 200 million euros.778
According to UCLouvain, the project has received political endorsements from both
countries. It has been validated by the highest authorities of both states: President Xi
Jinping and former Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo both attended the signing ceremony of the framework agreement at its launch in 2014.

According to its website, the CBTC has three missions: “to build offices, laboratories and infrastructure to host European and Chinese companies; to help them enter and
expand in their respective markets by offering support services; and to invest in economic
development and job creation.” The CBTC offers services to facilitate cooperation between
European and Chinese high-tech companies and to facilitate their entry and development
in their respective markets (company creation, market analysis, tax studies, recruitment,
legal support, etc.). The three sectors on which the CBTC focuses are life sciences, information and communication technologies, and smart manufacturing.779
The CBTC will also have a “privileged connection with the Leuven Innovation Network
ecosystem,” a network composed of UCLouvain, the Leuven Technology Transfer Office
(LTTO), the VIVES – Leuven Technology fund, the UCLouvain incubators, the Louvainla-Neuve Enterprise and Innovation Center and the Brussels Life Science Incubator,
Mind&Market as well as the UCLouvain science parks.780
The CBTC construction project – which includes offices, coworking spaces, conference
centers, hotel, parking and convenience stores – is divided into three phases, at the end of
which the center is expected to be able to accommodate about 100 companies and 800
jobs on 120,000 square meters.781 The first phase was launched in 2017 and completed
in 2020. In September 2020 and with the help of real estate agencies Allten and Hendrix,
the spaces began to be rented.782 Several Chinese companies – including the Traditional
Chinese Medicine science and Technology Industrial park (Guangdong & Macau), China
Medical City (Taizhou), Shanghai Zhangjiang Science Park, Hainan International Medical
Pilot Zone, Nanjing Qixia Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone – have already signed
agreements to set up operations there.783

Chinese services, it could be used as an entry point by MSS agents for future espionage
operations. There are precedents. According to confidential VSSE reports from 2010 to
2016, revealed in part by EUobserver, Chinese intelligence services have a particular interest in biological warfare and vaccines.784 The VSSE suspects that China has
targeted several Belgian experts as well as the British pharmaceutical company GSK. The
Center of Applied Molecular Technology (CTMA), also located in the science park
of Louvain-la-Neuve, would have been targeted. The Belgian authorities were concerned
about the location of two Chinese structures in the same building as the CTMA, the Beijing
ZGC Science Park and Shenzhen European Office. From now on, the China-Belgium
Technology Center (CBTC) will also be located nearby.

Chinese language is one of the main vectors of the CCP’s strategy
of seduction. Not only does language gives an access to the Chinese
culture and to Chinese people themselves, which constitutes a powerful
motivation for the learners, but it is also used by the CCP to create a
narrative, a mystification built around its age and its graphic peculiarities,
where the act and art of writing are intertwined. This influence strategy
was materialized by the opening of a constellation of Confucius
Institutes since 2004, tasked with promoting the Chinese language and culture.

1. Organization
There are two categories of Confucius Institutes: the institutes themselves,
implanted in the universities, and the Confucius Classrooms, present mainly in institutions
of primary and secondary education. These institutions can obtain the support, and coordinate their actions with, the Chinese cultural centers at the embassies, but they are administrated by the Hanban (汉办), which stands for the Office of Chinese Language Council
International (国家汉语国际推广领导小组办公室). The Hanban is not an agency per se,
but an organization affiliated to the Ministry of Education. The Hanban permanent committee is however presided by Sun Chunlan (孙春兰), vice-prime minister, member of the
CCP’s Political Bureau and former manager of the United Front Department. The director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (侨务办公室) is also in the committee; if the
OCAO was formerly attached to the State Council, it was integrated into the United Front
Department in 2018. Hence, there is no doubt about the Party’s control over the activities
of Confucius Institutes.
The implementation of Confucius Institutes (CI) abroad is based on a tripartite agreement that includes the Hanban, the foreign university that hosts the institute in its
facilities and a Chinese university that graciously provides the language teachers. The
financial support offered by the Hanban through the ICs does not only include the learning
material and teachers but, since 2009, it offers scholarships to allow foreigners to come
to China to study Chinese and its culture. Between 2009 and 2020, about 50,000 students
from 166 countries received such a scholarship.785 For example, in Kenya, it is estimated that

the CI in Nairobi alone awards at least 15 scholarships per year to African students to study in
China for 6 months and up to 10 years – potentially to a doctorate level. It also offers specific
language courses for Kenyan officials, including diplomats and customs officers.786
The institutes are managed by a tandem formed by a Chinese and a local co-director,
while all the other employees seem to consistently be Chinese. When a university accepts to
welcome a CI, it receives a financial assistance of a variable amount to launch its activities, an annual grant amounting to $100,000 or $150,000 on average, although it could reach
several million dollars according to certain sources. The Hanban then recruits and trains
the new teachers who are appointed to the institutes solely based on the Hanban’s decision.
But, once there, they can receive instructions from the embassy or the consulate. The
linguistic resources (books, audio or video media) are also elaborated by the Hanban.
CIs have grown rapidly: the first opened in Seoul in November 2004, the first in Africa at
the University of Nairobi in 2005, and the first Confucius Classroom in 2006 in a Bangkok
high school. South Korea and Thailand remain the Asian countries with the largest numbers
of Confucius Institutes and Classrooms. At the end of 2009, there were 282 Institutes, and
272 Classrooms in 88 countries,787 and the objective was to reach a thousand by 2020.788 Their
number has stagnated globally since 2018 however (the official Hanban website mentions
541 but this number has not changed in years even though some CIs have closed while others
have been created –the Hanban is likely intentionally ambiguous about the real number of
CIs).789 If we go by the facts mentioned on the official website, there would be 135 CIs in Asia
(25%), 61 in Africa (11%) 138 in the Americas (25%), 187 in Europe (35%) and 20 in Oceania
(4%). The three countries with the most Confucius Institutes are the United States (75 institutes, including 65 on university campuses, and approximatively 500 Classrooms in August
2020),790 the United Kingdom and Australia (14 Institutes and 67 Classrooms in Australia
in July 2019).791 This massive expansion allowed the Party to multiply the number of
Chinese learners and to extend its influence everywhere in the world.
In France, CIs allow Beijing to strengthen its influence in medium-sized cities,
where they are mainly located. There are 18 of them in the country, where they “lead a
seemingly quiet life” as Nathalie Guibert explains, having travelled around France to study
these “ever so discreet Chinese relays.”792 These institutes appeal not only to universities but also to local political actors who, fully aware of the links between CIs
and the Party, hope to be able to use them as communication channels to develop
business relations, as a deputy mayor of Angers acknowledges: “The CIs are considered
by Chinese actors to have the seal of the Party, with validated executives, which allows us
to get things across better. We want a return other than cultural, the Institute must also
promote business.”793 Their establishment is encouraged by the widely shared feeling
of an inevitable Chinese domination. It is the discourse according to which “China is
moving fast, it is overtaking us in terms of technology. It is going to become a superpower,
the question is how to work better with it,” as expressed in particular by the French co-di786. From a diplomatic source.

rector of the Confucius Business at the Ecole supérieure de commerce de Paris.794 This
approach, both fatalistic and opportunistic, is certainly debatable – primarily because it
seems to ignore the risks of such cooperation – but the fact is that it is widespread. The
academic Gilles Guiheux, former co-director of Paris’s CI, concludes that “the problem
with Confucius Institutes is that they spread a false image of China. But we are
partly responsible for this. The actors of the French network adhere to the idea of an
unstoppable Chinese power.”795
The Confucius Institute project in Greenland
CIs allow China to increase its penetration in certain regions where it has little presence at
the moment but identifies important current or future interests, such as in Greenland. China
manifested a renewed interest for Greenland after the adoption of a self-governing act in 2008
which gave the territory more autonomy from the Danish government, and notably, the possibility to conclude deals with other countries. The Chinese presence in Greenland is first motivated by the abundance of natural resources (illustrated by investment in the mining sector for
instance), the infrastructure market (ports, airports, hydraulic etc.),796 and scientific research:
Beijing wishes to establish research stations dedicated, for instance, to climate change.797 That
being said, the CCP envisions its penetration in Greenland within the scope of its Arctic strategy which, since the arrival to power of Xi Jinping and the rise of tensions with the United
States, has explicitly become geopolitical and not merely economic.
The continuing Chinese presence in Greenland necessarily goes through a more in-depth penetration of the indigenous society, and particularly its elite. Since 2016, it has led to a cooperation agreement between the cities of Shanghai and Kujalleq (at the southern end of the territory) in order to
open a CI in 2018 on the Qaoqortoq campus. A well-conducted targeting of the local elite, which is
quantitatively unimportant, could allow to a rapid increase in the influence of Beijing.798 However,
for unknown reasons, the project of a CI in Greenland seems to have aborted.

2. The true nature of Confucius Institutes
CI defenders generally present them as harmless language schools, similar to the Alliances
françaises, the British Councils and the Goethe Institutes. However, and even if it were the
case, we must remember with the Tibet specialist Françoise Robin that “even with language courses, one can convey political ideas, such as showing maps of China that include
Taiwan.”799 Additionaly, and most importantly, CIs are in fact fundamentally different, starting with their politicization: contrary to the aforementioned cultural diplomacy institutions,
which are particularly careful not to have any link to a political party, CIs are inherently
linked to the CCP.
Another difference: their implementation in universities and other foreign educational institutions “gives them leverage over the host institutions.”800 There was

even a case of an implantation at the heart of the education policy of a target country:
the Ministry of Education of New-South Wales hosted a CI – a case presented as unique
in the world.801 In other words, Beijing had appointed employees (potentially agents)
inside an Australian ministry. This institute operated a Confucius Classroom program
which state schools paid at least $10,000 annually (plus material resources such as books,
which were graciously offered) to propose Chinese language and culture classes. Some
schools subsequently made them mandatory. This decision shocked many parents, some
describing this program “as the infiltration of the Chinese Communist Party into the NSW
public school system.”802 Following this polemic, the state decided to stop the program in
December 2019.
Over the past couple of years, China’s efforts have faced an increasing opposition
that has put a stop, or at least slowed, the implementation of new institutions. Several universities have also decided to shut down the Confucius Institutes they hosted, invoking, in
particular, an infringement of academic freedom. In July 2020, at least 50 universities in
9 countries stopped the activities of CIs implanted on their campuses – for instance, the
University of Chicago and Penn State in the United States, McMaster in Canada or Lyon in
France (→ p. 305). In the United States, at least 15 of them closed in 2018-2019.803 In
Australia, the state of New South Wales announced, in August 2019, the closure of the 13
Cis in its public schools.804 In Germany, the universities of Düsseldorf and Hamburg have
terminated CIs they hosted, and in several cities, including Ingolstadt and Göttingen, citizens’ collectives have been formed to end public subsidies or cooperation with local CIs.805
In response to Chinese sanctions against researchers and a German think tank (MERICS)
in March 2021, the University of Trier announced the suspension of all activities of its CI,
a decision which the Minister of Research welcomed a few months later by stating: “I do
not want the Chinese government to influence our universities and our society. Germany
must admit self-critically: in some places in the past, we have given too much space to
the Confucius Institutes, and have done too little ourselves to build up independent
China expertise in Germany.”806 Everywhere in the world, the problems have multiplied and CIs are shut down.
The problems stemming from CIs have been summarized by a very thorough study of
the National Association of Scholars (NAS) in 2017.807 The most frequent criticisms leveled
against them referred to the pressure exerted on teachers to avoid subjects deemed sensitive
in class (Tibet, Taiwan, Xinjiang, Human Rights, etc.), the restrictions on the teachers’ freedom of expression and of religion (prohibition of Falun Gong for instance808) and a lack,
or very little, of transparence on the nature of the relations between the institutes and the
Hanban or other Chinese administrations.

• 1) Teachers. At the end of 2016, the CI headquarters in Beijing designed new recruitment criteria for teachers, first implemented in early 2017. They required “good
political and professional qualities” (“具备良好的政治和业务素质”) and a “love
for the homeland” (“爱祖国”) for instance.809 The word sushi (素质), often translated
by “quality” encompasses the behavior, ethic, and education of the individual. It is a
marker of belonging to the civilized world. To lack of suzhi is to not be “civilized”; the
word is thus often used to endorse a paternalistic politics or the refusal to hold elections
to choose the country’s leaders, under the pretext that rural people are not of “good
enough quality.”810 According to the former Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin, who had
defected to Australia in 2005, to have a “good political quality” means in this context to
“always be faithful to the CCP and nothing else.”811

The required candidate profile: “good political and professional qualities, loves the homeland, works voluntarily for the
internationalization of the Chinese language, has a dedicated spirit, a strong sense of organizational discipline and team spirit,
with good character and no criminal record.”812

• 2) The learning material. The learning material is prepared by the Hanban and
compliant with a Chinese vision of the world. It is actually a preferred resource to
convey the Party’s narrative abroad. The work is, in this case, eased by the young age
of this “literature’s” public, the children and teenagers, not yet able to confront the
propaganda that, despite lacking in subtlety sometimes, can be effective due to the repetition of the same message. The ability of some students to defend themselves against
such assaults can also be questioned. Here, the Chinese strategy can be illustrated by
an animated documentary on the Korean War (1950-53), the War to Resist US
Aggression and Aid Korea,813 proposed by the Hanban to young learners. The
video explained that the United States manipulated the United Nations Security Council
and that the Chinese army only went to war in response to the American bombings of
Chinese villages and in order to protect the homeland (see screenshots below). The
Hanban removed the video once its content was exposed.814

• 3) Financial leverage on universities. The problem with CIs is not so much the
propaganda they spread but the influence they exert on university administrators,
Salvatore Babone explained.815 Beijing delivers the institutes with the funding, teachers
and their remuneration, the learning material, and sometimes even with the dedicated
buildings. For universities – particularly those with tight budgets – being offered a revenue-generating language center free of charge is hard to refuse. This can create
a dependence, if not a full subjection, that allows Beijing to have an influence on
certain choices of the university, sometimes on the content of some research programs
(to limit the research on Tibet, Taiwan, or China’s influence strategy for instance), on the
choice of guest speakers, and ultimately, on the way the university speaks of China and
of Chinese interests. In all cases, it creates a form of self-censorship.
• 4) Self-Censorship. Experience has shown that the presence of CIs on a campus “compromised their institution’s commitment to academic freedom.”816 There are numerous
documented cases of self-censorship. In 2008, Tel Aviv University decided to close
an exhibition dedicated to the Falun Gong movement at the request of the Chinese
Embassy.817 In 2009, at North Carolina State University, the Chinese director of the CI
warned the university management that the Dalai Lama’s conference scheduled on the
campus could “damage” the relationship of the university with the Hanban, thus forcing the former to cancel the event.818 In 2013, the prestigious University of Sydney also
“cancelled the visit [of the Dalai Lama] to avoid damaging its ties with China, including
funding for its cultural Confucius Institute.”819 In 2014, Xu Lin (许琳), director of the
Hanban, then invited to the annual conference of the European Association of China
studies at the University of Minho in Portugal, demanded that the conference programs
be rid of several pages mentioning Taiwanese institutions, including the Chiang ChingKuo Foundation.820 In December 2018, at Victoria University in Melbourne, the screening of a documentary critical of CIs was cancelled at the last minute under pressure
from the Chinese consulate, and the university lied to the movie promoter, saying there
was no available room. Clive Hamilton highlighted the irony of this situation: “a documentary arguing that the presence of Confucius Institutes gives them political leverage over their hosts was banned because of the political leverage of a

A closed Confucius Institute in Lyon
In France, where there are 18 Confucius Institutes left,822 the fate of Lyon’s Confucius Institute
(CIL) is interesting. Created in 2009 following a proposition of Sun Yat-sen University
(Guangzhou ) to the University Lyon 3, the relationship between the two parties started to
deteriorate in 2012 after the appointment of a new Chinese director: “He questioned our
learning material and insisted that the CIL be more integrated in the university in order to be
included in the core courses. We considered this interference from a structure emanating
from China inappropriate because it was susceptible to compromise our academic
freedom but also the spirit and rules of higher education in the French Republic,”
explained Gregory Lee, professor at the University Lyon 3. He paid the price: “the Hanban director demanded his head and announced the interruption of the annual contribution without
notice. […] Without an agreement, Lee closed the CIL in September 2013.”823

• 5) Effects on the teaching staff. Considering what was previously described, the
implementation of a CI in a university often brings about controversies, and is susceptible to divide the teaching staff, if not marginalize some of the best specialists on China
because they are critical of CIs and, as such, of their colleagues cooperating with the
institute, or receiving its funding. In this situation, Christopher Hughes explains that
“even the most well-established experts in Chinese studies can find themselves
isolated and at odds with their colleagues when they raise concerns. The worstcase scenario is when academics no longer feel able to work in a university that does not
respect their professional standards, suffering from ostracization, exclusion from the
university and denial of promotion [for instance].”824

• 6) Effects on other researchers. Pressure from a CI affects not only immediate colleagues at the university, but it can also extend to the regional or national research and
think tank landscape. For example, in April 2021, the Slovak director of Bratislava’s
CI, Ľuboslav Štora, attempted to intimidate Matej Šimalčík, the director of the Central
European Institute of Asia Studies (CEIAS) and one of the leading China experts in
Central Europe. He sent him a letter attacking him over the publication of a report on
Chinese influence in Slovak universities,825 with explicit threats: “Are you sleeping well?
You should be very stressed when you walk down the street….”826

• 7) Espionage. Jonathan Manthorpe believes that the Confucius program is nothing more than “a major CCP international propaganda and espionage operation
masquerading as a cultural exchange program.”827 It is not only, as Li Changchun, a
member of the Permanent Committee of the Political Bureau, publicly acknowledged,
“an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up;”828 in most cases “they are
espionage outstations for Chinese embassies and consulates through which they
control Chinese students, gather information on perceived enemies, and intimidate dissidents.”829 However, documented cases of espionage are rare, and Western
counter-espionage services do not always have an interest in making them public. Among
the most well-known examples is the case of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) CI
director, Song Xinning, who, in 2019, was expulsed and banned from the Schengen area
for eight years after the Belgian services accused him of espionage – and more specifically, of being a recruiter for Chinese intelligence.830 Following that event, the VUB
decided to close its CI.
The wave of Confucius Institute closures gained momentum in the last few
years and should further spread as a result of the awareness of Chinese influence
strategies, and of the growing tensions between Beijing and Washington. To try to
counter this tendency, the CCP decided to rename the Hanban as the Center for Language
Education and Cooperation in June 2020.831 The announcement by the press agency Xinhua
did not specify that it was an actual change of name, nor did it explain the reasons behind
this change, giving stock to the belief that it might have been a new institution.832 Xu Lin,
likely judged unfit to accompany this change in the image of the institutes, was replaced by
Ma Jianfei, her deputy. The Party also created a non-governmental foundation promoting
teaching Chinese abroad to oversee the institutes. This structure is thus supposed to act as
a buffer between the institutes and the Party.

3. Hanyuqiao: the Chinese Bridge Program
Hanyuqiao (汉语桥), literally “bridge to Chinese” (also translated as “gateway to
Chinese”), and which has been known in English as the Chinese Bridge Program, started
as a linguistic and cultural competition organized by the Hanban with help from the
network of Confucius Institutes. CIs organize the pre-selections in the various countries
where they are implanted and send the best candidates from each country to participate in
the semifinals, followed by the finals, in China. The selected candidates only have to pay for
their roundtrip plane fare while Beijing takes care of the rest – housing and food.833 The
competition is broadcast on the Hunan Television (湖南卫视) channel and is available on
streaming platforms such as Mango TV (芒果TV).834

It targets an audience of non-Chinese young individuals born outside of China
and for whom Chinese is not the mother tongue. Their oral and written comprehension
is assessed with their Chinese speaking abilities and artistic qualities. The winners eventually earn scholarships to study in the PRC.
This competition has two formats: the first, the Chinese Proficiency Competition for
Foreign College Students has been held since 2002 and is open to university students; the
second is the Chinese Proficiency for Foreign Secondary Students, launched in 2008
for high-schoolers. According to numbers provided by the Hanban, around 800,000 university students and 300,000 high-schoolers participated in the preselection stage and 3,000
university students from over 110 countries, along with 2,700 high-schoolers from over 100
countries, were selected to take part to the semifinals and finals in China.835
The objective of these competitions is to spark interest in the Chinese language and
culture among a young foreign public, and to stimulate international exchanges. As attested
by the way the Handan reported on these events, these competitions are an occasion to
“build a ‘circle of friends’ worldwide thanks to Chinese,” but also to “show [one’s] talents
to follow [one’s] Chinese dream” to “tell together ‘[about one’s] affection for China.’”836
The Hanban’s Hanyuqiao has in fact expanded to formats beyond the competitions: the
Chinese Bridge Summer Camp invites foreign high school students for a summer
camp in China during which they can attend language classes but also classes on traditional cultural practices (calligraphy, martial arts, traditional dances, tea ceremonies etc.),
and meet with other youth with an interest in China from all over the world.837 This program also aims to stimulate a passion for learning Chinese and Chinese culture in general,
along with imbuing these teenagers with official Chinese narratives.
Schools and teachers are other targets of the Hanyuqiao. The Chinese Bridge for
Foreign Schools invites the teaching staff who have already established a Chinese program at their schools, or who has the intention of doing so, to spend a week in China, not
only to promote cooperation between the schools, but also to improve their knowledge of
the Chinese education system and promote the learning of Chinese abroad.838 European,
British and American schools are primarily targeted. According to the Hanban’s website, it apparently invites, each year, the teaching staff of 100 primary and secondary schools
from the European Union,839 100 British schools, and, since 2007, it has invited some 450
British delegates in China,840 along with 3,000 American delegates since 2006.841

VII. Think tanks
We have previously shown how the Party attempts to build the image of a powerful
China, with a power that rests, among other things, on the development of the country’s
scientific and technological capacities (→ p. 159). The promotion of that narrative is paired
with important efforts to impose itself in the field of ideas. It is about seducing with
China’s capacity to produce concepts and to raise its voice in international intellectual debates. To do so, the CCP’s strategy is twofold: on the one hand, setting up
branches of Chinese think tanks abroad, whose mission is to showcase the Chinese
intellectual power by inserting themselves in the local intellectual and political debates; on
the other hand, similarly to the United Front’s strategy consisting in using one’s friends
against one’s enemies, the Party-State also tries to get closer to the existing structures
susceptible to assimilate and share Chinese narratives.

Beyond the relays the CCP is susceptible to find in foreign think tanks and foundations,
its strategy in the field of ideas consists in reinforcing the Chinese presence in international debates. To do so, and in accordance to Xi Jinping’s spoken exhortation to the
19th Congress to build “new think tanks with Chinese characteristics,” these institutions
have developed their activities abroad and branches in several target countries, notably in
Europe. They have organized “academic” events with foreign think tanks and universities, and tried to sign cooperation agreements. This strategy allows them to establish a
sense of respectability for Chinese think tanks, of which most are tied to the CCP,842 and
to spread official narratives.
For instance, on October 4 and 5, 2018, the Fudan Institute of Belt and Road
Global Governance (BRGG) participated in an event organized by the Confucius
Institute of the University of Edinburgh on “The Belt & Road Initiative: Challenges and
Opportunities.”843 On this occasion, the Shanghai-based think tank and the Future Institute
of Edinburgh signed a memorandum in order to foster their cooperation and research
on the silk roads. Yet, and even if the BRGG presents itself as a think tank tied to Fudan
University, a bundle of concordant traces reveal close links with the Party. Its objective
is not limited to spreading the Party’s narrative – or, to promote the Silk Roads, as it was
announced by its director at the launch in 2017844 – but its director Jiao Yang (焦扬) is also
the Party’s secretary at Fudan University, after several stints in the propaganda services of
the city of Shanghai.845 In addition, the China Daily affirmed, when the Fudan think tank
was created, that it was financially supported by the China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC
Energy).846 If the Hong Kong-based CEFC describes itself as a non-state think tank dedicated to the promotion of international dialogue, it is a branch of CEFC China Energy
Company Limited, which we mentioned before (→ p. 117). It was founded and headed by

PLA were known because he had been an assistant secretary of the CAIFC, a structure
linked to the PLA’s liaison department.848 In addition, Andrew Chubb highlighted the troubling resemblance between the logos of the CAIFC and the CEFC.849
Chinese think tanks are multiplying cooperation agreements with foreign organizations to
facilitate the circulation of the Party’s narrative. Some go even further and set up branches
abroad, where the objective is to create tighter bonds with the actors of the target country’s
intellectual debates, and thus to be able to influence the content of these debates.

1. CGTN think tank
On December 4, 2019, during the third CGTN Global Media Summit dedicated to
“media and technologies,” Beijing announced the creation of a CGTN think tank. The
event was held in the presence of Shen Haixiong (慎海雄), deputy director of the propaganda department.

The CGTN think tank is presented by its instigators as a media think tank – a new
generation of think tanks that can lean on the enormous information gathering capacities of media outlets like CGTN. The idea is to combine the capabilities of these two
types of structures: the impressive data gathering capacities of the media and the
analyzing skills of think tanks. The Chinese media that reported on the event have
explained that this endeavor was motivated by the difficulty to organize a rational debate
at the international level, along with the weakness of the Chinese voice in the concert of
nations. Beijing’s ambition is thus to create an exchange platform that leaves room for the
promotion of the opinions of Chinese intellectuals and experts, and to ultimately improve
the understanding of China in the world.850
According to Chinese media, the CGTN think tank has already signed about fifty partnerships with foreign think tanks, including the Schiller Institute (→ p. 326). Twenty-seven
institutions were present during the inaugural event on December 4. And several political

Ministers and president of the European Commission), Esko Aho (former Finnish prime
minister), Jenny Shipley (former New-Zealander prime minister), Yves Leterme (former
Belgium prime minister) and Han Seung-soo (former South Korean prime minister).851
Since the launch, the CGTN think tank has not communicated much on its development,
partnerships, or even on its activities; it is then difficult to evaluate its precise place in the field,
and a fortiori, its impact on the international stage, which altogether seems relatively modest.
CGTN’s pseudopod introduced itself on the media’s website as a think tank like any
other, and, to add stock to this statement, it offered a video that explained “what a think
tank is.” However, far from showcasing or presenting Chinese think tanks, this video, produced by a Western communication firm, features Western think tanks. In this way, CGTN
tried to incorporate its think tank in the international think tank community by association,
to benefit from the legitimacy of others.

Overall, CGTN’s think tank seems to be yet another relay susceptible to spread China’s
voice or, in other words, to broadcast CCP narratives we previously identified. The advertisement above of a debate organized on the efficiency of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(→ p. 152) to cure the Covid-19 is but one example. The Chinese think tank also took part
to the campaign that disseminated counter-narratives on the epidemic and highlighted the
efficiency of China’s crisis management. For instance, CGTN organized debates defending
that the virus might not have been from China (→ p. 589).
Strictly-speaking, CGTN’s think tank is thus a networking tool more than an idea-producing institution.

2. Offensive on Central and Eastern Europe (The China-CEE Institute and the
SASS)
China specifically targets Central and Eastern European countries through the
16+1 cooperation format created in 2012,852 and renamed 17+1 with the addition of
Greece in 2019, then again 16+1 with the departure of Lithuania in May 2021. The format
is asymmetrical – not because China is alone in front of 17 other countries, but because it
weights far more than all of its interlocutors combined. Incidentally, it clearly falls within

a logic of “ the strong against the weak,” and the Party-State uses this channel to promote its vision and its initiatives, notably the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It is also
meant to divide Europe since this format brings together European Union members and
countries with a pending (or no) membership (Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro,
and Albania). Diplomatic sources have confirmed that Beijing uses this format to try to
play countries against the EU, amplifying existing fault lines, fueling resentment, such
as when it spreads the idea that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are “less well
treated” than Western European countries. In addition, the Party-State seems to be thinking
about expanding this group to other non-EU countries, to diminish the influence of member states and give added influence to EU critics.

Be that as it may, this regional offensive is not simply economic: it also includes cultural influence, as shown, among other things, by the increased number of Confucius
Institutes (37 in the 17 countries: 6 in Poland, 5 in Hungary, 4 in Romania, 3 in Greece
and Slovakia, 2 in Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Czech Republic and 1 in Slovenia,
Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia)853; the multiplication of programs aimed at the youth (Bridge for the Future; China-CEE Young
Political Leaders Forum) and at the not-so-young (Political Parties Dialogue); the project
of a Fudan University campus in Budapest (see below), and the China-CEE (for Central
and Eastern Europe) Institute, founded in April 2017.

attended by Liu Qibao, director of the Propaganda Department, Wang Weiguang, president
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), and Huang Ping, the executive director
of the China-CEE Institute (see picture above).854
The China-CEE Institute is derived from the CASS. Huang Ping is, in fact, the director of its European Studies Institute, under which authority the China-CEE Institute is.
If it proudly displays its independence with respect to European structures, this is due to
the refusal of the Institute of World Economy of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to
cooperate with the CASS, due to the future think tank’s then-blurry objectives and governance mechanisms.855
The China-CEE conducts two types of activities: organizing conferences and symposiums, with Chinese researchers visiting Europe in particular, and the publication of notes,
reports and books. According to its 2019 annual report, it organized four international
summits, three workshops, and seven conferences, published 10 studies, 8 books and over
800 weekly notes covering the 17 Central and Eastern European countries that year.856
The think tank is, first and foremost, interested in the relations between China and
Central and Eastern European countries, which are systematically presented as
positive and mutually beneficial. In fact, an important part of its work focuses on analyzing these countries. The image of China in Central and Eastern Europe is among
the topics it closely monitors. A study and numerous books have been published on the
topic since 2017: some have dealt with the region in general, others with one country in
particular, or with the general image of China, while others have examined foreign representations on specific topics.857 Unsurprisingly, the think tank played an important role
during the Covid-19 crisis, relaying the Party’s discourse and evaluating its adherence among
European public opinions.
Beyond the diffusion of the Party’s discourse, the China-CEE Institute seemingly plays
another, subtler, role in the CCP’s influence machinery. By gathering around the institute
and its projects an increasing number of local researchers working closely or indirectly on
China, and by forging ties with those countries’ authorities to be present in the heart of
their research systems, the Institute prevents the emergence – or the survival – of independent research on China. In that regard, there is a growingly notable bias in the formulation of questions in some PhD thesis on China. Its considerable financial resources allow
the Chinese think tank to dominate this fragile market. The issue however, does not solely
concerns Central and Eastern Europe as we saw previously (→ p. 286): the entire field, in
Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, needs to ensure the conditions for
independent research on China.
China-CEE is not the first Chinese think tank to be implanted in the West. In
2015, China created the Institute for China-American Studies (ICAS) in Washington.
Inaugurated with great fanfare in the presence of Henry Kissinger, and conceived to spread
China’s voice in Washington’s ecosystem, particularly on maritime issues, the ICAS remains
an insignificant actor whose work is unknown to most American leaders.858 Its presence
on social networks is negligible, it organized less than an event per month in 2019, and it
854. This position is now held by Chen Xin.

publishes very little, despite a propitious period.859 The ICAS’s obvious failure contrasts
with the impact of the China-CEE Institute in Central and Eastern Europe, and
the difference is difficult to explain: lack of support from Chinese authorities? Short-term
ambitions limited to the arbitral court’s decision on the South China Sea in 2016? Lack of
skills and of understanding on the functioning of the U.S. think tank ecosystem? Whatever
the case may be, Europe shows that China now knows how to put in place its narrative strategies through its think tanks. It seems that the implementation of the CASS’s
branch is not meant to be a unique case, and other first-rate think tanks will likely
develop branches abroad in the near future.
Hungary, Europe’s soft underbelly for Beijing
Hungary’s Prime minister since 2010, and champion of “illiberalism,” Viktor Orbán is known
for holding sympathetic positions in the EU toward the “great authoritarians” states, Russia
(he asked for the withdrawal of European sanctions), Turkey and China. Within a decade, he
turned Hungary into the “bridgehead of China in Europe.”860 The first European country to
sign a deal with Beijing as part of the Bridge and Roads Initiative (BRI), Hungary is the prime
destination for Chinese investment in Central and Eastern Europe. Several big Hungarian
companies, such as BorsodChem (the biggest national chemicals producer), were bought by
Chinese companies.861 Beijing initiated several major infrastructure works, including the highspeed railway line between Budapest and Belgrade that, as part of the BRI, aims to shorten
the distance between the Greek port Piraeus, which was also ceded to a Chinese company,
and the center of Europe; and the construction of “the biggest, most modern rail terminal in
Europe,” close to the Ukrainian border, which will welcome all the trains coming from China,
and was branded the “Western gate” of ‘the new silk roads.’”
In Hungary, and contrary to more and more European countries, Huawei can deploy a 5G network. Furthermore, during the Covid-19 epidemic, an “aerial bridge” on which the Hungarian
government heavily communicated, delivered more than 90 million masks and 40 million protection cloths from China; and, in late January 2021, Hungary became the first EU country
to approve a Chinese vaccine (Sinopharm). In September 2021, the Hungarian government
signed a letter of intent with Sinopharm to build an infrastructure for the local production
of the Chinese vaccine within ten months.862 It is also in Budapest that Fudan University will
build the first Chinese campus in Europe, on a gigantic 130-hectare plot – the government
announced it two years after banning the Central European University (CEU), which was
attacked for having been founded and financed by the U.S. billionaire of Hungarian descent
George Soros. He is considered by Orbán as an enemy of the state; And yet, the Court of
Justice of the EU considered this decision contrary to European law.863 The construction could
be contracted to the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), which has
been “suspected of corruption and espionage in many parts of the world in recent years”
(this is the company that bugged the African Union headquarters, for example → p. 130). It
apparently use mostly Chinese labor and materials, at a cost of €1.5 billion – more than the
country spent on its entire higher education system in 2019 – a budget “mainly financed by a
Chinese loan, which Hungary would pay for.”864 This Hungarian branch of Fudan University
should open in 2024 and quickly grow to accommodate 330 teachers, 150 administrative staff
and 5,000 students, including 500 PhD students, by 2028.865

To complement the efforts of the China-CEE Institute, Beijing has more recently launched
a new initiative, this time aimed at Central Europe alone – easier to manage at a time when
its eastern segment, in particular the Baltic countries, have been questioning their relationship
with China. The 17+1 format has been weakened by Lithuania’s departure and calls for others
to follow suit (→ p. 644), and the states of the region are less and less naïve about Beijing’s
ambitions. Hence, Beijing has focused on the Visegrád Group (Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Slovakia) by creating a Research Center for the Visegrád Group within the Shanghai
Academy of Social Sciences (SASS) in January 2021. Headed by Wang Jian (王健), who also
directs the SASS’s Institute of International Relations, the center was notably featured at the
second China-Central and Eastern European Countries Fair in June in Ningbo, Zhejiang.866 The
SASS is a powerful vehicle: founded in 1958, the oldest Chinese think tank in social sciences, it
is one of the best endowed and politically connected academic organizations in China. Some
of its departments also act as cover structures for MSS agents, as the US Department of Justice
detailed in the documents of a case of espionage: “since at least 2014, the FBI has assessed that
Chinese intelligence officers have used SASS affiliation as cover identities.”867

B. The use of local relays
1. Think tanks
The CCP has built a vast network of relationships with think tanks and foundations around the world. These structures cooperate with China to varying degrees and
for a variety of reasons. Some simply organize events with China on an ad hoc basis, while
others have developed relatively extensive collaborative programs that espouse the Chinese
reading of international relations. Some identify a community of interest or ideology with
Beijing, while others are only driven by greed. These partners compensate for the weaknesses of the Chinese presence in international debates.
A special effort has been dedicated to supporting the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI), with dedicated platforms such as the Belt and Road Think Tank Cooperation
Alliance (一带一路智库合作联盟). The Alliance brings together some 50 Chinese
research institutions and its international branch (Belt and Road International Think Tank

Cooperation Alliance, 一带一路国际智库合作联盟) was launched in 2016. Other platforms are the Silk Road Think Tank Network (SiLKS, 丝路国际智库网络) inaugurated at
the Silk Road Forum in Madrid in 2015; Research and Development International (RDI, 蓝
迪国际智库平台); and the Belt and Road Studies Network (BRSN, 一带一路国际智库
合作委员会). Nadège Rolland analyzed these alliances for Sinopsis.868
In the following pages, we distinguish three categories, or degrees, of Chinese influence
through local think tanks, according to criteria that will be detailed: occasional partners,
circumstantial allies, and accomplices. To avoid any misunderstanding, it is important to
add that here, as elsewhere in this report which focuses on how the Party-State designs and
implements its influence operations, these categories are to be understood from Beijing’s
point of view, and not from the point of view of local relays, who generally do not have the
impression of being partners, allies or, even less, accomplices. What we are saying is that this is
how Beijing sees and uses them, whether they are aware of it or not.
We will give examples that are illustrative: they allow us to understand what, in concrete
terms, these relations consist of. In no way do they constitute judgments on the quality of
the institutions and individuals cited, or even on their positions vis-à-vis China: it is not a
question of whether they are “pro-Beijing” – most are not -, only that the partnerships they establish, especially with the Chinese embassy, the events they organize
or in which they participate, the Party magazines in which they publish, or the stories they disseminate, de facto contribute to China’s influence. This is the case even
if they also know how to be critical of Beijing, because one does not cancel out the other.
This is not to say that these think tanks should not have relations with the Chinese
authorities. Dialogue is fundamental: it is important to continue to see and talk to each
other. Other institutions, including IRSEM, and the authors of this report, also receive
Chinese delegations in private, even from the PLA, and carry out missions in China.869 The
difference with the examples given in the following pages is that, in so doing, no resonance
or publicity is given to the Party’s propaganda – and, moreover, the Party-State can be more
freely contradicted, since there is no fear that it will end a partnership.

a. Occasional partners
This first category refers to think tanks, foundations and research centers which, far from
championing the Chinese model, serve as a sounding board on local markets of ideas.
Actors in this category may be directly solicited by Beijing, especially when it is ‘simply’ a
matter of co-organizing events designed by the Party. Other organizations may however
volunteer their services. These partnerships are beneficial to the Party because, with limited
efforts, they expand its contact area and acceptability on foreign land. When a reputable
think tank organizes an event with China, Beijing is looking for that organization’s ability
to get the Party’s message across. Rather than the scientific dimension of the interventions,
it is their compatibility with the Chinese discourse and their ability to be heard by a large
section of the population that appeals to China.
Think tanks in this category generally have a certain credibility on the national or even
international scene, and a pluralistic production. They do not work specifically on China and
they maintain relations with a large number of countries, including the United States and

possibly Taiwan. Besides, some may have had a critical discourse and publicly denounced
Chinese retaliatory measures (ad hominem attacks, lawsuits, sanctions) and censorship when
the Party tried to impose it on them. Thus, they cannot be considered “pro-Chinese,” and
this is precisely what increases their value from Beijing’s point of view.
The example of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS)
The “Paris Forum on the ‘Belt and Road’ Initiative”, co-organized since 2017 by
the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) and the Chinese
Embassy in France, belongs to this category. This event makes a laudatory presentation of
Chinese narratives on the New Silk Roads. Three sessions have so far been held: November 29,
2017, January 10, 2019 and December 19, 2019.870 The forums are systematically introduced
by the Chinese ambassador to France. And, according to an observer, “all criticism
has been carefully stifled,” and the events aim “above all to communicate in order to
appease fears about this enormous plan launched in 2013 by the Chinese president, Xi
Jinping.”871 Commentating on the first edition, the newspaper La Lettre A also believed that
“the conference gave the impression of a lobbying operation in favor of the Chinese project,”
with speakers who, in their large majority, “acted as fervent proponents of a French adhesion
to the Chinese project.”872 Several researchers “have underlined the apparent ‘docility’ of the
speakers at these conferences and questioned a possible influence from Beijing’ on the institute.
Pascal Boniface [IRIS’ director] firmly denied these accusations.”873

During the first forum in 2017, the Chinese embassy handled most of the interventions
on the Chinese side. The participating Chinese think tanks were structures of the state
apparatus. For example, the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS – 中国国际问
题研究所) is the official think tank of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the
China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR – 中国现代国际关系
研究院) is considered a branch of the Ministry of State Security.874 The composition of

874. Although the Chinese regime never mentions this membership, clear links between the two structures can be
identified: a large part of the CICIR staff is trained, and even teaches, at the University of International Studies (国际
关系学院 – often called Guoguan University). However, in 1965, this university was placed under the responsibility of
the Central Investigation Department of the CCP (中共中央调查), which was integrated into the Ministry of State
Security when it was created in 1983 (→ p. 81). See also the Baidu pages (in Chinese) of the university and the DCI:
https://archive.vn/pos0t et https://archive.vn/pWocZ.

316

the forum changed little in subsequent sessions, with most Chinese speakers coming from
Party-State structures and passing its narratives on.
It was also striking to note that specific warnings expressed by speakers about the Chinese
project, notably that it must respect a number of principles, were coined in the very terms
of the debate constructed by the Party. These speakers thus validated the ambitions of the
CCP through the vocabulary it had forged. This observation applied especially to political actors, who are the Chinese authorities’ preferred targets as they are “easier”
to influence than researchers. For instance, at the second session on January 10, 2019,
Christian Cambon, senator of Val-de-Marne and chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs, Defense and the Armed Forces, declared about the BRI: “[we] are starting to realize that this is a much more important ambition [that we previously thought] that aims to
create a new world order based on the development of exchanges which presents many
advantages […] from this point of view, it seems to us that a certain number of specific
points must be respected, notably the win-win principle.”875 The adoption of this Chinese
expression placed the debate in some sort of tautology. China is invited to propose a “winwin” project, which happens to be precisely the Chinese leitmotif. The senator borrowed
additional elements from the Chinese narrative: first, the inevitability of China’s rise to
power, which could only lead to the decision to work with it; second, the representation of
the Silk Roads as a factor of peace in the world. All this illustrates the prevalence of the
vocabulary conveyed by the Chinese Embassy in the French debate.
Another feature of this debate was worth noting: the comparison between the United
States and China; the idea that, since we cooperate with the United States, there is no legitimate reason to refuse to cooperate with China. According to this idea, France should adopt
a kind of “equidistant diplomacy,” as if the country was as far away from China as from
the US. This way of equalizing China and the United States is widespread in France,
without being really explained or justified.
Under these conditions, it is evident that, from the embassy’s point of view, an event
such as the “Paris Forum on the ‘Belt and Road’ Initiative” serves first and foremost to
promote the Silk Roads in France, while leaving the French public with the impression that China is willing to discuss its foreign policy. In this way, such an action helps
reinforce the positive image of China.
These events are not the only ones in which IRIS interacts with the Chinese embassy. As
we will see (→ p. 344), IRIS Director Pascal Boniface and, to a lesser extent, IRIS senior
research fellow Barthélémy Courmont have also participated in events organized by or with
the Chinese Embassy or Party agencies.876 As we shall also see, IRIS maintains ties with the
publishing house La Route de la Soie, founded and directed by Sonia Bressler, which
notably published Maxime Vivas’s polemical book on Uyghurs (→ p. 335). Not only have
Pascal Boniface and IRIS researchers published articles in three of the first eight issues of
the journal Dialogue Chine-France, which La Route de la Soie co-publishes with an organization dependent on the CCP’s Propaganda Department (→ p. 341), but Courmont (IRIS)
is also an author and series editor at La Route de la Soie, and IRIS has published a note

Future co-organized by the Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies (ACCWS) on August 26, 2021

Publishing Group (CIPG), a Party agency under the Propaganda Department (→ p. 321).

by Bressler on “China Bashing” (→ p. 343). IRIS has also published Pierre Picquart,877 a
researcher known for relaying Beijing’s positions. The author of several books, all of them
apologetic,878 Picquart frequently appears in Chinese media (but also in Russian media,
notably RT and Sputnik), to explain, for instance, that “the violence caused by demonstrators in Hong Kong is disturbing and intolerable,” that “never in world history has a country
evolved so favorably than China has in 70 years,” or that “the CCP is leading the Chinese
to achieve remarkable accomplishments.”879 Systematically presented in these media as a
“doctor in geopolitics and human geography from the University Paris VIII” as if to better
make him play the role of a scientific guarantee, his positions are relayed by the Chinese
embassy (→ p. 234), and he has participated in events organized by it.880
Despite all this, it is important to note that IRIS also sometimes publishes less Chinafriendly notes. The structure seems to maintain a relative pluralism, and both Boniface and
Courmont know how to be critical of Beijing as well. For example, Boniface publicly defended
Valérie Niquet when she announced that she was being sued for defamation by Huawei in
November 2019 (→ p. 53),881 and Antoine Bondaz when he was attacked by the Chinese
embassy in March 2021882 – which, according to Libération, may have led IRIS to reevaluate its
relationship with the embassy (→ p. 239). In other words, while their occasional relationship
with Chinese authorities, such as sometimes giving the floor to Party relays, or participating
in CCP-driven publications or events, de facto contributes to Chinese influence operations
in France – which justifies the presence of this example in this report – there is no indication that this is a conscious effort. Unlike other actors described in the following pages,
there is no defense of the Chinese model here. This is why, in the gradation of influence
through think tanks that we have established, this is only its first degree.
The example of The Bridge Tank (France)
The French think tank The Bridge Tank falls into the same category of occasional
partners. This association, created in 2013 by the economist Joël Ruet and, since then,
chaired by him, presents itself as “an innovative exchange tool, present in major global
forums, active with innovative companies, mobilized by decision-makers.”883 It also devotes
a significant part of its efforts to China: “China, in particular, is a country with which The
Bridge Tank has established working relationships at several levels,”884 explains Ruet, who

was once a visiting researcher at the Center for China in the World Economy at Qinghua
University in Beijing.885
One of the Bridge Tank’s policy board members is Kang Rongping (康荣平), a
researcher at the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (中国社会科学院世界经济与政治研究所研究员) and at the Center for
China and Globalization (whose president is a DTFU advisor → p. 40). And the Bridge
Tank’s China associate director is Zhao Wei (赵巍), an associate professor at ESSCA
School of Management in Angers as well as a member of the Institute for the Reform and
Development of the Pearl River Delta at Sun Yat-sen University (中山大学珠三角改革发
展研究院). The team has other China experts, including Wang Xieshu, a researcher specializing in financial issues, or Zhang Yang, who works on cooperation between China, Europe
and Africa in addition to her position as a partner in the consulting firm Cibola partners
(where Joël Ruet is a member of the advisory committee). It should be noted, however,
that the governance of the Bridge Tank’s actions with Chinese organizations is not only
the responsibility of its president and the Chinese members of its team, but also of other
French personalities and experts on its Board.886
The Bridge Tank partners with the Boao Forum, the “Chinese Davos,” which Joël
Ruet has attended every year since 2018, alongside Jean-Pierre Raffarin and many French
economic leaders. It should be noted that this forum, founded in 1998, chaired by former
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and with an international council that includes former
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda and former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson,
is a rare place that still provides participants with some leeway with respect to Chinese
propaganda.887 Ruet also regularly intervenes in the French and Chinese press, for example in Le Monde in 2018, to describe China as having a “Promethean capacity,” and to
highlight the “historical opportunity to capitalize on the existing Franco-Chinese industrial
relationship, and its extension” to create “one of the driving forces of the post-American
world”888; or in La Chine au présent in 2020, to suggest reading President Xi Jinping’s China’s
Governance.889 The Twitter account of the Chinese embassy has relayed his positions (image
below). He also attended (as well as representatives of several other French think tanks not
mentioned in this report) the launching ceremony of the English and French editions of
another book by Xi Jinping, The Belt and Road Initiative, in April 2019 in Beijing, during the
second Silk Roads Summit, during which The Bridge Tank supported greening this initiative, which emits CO2.890

Tank, also spoke on “the recommended ‘green’ recovery to put the fight against global warming at the heart of global
governance” (clarification provided by The Bridge Tank in a September 24, 2021 correspondence with the authors).

On the left, Joël Ruet with Li Baodong (李保东), vice minister of foreign affairs of the PRC (in charge of international
organizations and conferences, international economic affairs and arms control) and secretary general of the Boao Forum, in May
2018.891 In the middle, Joël Ruet is a regular contributor to Chinese state media (here China Daily in April 2020892) but also Russian
media (RT France and Sputnik). On the right, the embassy publishes on Twitter a video of Joël Ruet produced by CGTN.

The Bridge Tank co-organizes events with the Chinese Embassy in France, such
as the “Forum for the Post-COVID-19 EU-China Cooperation” held on October 15, 2020
or the “Forum on China-EU Cooperation in the New Context” on January 21, 2021. The
later was attended by Jean-Pierre Raffarin while Ambassador Lu Shaye opened the proceedings by thanking his “friends” “for [their] support for the Chinese Embassy in France
and [himself].”893 On October 11, 2019, at the opening of a “high-level seminar on China
and Sino-French relations,” also co-organized by The Bridge Tank, Ambassador Lu Shaye
already “ thank[ed] the Bridge Tank here for the high quality of its work.”894 In its dealings with the embassy, The Bridge Tank mobilizes many French personalities, including
at least three former prime ministers, six former ministers, five former ambassadors and
about thirty experts, practitioners or general officers. Events are generally co-funded, which
explains why The Bridge Tank receives donations from the Chinese Embassy (€40,000
in 2019) and Chinese companies (€34,947.50 from the publishing company Bosheng
International in 2019).895 This transparency is acknowledged and appreciable: unlike other
think tanks mentioned in this report, The Bridge Tank publishes detailed financial statements. Moreover, the association specifies that, in total, its financial commitments on China
“clearly exceed the subsidies received and are made up for by donations from [its] members
or European companies.896

the context in which this seminar was taking place, reducing it to a “high-level seminar on the 70th anniversary of the
People’s Republic of China” (see next note) – even though it was also the “40 years of economic reforms” and the 55th

The Bridge Tank also collaborates with the Academy of Contemporary China and
World Studies (ACCWS) of the China International Publishing Group (CIPG), a
Party agency supervised by the Propaganda Department.899 The ACCWS was founded
in 2004 as the Foreign Communication Research Center of the Foreign Language Bureau of
China. Its website details a team of about 100 permanent researchers working on issues of
communication, Chinese storytelling and world public opinion.900 It also deals with various
instruments of influence, such as the Global Young Leaders Dialogue,901 a program that
invites to China potential future leaders (Joël Ruet is a member of its international steering
committee902). On March 8, 2021, The Bridge Tank sponsored a “Think Tank & Media
Forum on Global Economic Development” with, among others, Jean-Pierre Raffarin’s FPI
and the CIPG of the Chinese Communist Party.903 On May 7, The Bridge Tank and the
ACCWS co-hosted a webinar on “Collaboration between France and China in the PostCovid Era,” again with Jean-Pierre Raffarin.904 On June 16, 2021, The Bridge Tank signed
a memorandum of understanding with the ACCWS, in the framework of a grouping of
think tank (named the “Contemporary China and World” Joint Research Centers905). The
vice-president of CIPG, Gao Anming, attended the ceremony.
The Bridge Tank works directly with the CIPG, whose delegation it hosted in Paris
in 2019.906 On October 21-22, 2019, the two organizations organized with the Information
Office of the State Council of China a “Sino-French Dialogue on Civilizations” in Paris,
with the participation of the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, the President of the
French Constitutional Council and former Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, and former

Finally, among the other Chinese actors with whom the Bridge Tank interacts, we should
mention:
- the Western Returned Scholars Association (WRSA), which is linked to the DTFU
(→ p. 40) and which Joël Ruet met in September 2018 in Xi’an on the sidelines of the
delegation to the 3rd Franco-Chinese Cultural Forum co-organized by WRSA and the
Fondation Prospective et Innovation (FPI → p. 323);910
- the CGTN Think Tank (→ p. 309), which a biography of Joël Ruet actually states
that he “co-launched.”911 Among other projects, the two organizations co-organized the
“Forum on the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals” on September 17-18, 2020912;
- the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS), the official think tank of the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with which the Bridge Tank co-organized an online
conference (“France-China Cooperation: Identifying Common Values and Visions for
Shared Action”) on August 29, 2021,913 with the participation of two former Chinese
and two former French ambassadors. Yu Jiang, the vice president of CIIS, also attended.
He is a French-speaking Chinese diplomat, French National School of Administration
(ENA) alumnus, former political counselor at the Chinese Embassy in France, and, since
2020, he has also been deputy secretary-general of the Xi Jinping Diplomatic Thought
Research Center (习近平外交思想研究中心), set up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and affiliated to the CIIS.914
While these interactions make The Bridge Tank an occasional partner of Chinese authorities, it is important to note that this think tank does not defend the Chinese model, nor
does it disseminate Party narratives. As its name indicates, it acts rather as a “bridge.” For

example, it organized, during the summer of 2021, a meeting between the presidents of the
two liberal and socialist internationals with the objective of seeking coordination in the face
of the rise of illiberalism and other anti-democratic fronts.915 And a bridge can be used in
both directions: in this case, The Bridge Tank uses the multiple channels it maintains with
Chinese authorities to defend French positions, particularly in the fight against global
warming and for the preservation of biodiversity, a subject it has frequently addressed since
the COP21. During a January 21, 2021 seminar co-organized with the embassy, for instance,
several French speakers mentioned France’s strategic interests and pointed out certain shortcomings in the draft comprehensive agreement between the EU and China on investments.

b. Circumstantial allies
Actors in this category not only collaborate occasionally with the Chinese Embassy and/
or Party agencies but, without sharing the CCP’s ideology or even its strategic objectives, they
believe that it is in their interest – of whatever nature they may be – to spread the Party’s
narratives on a regular basis. Their motivations are diverse: for some, it may be anti-Americanism, which means opposing American power rather than adhering to Chinese values; for
others, it may be opportunism, as China can help struggling institutions increase their influence or help them reinvent themselves. In any case, these institutions often act as spokespersons for China by providing an effective vehicle for Beijing’s discursive strategies. In doing so,
they too participate in building a positive image of China’s power.
The fact that these think tanks are pluralistic, sometimes formulating criticisms of the
Party-State, and working on other subjects, including the United States and Europe, does not
change anything, since they nonetheless reproduce Chinese narratives. From Beijing’s point
of view, this dissemination is even more efficient when it is diluted in a pluralistic
whole, since the transmitter will be less suspected of playing into China’s hands.
The example of the French Prospective and Innovation Foundation (FPI)
In France, the Fondation Prospective et Innovation (FPI) illustrates this second category. Created in 1989 by François Dalle and René Monory, who was then a president
of the Vienne General Council, minister of the Economy and president of the Senate,
it initially ambitioned to create a discussion about “continuities inherited from the past”
and the “factors of the future.” It was symbolically established at Poitiers’ Futuroscope
(imagined by René Monory). Today, Jean-Pierre Raffarin (a former prime minister) leads
the foundation. Since 2006, however, it moved from its original objectives to focus on
three main areas916: understanding and appreciating rising new powers, such as China or
Africa; stimulating competitiveness by enlightening and supporting companies, especially
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and intermediate-sized enterprises (ISEs); and
participating in the design of a new global, national, and local governance.
Over the past decade, China has clearly become the preferred theme of the foundation.
At least half the publications and the majority of its activities have dealt with China,
with continued growth over the period that could indicate that the foundation prefers,
when it comes to China, organizing events rather than publishing documents – perhaps

because it is a more appropriate vehicle to influence the political elite.917 The real number
is probably even higher because some publications and activities officially dedicated to current affairs were in fact almost exclusively about China, and usually at its advantage. This
was notably the case of the forum organized by the FPI at the Futuroscope on August 27,
2021. Behind a neutral title (“Les vertiges du monde. Retrouver l’équilibre” [The Vertigo
of the World. Finding a Balance Again]), it was indeed devoted to the relations to Beijing.918
Among the speakers, and in addition to Jean-Pierre Raffarin, were Pascal Boniface, director
of IRIS (→ p. 316);919 Kishore Mahbubani, one of the main pro-Chinese intellectuals on the
international scene and in the Singaporean debate (→ p. 515) – the interrogative title of his
latest book (Has China Won?) has interestingly been translated by an affirmation in French
(Le jour où la Chine va gagner [The Day China Wins]920) – or André Chieng, the vice-president
of the Comité France-Chine, a group of French companies with interests in China that Xi
Jinping personally thanked for having “played an active role in Franco-Chinese economic
exchanges. [The Committee] has contributed a lot to the economy of our two countries.”921
The figures are revealing, but the content of the publications and interventions of
FPI members is even clearer in setting the institution’s role in incorporating and propagating many narratives constructed by the Party:
• On China as the savior of an international order sabotaged by the United States:
“At a time when the United States paralyzed the WTO by refusing to renew the members
of the Dispute Settlement Body, after it dealt a major blow to the Paris Climate agreements, after it refused to redistribute voting rights at the IMF, after it killed the Iranian
nuclear agreement, it is essential to encourage China to participate actively in defining
and adapting the international order.”922
• On a “win-win” China as an opportunity for France: “China is adept of ‘win-win’
solutions. It is constantly striving to develop formulas where each of the stakeholders
can benefit from their engagement. For the French, who are used to a highly organized
market, being forced to adapt to a constantly changing market is a great opportunity.”923
• On the “community of common destiny” dear to Xi Jinping (which is nothing
more than a project of Sinicization of the international system): “In recent times we
have been able to measure the importance of China’s choices, notably through concrete
support for the euro, during our debt crisis, or on the occasion of the Paris Climate
agreements. We can also recall China’s positive attitudes toward international organiza-

917. In January 2021, the IPF website listed 26 publications (since October 2011) out of 52 on China, compared to only
10 on foresight and innovation, 7 on Africa and the Middle East, 5 on European democracy and multilateralism, 2 on the state
of the world, and 2 on culture and religion; as well as 98 events (since April 2008) out of 177 (https://archive.vn/OfAJv).
Since then, the site has been redesigned, with new headings and a different distribution, but you can see on the books page, for
example, that about half of them are about China (https://prospective-innovation.org/publications/livres/).

Le Jour où la China va gagner. La fin de la suprématie américaine, Paris, Saint Simon, 2021. Note that the subtitle is also more
affirmative, since it moves from a “challenge” to American supremacy to its outright “end.”

tions such as the UN and UNESCO. “A Community of common destiny for mankind”
can bring people together.”924
• On the United States as a more significant threat than China: “one can well
imagine that once the compromise with China has been found and finalized, it will be
Europe’s turn. One can wonder what interest Europe can still find in being an ally of the
United States. There is talk of a Chinese threat, but it is a potential one: America’s threat
is present. Between the two, Europe must seek independence and balance.”925
• On Chinese companies as a counterbalance to U.S. companies: “Currently, the
GAFAs (Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon) dominate the world, and the only
ones that can balance them are the BATXs (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi). The
GAFAs operate without counterweight on French territory: neither France nor Europe
has anything to oppose to them. The BATXs weight a lot on the Chinese market but not
on the international market: there is something to be negotiated there.”926
• On the BRI as the vector of a new era from which Europeans would be wrong
to remain on the sidelines: “[China’s] Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is charting a path
for this global synergy from which China intends to create a new global era in the future.
China is astonished and deplores that Europeans are so reluctant to commit themselves
to the BRI but it no longer waits for them. From now on, China is moving forward. We
are wrong to remain petrified in the face of the [the BRI]. For it is good news.”927
• On the diversity of political regimes, which are different but respectable: “Our systems are different and not meant to be similar”;928 “We need a delicate discourse to defend
our interests precisely, but without attacking others. We must acknowledge Xi Jinping’s
unambiguous statement: his country wants to be socialist with Chinese characteristics. We
need to respect his opinion while making clear that we do not share this approach.”929
• On Xi Jinping as a Gaullist figure whose vocation is to bring the country to the
place it deserves: “Often misinterpreted by Western media as a Stalin-like return to
personal power, he has in fact a Gaullist character: The proof of this is publicly given by
the formation of a very high-quality management team and the elevation of the status
of the new helmsman by one rank.”930
• On power put at the service of peace: “China is introducting itself as a peaceful
power, aspiring to more regulated and profitable exchanges based on mutual respect.”931
• On the fact that opposing China’s legitimate expansion would be both vain and
childish: “In the face of the rising tide, only kids can build sand dams. Faced with this
China, which, as we can see, has profoundly and impressively renewed itself, pretending
to stand in the way of its ambitions is illusory and counterproductive; they are, after all,
perfectly legitimate.”932

These examples show how the FPI reproduces Chinese narratives. It reveals that it is in
the Party’s interest to carry out this type of narrative strategies relying on local relays capable of acting as sounding boards.

c. The accomplices
A third category involves think tanks and foundations that share a common vision
of the world with the CCP and whose interests are mainly convergent. That makes
them collaborate with the Chinese authorities and relay their stories but also defend China’s
image in all circumstances.
The example of the International Schiller Institute
The Schiller Institute illustrates this third category. It was founded in 1984 by Helga
Zepp-LaRouche,933 who wished to give substance to the ideas of Friedrich von Schiller, a
18th-century poet, playwright and art theorist. These ideas were delineated during the Third
International Conference that the Institute organized on November 24 and 25, 1984, in
Washington, and which led to the “Declaration of the Inalienable Rights of Man.” This
charter was meant to denounce the excesses of supranational financial institutions and the
“tyranny” that they inflict on less developed countries.934 The Schiller Institute wished to
bring about a new world in which “war, poverty and the wounds that affect us will appear as
the relics of an outdated world.”935 While promoting peace through economic development
and respect for the sovereignty of nations, the Schiller Institute has also been active in the
dialogue of cultures and insisted on a better understanding of the “advantage of others,” a
concept that Jacques Cheminade described as inspired by the Peace of Westphalia (1648).936
The Schiller Institute has developed its activities in many countries. Five seem to receive
special attention, with sister structures working under the umbrella of the International
Schiller Institute: Germany (Schiller-Institut, Vereinigung für Staatskunst e. V.), the United
States (Schiller Institute Inc.), France (Institut Schiller), Denmark (Schiller Instituttet) and
Sweden (Schiller Institutet → p. 536).937 The French website mentions a ‘presence’ in more
than 30 countries, although the exact nature of this presence is not specified.
One of the Institute’s main projects is based on the idea of a “Eurasian Landbridge”938
that would link the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean via three major communication
corridors: a northern route via the Trans-Siberian Railway, a central route through Ukraine,
Russia, Kazakhstan and China, and a southern route via Turkey, Iran and Central Asia to
China. These routes were imagined as a way to bring an end to age-old conflicts through
broadly beneficial Euro-Asian cooperation and economic development.939 Through this
project, LaRouche aspired to a fairer global economic order that would replace failing
933. She was Lyndon LaRouche’s wife.

financial systems. Since the project’s inception during the 1990s, and the appearance of the
Chinese project in 2013, the Eurasian Landbridge concept has expanded to include new
economic and maritime routes.
Since 2013, there has been a gradual convergence between LaRouche and the
Schiller Institute’s ideas on the one hand and the Chinese objectives on the other.
In an interview for Xinhua, Helga Zepp-LaRouche’s husband, Lyndon LaRouche, stated
that China was a key nation in the advent of a new world economic order.940 Not long
afterwards, Helga Zepp-LaRouche published a paper called “New Economic Order Begins
with New Silk Road.” Therein she invited the UN to cooperate and stressed the role that
Xi Jinping’s New Silk Road project could play in the organization of a new world order
capable of taking into account ‘non-aligned’ countries.
As a result of the LaRouches’ positions, the head of the Schiller Institute became a
favorite with Chinese media. For instance, she was invited to Yan Rui’s famous TV how
“Dialogue” on China’s national CCTV channel, which introduced her the “New Silk Road
Lady” and a founder of the “Eurasian Landbridge” project.941 Mrs. Zepp-LaRouche was
also interviewed on China Radio International’s “People in the Know” program. During
the interview, she asserted that the New Silk Road could pave the way for a new credit system between sovereign nations to replace our “unjust financial system.”942

In September 2014, Helga Zepp-LaRouche participated in several conferences on the
Silk Roads in China. At an event organized by China Investment Magazine (中国投资),943
Helga Zepp-LaRouche was introduced by Colonel Bao Shixiu (鲍世修), a former professor at the PLA Academy of Military Science (中国军事科学院), translator of Russian and
specialist in military theory.944 In fact, Bao Shixiu had previously participated in a conference
for the 30th anniversary of the Schiller Institute in June 2014, during which he delivered a
speech describing Obama’s “pivot” policy as an atttempted hegemonic strategy in Asia. He

therefore advocated for an American withdrawal from Asia by adopting Xi Jinping’s leitmotif, detailed at the founding of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building
Measures in Asia (CICA): “security problems in Asia should be solved by Asians themselves. Outsiders should consciously exit the game.”945
Gradually, the common positions turned into a
common strategy. Both Mrs. Zepp-LaRouche’s statements in Chinese media and the participation of Chinese
intellectuals in events organized by the Schiller Institute
have gradually built a positive image of China. They
have given way to an increased coordination between
the two actors and an unremitting support of the
Schiller Institute to China’s influence operations.
This coordination crystallized on December 4, 2019
when CGTN announced the creation of CGTN Think
Tank, a network of foreign think tanks and institutions
the Schiller Institute immediately joined (→ p. 309).946
According to Zheng Bijian (郑必坚),947 president of
the China Institute for Innovation and Development
Strategy (中国科学院国家创新与发展战略研究会), CGTN Think Tank could “play an
outstanding role in the process of deepening and expanding the ‘understanding of China and
the world.’”948 At this event, Helga Zepp-LaRouche addressed the first panel of experts as a
founding member of the project. She stressed the need to extend the Eurasian Landbridge
concept worldwide (World Landbridge), which would make it possible to replace outdated
institutions such as NATO.949
The day after the summit, Zepp-LaRouche was invited on China Radio International’s
“World Today” program. She asserted that the model of Chinese development for eradicating poverty created a new paradigm that contrasted with the Western neo-liberal model,
which was doomed to fail.950
The positions adopted by the Schiller Institute and its president, on social networks and
in their publications, illustrate the converging strategies and the unfailing support given by
the think tank to the dissemination of the Party’s narratives. All the Institute’s publications
have unfailingly praised the projects included in the Silk Roads. To this end, the Institute
does not hesitate to appropriate the Party’s narratives. The Schiller Institute’s publication
The New Silk Road becomes the World Landbridge: A Shared future for humanity illustrates this by
taking up the slogan of the community of common destiny.951

Each national branch of the Schiller Institute targets local officials to convince
them to join the Chinese project. Thus, following Rome’s decision to join the Silk Roads
project, the Schiller Institute urged France to do the same.

Mrs. Zepp-LaRouche is also committed to defending China against its Western
critics. This posture was evident during the Covid-19 crisis, which led Zepp-LaRouche
to cross swords with China’s critics.952 Her criticisms were notably aimed at the United
Kingdom, presented as the cornerstone of the opposition to China. Zepp-LaRouche
described London as resisting dialogue with China and set a somewhat fallacious historical
continuity between the Opium Wars and Covid-19.

Think tanks such as the Schiller Institute are therefore essential nodes in the export
and dissemination of Chinese narratives, which aim above all to build a positive image
of China. Additionally, as per the examples above, they can also act as intermediaries exerting a certain pressure on Beijing’s critics. In this case, with the Schiller Institute, Beijing
can count on the entire LaRouche movement, which has many branches around the
world. In Australia, for example, the Australian Citizens Party, a political party affiliated with
the LaRouche movement, regularly attacks CCP critics – to the delight of Chinese authorities and media.954 Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian praised those “very well-written
articles,” a comment echoed by the Chinese embassy in Australia.955
These relays can also provide a “scientific” legitimacy (even though their work is precisely not scientific). For example, when a large number of researchers around the world

2. Publishers
Chinese narratives, such as the representation of China as a benevolent power, are not
solely supported by think tanks and foundations but also by actors in the publishing industry. In France, the La Route de la Soie publishing house is an interesting case of relatively advanced cooperation with China.

a. The example of La Route de la Soie – Editions (The Silk Road Editions, France)
The publishing house La Route de la Soie was created in 2017 by Sonia Bressler,
a former journalist who holds a PhD in philosophy and has created a communication and
strategy consulting firm (Bressler Conseil956). She justified her decision to open a publishing
house by the partiality of the publishing sector in France, which presumably systematically rejects Chinese or Iranian manuscripts.957 She also expressed her admiration for “Xi
Jingping’s (sic) project One Belt One Road, that I find absolutely gigantic, and which is economical, structured and, to my mind, represents an axis that should be developed to pacify
the world”958 – hence the name she gave to the company.
Sonia Bressler visited China for the first time in 2005, arriving in train from Moscow
and she ultimately visited the country six times between 2005 and 2019; it allowed her to
“see the progress made in the social development of China,” according to Xinhua, in one
of her many interviews with the Chinese press agency.959 Between March 2015, when she
said that Xi Jinping’s book The Governance of China “[marked] a milestone for the country
and the Communist Party of China (CPC),”960 and March 2021, she was quoted by Xinhua
in no less than 55 articles written in French and English,961 all introducing her as a “French

interviews, she adopts the Party’s talking points:
- On the overall role of China in the world: “China has a good system… China should
be proud of itself ”963; “[according] to me, China is opening the eyes of the world […] It is
a motor, a force that tends to link cultures and civilizations together according to a “winwin” exchange;”964 “[the] Sino-French friendship is the key to the pacification of the world
and to the creation of a new system of thoughts and for the realization of humanity”;965
“the Chinese civilization is the oldest on the planet and, saying that, we should understand
that we have everything to learn from it”;966 “China does not look for hegemony, [it] has
decided to share and not to dominate”;967 “we ought to draw inspiration from what China
has implemented, for instance education designed for people in poverty, creative social welfare mechanisms, local and national joint development plans, and so on”;968 and she said that
Xi Jinping’s opening speech at the 73rd World Health Assembly, in May 2020, confirmed
“that China is open to the world and the idea of a shared collective responsibility”;969
- On Tibet, which she visited three times between 2007 and 2016, and on which she
published four books:970 “[without] the help of the Chinese government, it would be very
difficult to preserve the Tibetan culture”;971 “[the] improving living conditions led to an
expansion of the life span, education put an end to illiteracy […] I discovered that 5G had
been set up in Lhasa. In France, we do not even have it yet”;972 “I was able to see the incredible transformation of Lhasa, between traditions and absolute modernity”;973 and so on;
- And on Xinjiang, which she also visited several times and on which she wrote three
books974: “I saw people’s life [in Xinjiang] was getting better and better. I believe it will

This corpus is completed by her blog, on which she also systematically defends
Beijing’s positions and promotes Chinese achievements, from the “14th Chinese five-year
plan”978 to the Belt and Road Initiative (“which will simply “pacify the world” and invent “a
new system of values”),979 but also Hong Kong (“a symbol of the ending undivided Western
domination”)980 and Paris (while returning the favor to Xinhua: “[not] far from Matignon, at
85 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, you can find the Xinhua Gallery, a beautiful space where
you can discover exhibitions on China and its history all year long”).981 Besides, she insists
on the superiority of the Chinese model (“China represents the oldest civilization. It has
seen everything, experienced everything, and invented a thousand techniques (that we stole
afterward) … and today, we fail to draw lessons from China […] as usual, China listens, tries
to integrate [ideas] while Westerners try to impose their thinking and their rhythm. On the
one side China embraces, while the West orientates, closes, segments [on the other]”) before
inviting her readers to “leave modernity by re-formatting the Enlightenments.”982

Embassy of China.988
The president of Guang Hua Media, editor-in-chief of the Nouvelles d’Europe and Le 9, is
Zhang Xiaobei (张晓贝),989 who also manages the Horizon Oriental publishing house990
that published one of Sonia Bressler’s books on Tibet (she also penned a chapter in a collective book he edited on 50 years of friendship France – China).991 The Les Amis de Nouvelles
d’Europe [Friends of Nouvelles d’Europe] association, created in 1992, opened a cultural
center in Gentilly in 2013 as well, and it then congratulated itself on being “the first
Confucius Classroom opened in France, and recognized by the Hanban”992 (→ p. 299).

On March 1, 2015, Qiu Yuanping (裘援平), head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, a structure subordinate to the UFWD
(→ p. 66), visited the Nouvelles d’Europe Cultural Center and its Confucius Classroom, accompanied by Zhang Xiaobei,
president of Guang Hua Media and the newspaper Nouvelles d’Europe, Zhong Cheng, executive vice-president of the newspaper,
Chen Xiaoyan, its vice-president, and Liang Yang, its editor-in-chief.993

This was the context during which Sonia Bressler opened her publishing house, La
Route de la Soie, in 2017. Her own books, on Tibet and Xinjiang, give an apolitical,
uncluttered, almost unreal vision of it compared to the tragic situation in these regions.

book intended to shed light on the situation in Xinjiang. Maxime Vivas stated bluntly that
“the fable of the Uyghur ‘genocide’” was fabricated by the CIA using “fake photos” and
“false testimonies.” According to him, the reality is quite different since the autonomous
province “is pulling itself out of its backwardness and poverty with the help of the whole
of China.”994

Contrary to the impression that the French-speaking public discovered the author with
this controversial book, Maxime Vivas is not an unknown actor of Chinese influence in
France. Born in 1942, this former postal worker and ergonomist is resolutely positioned
on the left of the French political spectrum: a former CGT trade unionist,995 still host for
a militant radio created by the CGT996; the former literary referent at ATTAC (an alterglobalization organization);997 he is a “long-time personal friend” of Jean-Luc Mélenchon,
leader of the political party La France Insoumise, whom he publicly supported in previous
elections and who prefaced two of his books.998 Vivas has been an administrator of the
website of “alternative news” Le Grand Soir,999 which “for many years has made itself
known with readily conspiratorial content, emanating either from its own editorial staff or
from notoriously conspiratorial friendly websites such as Réseau Voltaire, Mondialisation.
ca [→ p. 602] or ReOpen911.info.”1000 Vivas is also a regular contributor to the Russian
channel RT France, which invites him to speak on various topics, including Venezuela (as
he does not hide his sympathy for the Bolivarian revolution) and China.

Maxime Vivas with the “red shirts” in a demonstration in Caracas, June 2, 2007 (image published by Jean-Luc Mélenchon on
his blog1001). Vivas is the author of a novel titled Rouges Les Collines de Caracas (Arcane, 2015) which he notably presented and
autographed at the stand of the Bolivarian Alliance at the “Fête de l’Huma” in September 2015.1002

Vivas has defended Beijing since the late 2000s by going after its adversaries: first, at
the end of 2007, in a book attacking RSF (La face cachée de Reporters sans frontières: de la CIA
aux faucons du Pentagone),1003 precisely when the NGO was campaigning to denounce human
rights violations in China ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.1004 When the media spoke
about it in 2008, the author was “on vacation in China.”1005
In 2010, he travelled to Tibet, in a trip admittedly “organized by the Chinese authorities. ‘We
could even say ‘supervised’”; he reported on it in an article untitled “Choses vues au Tibet,”1006
a daring reference to Victor Hugo. The following year, he published a book attacking the Dalai
Lama (Pas si zen: la face cachée du dalaï-lama),1007 which was abundantly relayed by Chinese media,
including some presenting Vivas as a “researcher on Tibet”.1008 Then, in 2015, in an interview
with Xinhua, he revealed that he had finished “a new book on China in which I examine the
issue of laicity in Tibet.” The book was untitled Tibet: Quelques vérités à ne pas dire aux libres censeurs,
aux nostalgiques de la théocratie safran et aux ennemis de la laïcité, and he hoped “first to publish it […] in
China. He wanted, as he explained, to show Chinese readers that they have friends in France.”1009
That said, the book was neither published, in France or in China.
Then, he turned to the Uyghur issue, by travelling to Xinjiang twice, in 2016 and
2018, during trips organized by the Chinese authorities. The second time, he was invited
by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (新疆生产建设兵团, also called

Bingtuan),1010 “a paramilitary organization subordinate to the CCP […] and directly involved
in the implementation of a complete program of surveillance, detention, and indoctrination in Xinjiang, which target the Uyghurs, and members of other ethnic minorities.” The
organization’s first secretary was sanctioned by U.S. authorities in July 2020 for his role in
“grave human rights violations.”1011 These supervised trips provided the content of the
book published by La Route de la Soie. From the perspective of Chinese authorities, and
of their trolls on social networks, they provided the author with his legitimacy – because he
went to see it “there for himself.”
Once his manuscript was completed, Vivas submitted it to nine “leftist” publishing
houses, to no avail. He then turned to Sonia Bressler, who “accepted it even before
reading it.”1012 By August 2020, and even though the book had yet to be published,
Maxime Vivas’ remarks on Uyghurs were already relayed by the Chinese embassy
in France, which later promoted the book upon its release, as did Chinese state media and
other Chinese diplomatic social media accounts (see images below). The Minister of Foreign
Affairs Wang Yi himself promoted the book during a press conference, noting that Vivas
“[based] on his two trips to the autonomous region, […] tells a real Xinjiang that enjoys
prosperity and stability.”1013 The Ministry’s spokesperson also “[gave] him a thumbs-up for
his courage to reveal the truth and hope[d] more people will cheer him on”1014. Despite this
Chinese media hype, four months after its release only a few hundred copies of the books
had been sold in France.1015 From Beijing’s point of view, this is not an underperformance
however, since it is propaganda for inernal use: in promoting Vivas’ book, the objective is
not to convince the French but to show, in China, that the Party-State has support abroad.

the Beijing International Book Fair with a “Special Book Award of China,” the highest
award for foreign authors, translators and publishers. His “great friend, the journalist Zheng
Ruolin”1016 (→ p. 628) represented him at a ceremony presented by Huang Kunming (黄
坤明), director of the Propaganda Department and member of the CCP Political Bureau
(→ p. 64).1017 These awards, created in 2005 by the General Administration of Press,
Publishing, Broadcasting, Film and Television (→ p. 193), recognize individuals “who have
made significant contributions to the promotion of Chinese culture abroad.”1018 The winners receive 50,000 yuan (€6,700) each.1019

Maxime Vivas has since co-edited a collective book, La Chine sans œillères (China without blinkers), published by a communist1023 (or “Marxist” according to the Chinese embassy)
publishing house that had been hosted by the Chinese ambassador to France. The latter
is also promoting it on social networks. Both Vivas and Beijing have a vested interest in
diversifying their vectors and therefore in working with other publishing houses. Finally,
Vivas is also promoting the Chinese vaccine on social networks (below).

When Maxime Vivas attacks the IRSEM
Reacting to an article in Le Monde announcing the imminent publication of this report and
mentioning him, Maxime Vivas published an article on his website Le Grand Soir entitled “An
IRSEM report, in the shadow of a senior US officer. Where it is proven that Le Monde draws
its articles on China from the NATO swamp.”1024 In this text, at the turn of which he called
Tristan Mendès France a “swine” (crevure), the argument against us is twofold: on the one hand,
one of the two authors of the report, Jean-Baptiste Jeangène Vilmer, is “a member of the
Academic Advisory Board of the NATO Defense College” (which is false, he used to be, but
not since 2019); on the other hand, an American officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jordan Becker, is
among the associated researchers of IRSEM. And Vivas focuses on him, adding that IRSEM
“communicates to Le Monde materials for anti-Chinese articles” (image below). He even makes
it the tagline of his Twitter post, summarizing the IRSEM report as the work of “a Yankee
lieutenant colonel.”

The procedure is crude and is a string of fallacies. First, an ad hominem argument, i.e. attacking the person instead of the thing (ad rem) being discussed. Instead of answering on the
merits (what Le Monde or IRSEM have said), Vivas tries to find a link, whatever it may be, between the person and the United States and/or NATO – a link that would have, for him, an explanatory value for the positions defended in the report. He had already done it with Antoine
Bondaz (“dubbed by the State Department” because he participated in an exchange program
a few years earlier1025); he did it again here. Furthermore, he uses a “bad company fallacy,”
or “dishonor by association,” because the link with the United States and/or NATO is – at
least in Vivas’ mind – discrediting. The detour via the NATO Defense College or an American
associate researcher is also a diversion since it has no bearing on the discussion (on Chinese
influence operations or on the role of Maxime Vivas in Chinese influence in France). Last but
not least, there is a causal fallacy since Vivas deduces from a simple correlation (the presence
of an American researcher in the team) a causal link (which supposedly explains that IRSEM
“communicates to Le Monde materials for anti-Chinese articles”), without any proof of course,
by the sole work of his imagination, in a construction that may seem conspiratorial.
To answer on the merits, Jordan Becker is not only an American soldier, he is first and foremost a researcher, holding a Ph.D. in political economy, regularly publishing in reputable
scientific journals and it is in this capacity that he is “associated” with IRSEM, without being
part of the resident team (associate researchers are not physically present at IRSEM, in this
case Jordan Becker lives and works in the United States). His expertise is in transatlantic security and defense economy, not in China or influence operations. He was obviously never
involved, in any way, in the preparation of this report. He was not even aware of it until
its publication. And the authors did not need Americans to find “materials” that the PartyState itself, and its relays of influence throughout the world, leave lying around freely, as the
sources of this report show.
Finally, IRSEM has a team of about thirty resident and thirty associate researchers. Among
these sixty or so names, Vivas only named the sole American. But there is also on the team
(as resident, which should be worse) a researcher from the Singapore Ministry of Defense,

But Antoine Bondaz also did the Chinese equivalent in 2016, which neutralizes Vivas’ fallacious argument that should
logically infer that Bondaz is just as much “sold out to China” as the interested party points out to him (tweet from @
AntoineBondaz on July 11, 2021).

and, in the past four years, a German researcher from a think tank funded by the Federal
Chancellery. The fact that in this diversity the U.S. associate researcher is chosen and the rest
not even considered as potential explanatory factor is another fallacy of incomplete evidence or “cherry-picking.” If one follows Vivas’ logic, there would actually be more reason
to believe that the report was influenced or fed by Singaporean or German authorities than by
U.S. authorities.
This fallacious reasoning would not deserve a detailed response if we had not anticipated that
this U.S./NATO card would be played extensively to try to discredit the authors and/
or the IRSEM, among other ad hominem attacks which the Party and its trolls have now customarily used against those who dare criticize its practices.

Sonia Bressler’s cooperation with the CCP has also resulted in the birth of a Frenchlanguage journal, Dialogue Chine-France, published by the magazine La Chine au présent
(China Today). There are, in fact, two magazines with the same title, both meant to build “a
bridge between the Chinese and French populations.”1026 A digital journal was launched in
March 2020,1027 while a monthly printed journal has been published “in cooperation with
La Route de la Soie”1028 since its first issue in July 2020. We can find in these pages contributions from several individuals mentioned above. This initiative, launched in the middle of
the Covid-19 pandemic, can be interpreted as tied to Beijing’s efforts to muscle its influence
in Europe precisely when its image was hit.

Joël Ruet, founding president of The Bridge Tank (→ p. 318) reacts to the release of the first issue of the digital journal ChinaFrance Dialogue in March 2020. The dialogue he refers to, co-organized with the “Beijing Press,” is the “Sino-French Dialogue on
Civilizations” that The Bridge Tank had co-organized with the CIPG on October 21-22, 2019 in Paris (→ p. 321).

indicated that the journal was “edited by China Today […] in cooperation with La Route de la Soie”, but from issue
4 (October 2020) onwards it was “edited by La Route de la Soie Publishing, in partnership with China Today.” This
inversion may have been motivated by a desire to put the French partner forward in order to be less susceptible to
criticism of the role of China Today, i.e., the Party.

The monthly magazine, printed at approximately 2,000 copies, is sold for 3 euros and
widely distributed free of charge to influencers, including think tanks and ministers’ offices,
which did not fail to attract attention.1029 The link with the CCP is obvious since Dialogue
Chine-France is published by La Chine au présent, which is none other than the
French version of the magazine China Today. The latter is published by the China
International Publishing Group (CIPG), an organization under the CCP’s Central
Propaganda Department (→ p. 288). The La Route de la Soie publishing house assumes
this link since it indicated on its website that it “co-produced” this magazine with “La Chine
au présent (part of China International Publishing Group).” Besides, Sonia Bressler is a
member of both their editorial board and committee of experts,1030 along with Wang Shuo,
deputy director of the European Department of the CICIR, the MSS think tank (→ p. 126),
Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute
of International Studies (CIIS), the think tank of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
Christian Mestre, honorary dean of the Faculty of Law, Political Science and Management
at the University of Strasbourg (→ p. 409).
From Beijing’s point of view, this collaboration with a French publishing house is useful not only because it brings local relays but also, and above all, to “‘blur the tracks’ as
to the real origin of this magazine financed by the Chinese Communist Party” as
Antoine Bondaz explained.1031 For the same reasons, this monthly magazine tries to integrate French and international authors who are not necessarily stamped “friends of China.”
For instance, the 6th issue (December 2020) included an article by the mayor of Brest,
François Cuillandre, which he did not write: it “was directly commissioned by the municipality of Qingdao,” Brest’s twin city.1032

Sonia Bressler has long strived to denounce forms of “China Bashing”: in 2016,
she criticized the fact that Beijing had become “an enemy of choice for French media.”1033
In 2019, she told Xinhua she planned to “write a book to analyze the narratives in French
media on China. I started this work for which I have set aside all the negative expressions
they constantly read.”1034 Covid-19 provided her with a perfect opportunity. On April 23,
2020, she published a note for IRIS (→ p. 316) titled Le Covid-19: du China bashing dans les
médias français à la guerre qui s’annonce… (Covid 19: From China Bashing in French Media to
the War Lurking Ahead…).1035

Sonia Bressler’s note on China Bashing, published by IRIS (left),
and recommended by the Chinese Embassy on Twitter (right).

Therein, she denounced the criticisms formulated against China in the context of the
epidemic, which she assimilated to a form of racism or, at the very least, to unfounded
stereotypes. She also referred to it as a form of cynicism which entailed accusing China to
divert the attention of public opinion. Her paper also tried to demonstrate that China had
managed the crisis well, which was one of the Party’s narratives – namely, that China showed
incredible generosity and, above all, that there was no evidence that the virus originated in
China – which was a subtle way of giving credence to the thesis of an American origins of the virus (→ p. 589).

The choice of IRIS to publish Sonia Bressler’s note is part of a relationship that seems
well-established by now. In 2017, Bressler had already published a laudatory review of the
1st session of the Silk Roads Forum co-organized by IRIS and the Chinese Embassy.1038
In 2020, IRIS published Bressler’s note in a series edited by Barthélémy Courmont, senior
research fellow at IRIS, and who was reciprocally published by Bressler at La Route de la
Soie Editions (a book on Cambodia in April-May 2020,1039 and then an article in Dialogue
Chine-France in October1040 – a journal to which another researcher and the director of IRIS
also contributed, as we already mentioned → p. 317). Since January 2021, Courmont has
also been the editor of a book series at La Route de la Soie.1041
Generally speaking, this French ecosystem is characterized by a regular, even circular, overlap of actors who gravitate around the Chinese embassy and who are generally the same ones participating in the same events. As seen in the previous pages, we
find Pascal Boniface (IRIS) at FPI events, and conversely Jean-Pierre Raffarin (FPI) at
IRIS events co-organized with the Chinese embassy and publicized by Joël Ruet (Bridge
Tank).1042 Raffarin participates in events co-organized by The Bridge Tank and the Chinese
Embassy; FPI is a partner to other events sponsored by The Bridge Tank; etc.

VIII. Culture
Chinese influence on culture is twofold: influence on the production and export of cultural products to seduce foreign publics; and influence exerted on foreign cultural productions to make them conform to the Party’s interests.

A. The production and export of cultural products
“Culture is a country and nation’s soul,” Xi Jinping said in his speech to the 19th CCP
National Congress: “Our country will thrive only if our culture thrives, and our nation will
be strong only if our culture is strong.” Therefore, he called for the “develop[ment of] a
socialist culture” to “add new luster to Chinese culture” and “to develop a great socialist
culture in China.”1048 Three five-year plans have successively delineated China’s strategy for
cultural development since 2006.1049 This strategy supports and promotes the production
and export of Chinese cultural products abroad.
Cultural products, such as movies and TV series, music, and books, are powerful
vectors of influence if they manage to penetrate foreign markets and adjust to consumers’
tastes who do not necessarily share the same cultural codes. Today, movies and TV series
are undoubtedly the most powerful and attractive among these vectors. In 2017,
China’s Ministry of Commerce announced $90 billion worth of exported cultural products that year, including more than $400 million for cinema and other television products,
based on data by the National Radio and Television Administration.1050 Chinese TV series
have always been particularly successful in Asia,1051 and in Southeast Asia mostly. However,
China wants to diversify and export its television products to other markets in Africa, the
Middle East, Europe, and in North America. In 2017, China Daily reported that China
had translated more than 1,600 films and television products into 36 foreign languages,
including English, French, Russian, and Arabic. These were being broadcast in about 100
countries.1052
Several organizations are key in selling cultural products abroad. For example,
China International Television Corporation (CITVC, 中国国际电视总公司) is a
subsidiary of China Media Group (CMG) founded in 1984 to promote Chinese television products abroad. It has established partnerships with foreign channels to broadcast
Chinese programs, such as the “China Hour” broadcast on the Portuguese channel Porto
Canal since 2018, the first Chinese program on a Southern European channel.1053 The
China Radio, Film and Television Programs Exchanging Center (CHNPEC), one of the
main organizations marketing and promoting Chinese films and TV series worldwide, is

supervised by CMG and CITVC.1054 In order to accelerate the distribution of Chinese TV
products abroad, CITVC and the CHNPEC have set up various other platforms:
• The China International Film and TV Programs Exhibition (CIFTPE, 中国国
际电视总公司联合展区): an annual exhibition showcasing China’s products for export
and its progress in international cooperation. The last, 16th editionwas held in September
2019. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in June 2019 between
CITVC and the American National Association of Television Program Executives
(NATPE) which included, among other things, the promotion of the CIFTPE.1055
• The Film and TV Import and Export Association (FTIEA, 影视文化进出口企
业协展区), created in 2017 with the support of the State Council Information Office
and the National Radio and Television Administration, has more than 50 members
now.1056 The FTIEA organizes and takes part in international forums and other events
to promote Chinese creations abroad.1057
• The Belt and Road Media Community (BRMC, 丝路电视国际合作共同体)
meets yearly since 2016, during an annual summit organized by CITVC and CHNPEC,
to promote cooperation in the media and cultural sectors and to develop the influence
of the “BRI community” internationally.1058

1. TV shows
Chinese TV shows can be broadly categorized into three genres, depending on the time
period of the plot: “costume” or “traditional” series (古装剧), whose story takes place
– more or less realistically – in ancient or imperial China; series that have the – often
hagiographic – history of the CCP as a backdrop; and “realistic” or “modern” series that
take place in the present-day China. Several “traditional” shows have been met with dazzling success abroad, such as Story of Yanxi Palace (延禧攻略), Empresses in the Palace (甄嬛
传), Nirvana in Fire (琅琊榜), and Princess Agents (楚乔传).1059 This type of series seduces
with elegant costumes and sets, and it feeds the image of a rich, refined and powerful past
Chinese civilization. This image reinforces the legitimacy of the Chinese narrative according to which the emergence (or rather the re-emergence) of China is a natural fact, as the
country is just regaining the status of power it had enjoyed before Westerners inflicted “a
Century of Humiliation” on it (百年耻辱).
Despite some domestic successes, series and films on the Party’s history, which are always
challenging to evaluate since their broadcast is often imposed on TV channels, are difficult
to export. This category is best illustrated by Diplomatic Situation (外交风云),1060 a 48-epi1054. “GM Speech,” CHNPEC, http://archive.vn/hpSwk.

sode series that painted an apologetic portrait of historical leaders of the Party (notably

successes at the Bandung or Geneva conferences. This category struggles to reach international audiences and contributes little to propagating a universally applicable Chinese
narrative.

“Modern” series, such as Ode to Joy (欢乐颂) or Stay with Me (放弃我, 抓紧我) – which
have been very successful abroad – convey another image that Chinese authorities are
just as eager to disseminate. Whatever the plot, these stories, which take today’s society
as their backdrop, show an economically developed, modernized and prosperous China
– an image that the Party welcomes because it sees itself as the architect of this modern
China. More importantly, these series are seen as a powerful vehicle to “more adequately
tell” China’s history and to “better understand” today’s China as the victim of many
prejudices.

Other cinematographic achivements defend the country more straightforwardly. Operation Red Sea (红 海
行动) and the Wolf Warrior series (战狼) are patriotic action films that have been very successful upon
their release, both at home and abroad. The first,
released for the 90th anniversary of the PLA’s creation,
and concurrently to the 19th CCP Congress, honored
the PLA naval forces who were tasked with evacuating
Chinese nationals stranded in the midst of the civil war
in Yemen. Wolf Warrior – the second opus was
China’s biggest box-office success (it brought $870
million) – follows the adventures of a former Special
Forces member who goes to Africa to protect his fellow countrymen in danger. Movies like these defend
the image of a responsible China, a “mother country” ready to make any sacrifice to protect its citizens in danger, a message that undoubtedly primarily targets a domestic audience (to
strengthen its sense of national pride and confidence in the ruling authorities). These movies also show (off) the projection and combat capabilities of the PLA, the talents and
the sense of honor of the Chinese military. They convey an image that seeks to impress and

348

seduce foreign audiences in the same way that many Hollywood action films tend to reinforce the attractiveness of U.S. armed forces.
The science fiction movie Wandering Earth (流浪地球) is another example: in a future
world where humanity is facing imminent extinction and in which not a single American
is represented, a group of Chinese dares to fight to the end and manages to revive hope,
unify the remaining people, and thus to save humanity. The message is forceful and corresponds to a PRC narrative: China cares about the well-being of others and, in this sense,
offers an alternative to the American way.
The dissemination of these cultural products abroad –
when they manage to make room for themselves and
take hold in the market – makes it possible to make
Chinese culture, history, language and civilization
known and loved and they serve as a powerful vehicle
to defend a specific image of China: powerful, rich,
developed, refined and caring.

3. Video games
China also exerts a cultural influence through video games, an industry where it is a
major player. In 2018, four of the top five global companies in the sector were Chinese,
with Tencent leading the way. The Chinese market is the world’s second-largest market
behind the United States and was estimated to be worth $92 million in 2020.1061 Video
games are one of the very first cultural goods exported by China and, therefore, a significant vector of influence. They offer cultural worlds that are more easily adaptable
to the expectations of the global market than cinema and even more so than literature.
They allow China to export and make known typically Chinese characters or heroes
such as the monkey Sun Wukong from the Journey to the West. The Chinese market is
undergoing two important developments that could eventually facilitate the development of national companies on the international market: the expansion of games on
cell phones and on the cloud. The first, known as mini-games, are mainly the work of
Tencent, which offers them on its social network WeChat and on QQ. Cloud games
offer streaming access without the need for downloads, and Tencent is also a leader in
this market.
In recent years, Chinese video game companies have embarked on a very aggressive
strategy of acquiring foreign companies. Tencent, for example, now owns the U.S.
company Riot Games (Legends of Runeterra), the Finnish company Supercell (Clash of Clans)
or the New Zealand company Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile). The Chinese company
also owns 40% of the capital of Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite. In France, Tencent
holds a 5% stake in Ubisoft, the national leader in the sector. China’s penetration of this
market increases its influence and its ability to control anti-Chinese narratives or positions
contrary to its interests. However, video games are less readily associated with Chinese culture and are, therefore, only a secondary vector of seduction for Beijing. On the other hand,
it constitutes an excellent tool for disinformation.

B. Influence on foreign cultural productions
1. Influencing the cinema of others: the example of Hollywood
China’s strategy in the cultural sector and particularly in the production of cultural
goods is often summarized by the expression “borrowing a boat out to sea” (借船出海).
This Chengyu means in common parlance: “to benefit from someone’s help” or “to borrow someone else’s resources to achieve one’s own goals.” And, as the journalist Bethany
Allen-Ebrahimian puts it, “Hollywood is the world’s largest and most powerful boat,”1062
in the sense that it is arguably the most influential artistic and cultural medium.
In a particularly comprehensive report on the subject, the NGO PEN America, which
defends freedom of expression in the country and around the world, shows how, in order
not to upset Beijing and maintain an access to the gigantic Chinese market, “[as]
U.S. film studios compete for the opportunity to access Chinese audiences, many
are making difficult and troubling compromises on free expression: changing the
content of films intended for international – including American audiences; engaging
in self-censorship; agreeing to provide a censored version of a movie for screening in
China; and in some instances directly inviting Chinese government censors onto their
film sets […].”1063
This growing acceptance of Chinese censorship, PEN America points out, is
all the more disturbing because, while regularly producing “patriotic” films that contribute significantly to American soft power, Hollywood does not hesitate to chip away
at the U.S. political life and is seen as being out of Washington’s control – but not of
Beijing’s.
The problem is even more acute today as the Chinese film market is on its way to
become the world’s largest market. China’s quarterly box office revenues exceeded those
of the United States for the first time in the first quarter of 2018 and were expected to
surpass yearly U.S. revenues in 2020, becoming the world’s largest market, according to
estimates made prior to the Covid-19 pandemic that hit the film industry hard around the
world. Even though China became the world’s first market to regain its box office in August
2020,1064 the latest estimates indicated that the Chinese market will have to wait a few more
years before outperforming the U.S. market.1065 In any case, a trend is observable, and
because of its size, the Chinese market has become unavoidable for major American
studios. In recent years, blockbusters such as Avengers: Endgame (2019), Spider-Man: Far from
Home (2019), and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) generated more money in
China than in the U.S.1066
Chinese investments in Hollywood films have also grown considerably in recent
years: in the top 100 most profitable films worldwide, China contributed to financing 12
Hollywood films in 17 years (between 1997 and 2013), and 41 in just 5 years (between 2014

and 2018).1067 The offensive is blatant, and these Chinese investments give Beijing considerable leverage over the U.S. studios that benefit from them.
This dependence is not reciprocal: while Hollywood needs China more and more,
China needs Hollywood less and less, not only because the technical progress made by
the Chinese film industry in recent years allows for more Chinese productions to satisfy
their audiences’ thirst for blockbusters, but also because the “Cold War” with the United
States makes Chinese authorities and its public more hostile to U.S. productions. Whereas
Hollywood productions dominated the top 10 biggest hits in China before 2018, in 2020,
only one did, the other spots being taken by Chinese and Hong Kong films.1068 As the
Chinese market becomes increasingly important but also competitive, American
studios are encouraged to double down on their efforts to please Beijing.

a. Access to the Chinese market
There are three ways to access the Chinese market. The first is quota: according to
a Sino-American agreement of 2012, American films have 34 spots per year on the Chinese
market. These coveted seats are, in fact, almost exclusively occupied by blockbusters. For
some, this ceiling is more problematic than content censorship: the limited number of
American films authorized in China “is the real censorship that is going on. That
is the real limit on [freedom of] expression,” explained a Hollywood writer.1069 The decision-making process – the acceptance or rejection of a film – is vague. And this opacity
contributes to self-censorship because, as the limits of what is acceptable are blurred,
studios take as few risks as possible to maximize their chances.
The second way to distribute a film in China is the fixed fee or buy-out model,
whereby the foreign studio agrees to transfer all profits made in China to the Chinese
distributor in exchange for a flat fee. Thirty to forty films a year enter the Chinese market
this way, primarily independent films (blockbusters occupying most of the quota spots), to
which censorship is also applied.
The third way, which is increasingly used, is the co-production of a foreign movie
with a Chinese studio. It has several advantages, as the films in question are not considered foreign (e.g., they are not affected by the periods during the year when Beijing prohibits
the screening of foreign films to promote its domestic film industry).1070 However, co-production is also the formula that allows Beijing to exert the most significant influence
on content, with the Chinese partner playing an intermediary role with the censors: they
are present from the beginning and at each stage of the film’s creation. Besides, the China
Film Coproduction Corporation (CFCC), a division of CFGC, sets artistic limitations: at
least one-third of the financial investment and casting must be Chinese, and at least one
scene must be shot in China. For example, when a Chinese production company funded
40% of Looper (2012), reclassifying the film as a co-production, the character played by
Bruce Willis, who was to divide his time between Paris and Kansas, finally split it between
Paris and Shanghai, and was united with a Chinese woman played by Xu Qing.1071 Similarly,
in the book on which the film The Meg (2018) was based, the events took place in Hawaii,

whereas the film script of a U.S.-China joint production relocated it to China. In addition,
the scientists who were Japanese in the book became Chinese.
Co-productions are sometimes more or less hidden. For example, China: Times of
Xi, a three-episode documentary series aired on Discovery Channel in October 2017, was
presented as “an independent television production” when, in fact, it was the brainchild of
“a three-year content coproduction deal inked in March 2015 between Discovery Networks
Asia-Pacific and China Intercontinental Communications Centre (CICC), a company operated by the State Council Information Office (CSIO) – the Chinese government organ sharing an address with the Central Propaganda Department’s Office of Foreign Propaganda
(OFP).”1072
PEN America pointed out that what appears to be a protectionist measure on the outset
has another dimension in an authoritarian state where production companies are almost all
state-owned or controlled in some way by the state, where the actors are those authorized
by the Party, and where the authorities decide which scenes should be shot in China, where
and how, to portray only “a sanitized image of China.”1073
Furthermore, co-productions must also comply with a set of rules (Provisions on the
Administration of Sino-Foreign Cooperative Production of Films, 2004). Article 6(a), for example,
obliges co-productions to “be in accord with the Constitution, laws, regulations and the
relevant provisions of China,” to “respect the customs, religions, beliefs and living habits
of all ethnic groups in China”, to “facilitate the propagation of the refined indigenous
culture and traditions of China” and “the social stability of China” (social stability which,
PEN America noted, is one of the arguments used against dissidents or ethnic minorities,
especially the Uyghurs). Furthermore, Article 16 states that the film can only be screened
“inside or outside China” after it has passed the government’s “examination,” or censorship,
which occurs at any time, from the preliminary examination of the script to the verification
of the finished film, – and is conducted by the CCP’s Central Propaganda Department.
Government censors were present on the Chinese campus of DreamWorks Animation
to oversee the creation of Kung Fu Panda III (2016) for instance, a Chinese-American joint
production (China Film Group, DreamWorks Animation and Oriental DreamWorks).1074

b. Blacklists
The turning point came in 1997, with the successive release of Kundun, on the youth
of the Dalai Lama; Seven Years in Tibet, which showed, among other things, the invasion
of Tibet by China; and Red Corner, the story of an American lawyer wrongly accused of
murder in China. Not only did Beijing refuse to authorize their release in China, but their
directors and main actors were allegedly blacklisted and the production companies involved
prevented from working in China for five years.1075 Although China’s market was modest
in size at the time, comparable to Peru’s, Hollywood immediately got the message. Michael
Eisner, the then-CEO of Disney, which had produced Kundun, met with Chinese Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji in October 1998 in Beijing, apologized, and promised that it would

not happen again.1076 Indeed, the U.S. studios gradually conformed to the expectations of
the Chinese government afterward.
The blacklistings of producers, directors, or actors deemed hostile to China are
of varying intensity: they may be limited to a warning; one or more visa refusals; or
last for decades. Brad Pitt, who was (presumably) blacklisted for acting in Seven Years in
Tibet, was able to return to China in 2014 solely, while the director Jean-Jacques Annaud was
asked as early as 2009 to direct a Franco-Chinese co-production. On this occasion, in a letter in Chinese published on Weibo, which is now deleted but preserved and reproduced by
PEN America, Annaud issued an apology. He expressed his “deep regret” for the negative
impact that Seven Years in Tibet had in China and declared that he had “never participated in
any organization or association related to Tibet.” Furthermore, he had “never supported
Tibetan independence, nor […] had personal contact with the Dalai Lama, let alone been
his friend.”1077 After making amends in 2009, Annaud made up for his past decision by
making a film co-produced by a Chinese company (The Last Wolf, 2015). He also signed
“a strategic partnership agreement with China for two films in the next three years,”1078
also becoming a member of the Strategic Committee of the France China Foundation
(→ p. 268)1079 (and his biography on their website, which cited many of his films, still omits
to mention Seven Years in Tibet).1080

c. Cut or modify to suit
One of Beijing’s objectives is to censor content perceived as threatening, particularly the
five “poisons” (Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners, pro-democracy activists and
Taiwanese independence supporters) but also, more broadly, anything that could question
the CCP’s authority.
The simplest censorship is removing a scene, a shot or a line of dialogue following
a demand by Chinese authorities as a condition to access to the Chinese market.
Thus, in Pirates of the Caribbean 3 (2007), half of the appearances of Captain Sao Feng,
played by the Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-Fat, were suppressed in a completely assumed
manner (according to Xinhua), as Beijing considered them to be “vilifying and defacing the
Chinese.”1081 Similarly, the Chinese version of Men In Black 3 (2012) is 13 minutes shorter
than the original one: among the deleted scenes are references to Internet censorship by the
Chinese government – an ironic and self-defeating censorship, since it confirms what they
intended to conceal – but also the scene of a fight in Chinatown.
Hollywood studios also produced a Chinese version of Mission Impossible III (2006) without the scene in which Ethan Hunt kills a Chinese henchman and without a shot showing
tattered underwear hanging from the clothesline of a Shanghai apartment; or a Chinese
version of the James Bond movie Skyfall (2012) without the scene during which a Chinese
security guard is killed and without lines of dialogue referring to prostitution and torture by
the police. Same-sex kissing was also removed from the films Cloud Atlas (2013), Star Trek

Beyond (2016) and Alien: Covenant (2017).1082 Of course, PEN America noted that China is
not the only country in the world to censor films. However, the size of its market gives it
unparalleled leverage over Hollywood: while other states cut foreign films themselves,
after their initial release, sometimes in an artisanal way, and without informing the
producers, Beijing can force U.S. studios to produce an altered version of their film,
i.e. to do “the dirty work for them,” which also has the advantage of concealing censorship.1083
U.S. studios have an interest in internalizing the constraint because external and
post facto censorship can cost them time and money: time for the Chinese censors to
evaluate the film once it is made, to ask for the withdrawal or the modification of certain
scenes, which sometimes have to be entirely re-shot. All of this has a cost – and a delayed
Chinese release may incur additional costs if it comes after the U.S. release and requires
to reschedule the planned communication plan. Therefore, U.S. studios had adopted
internal and ex-ante censorship, i.e., self-censorship, producing from the outset the
most irreproachable film possible, being complacent toward Beijing to maximize
their chances of quickly obtaining an imprimatur from Chinese authorities. Meanwhile, and
to know in advance what Beijing’s red lines could be, the studios call on consultants, open
informal channels of communication with Chinese authorities, and use their Chinese partners – their Chinese distributor or instance – as “cultural intermediaries between Hollywood
and the censors.”1084 Throughout filmmaking (at the script, casting, shooting, production
stages), they hope to anticipate and avoid potential irritants, hence ensuring that the film
remains within the limits of what is acceptable to Beijing.
The examples of censorship cited above deal with Chinese versions that exist alongside
the original version. In some cases, however, self-censorship implies modifying the
original version, as shown by several examples involving Sony. The best-known is the film
Red Dawn (2012), which was supposed to tell the story of a group of Americans resisting
a Chinese occupation of the United States. That was the plan, and that is what the studio
filmed. However, after the filming, the Chinese soldiers were replaced by North Korean
soldiers “by digitally altering the Chinese flags and insignias into North Korean ones” (see
image below).1085 This change occurred after Chinese diplomats made the film’s producers
aware of the issue by using a production company with offices in both the US and China
“as a go-between and mediator.”1086

Similarly, Sony also altered the film Robocop (2014) to downplay the historical ties
between the US company Omnicorp and the Chinese government in the storyline, while
acknowledging in an email that this was indeed “censorship” (see below).1087 Also, Sony
had several scenes removed from the film Pixels (2015), including one in which extraterrestrial beings pierced the Great Wall: they decided to blow up the Taj Mahal instead.
Justifying the decision to change the original version of the film, one of Sony’s executives explained in an email that changing the sole Chinese version would have attracted
the attention of “the press to call us out for this when bloggers invariably compare the
versions.”1088

Other examples of rewriting include changing a dialogue about
the origin of the virus in the zombie movie World War Z (2013),
which was China in the original script based on Max Brooks’
(2006) eponymous novel (based on the SARS epidemic of 20022004). Dialogues were changed to conceal this Chinese origin, at
the request of the production company Paramount in the hope
of passing Beijing’s censorship – but this was evidently not
enough, since the film was not allowed in China, perhaps for
other reasons (Brad Pitt, perhaps still blacklisted, starred in it
and also co-produced it).1089 A Tibetan character was replaced by
a Celtic one in Dr. Strange (2016) and the Japanese and Taiwanese flags on Tom Cruise’s
leather jacket were erased from the trailer of Top Gun: Maverick (2020), a movie partly produced by Chinese Tencent Pictures. It did not go unnoticed.
Hollywood is a spectacular yet not unique case: there are other examples, elsewhere in the world, of films modified to avoid displeasing Beijing. A famous case is
the decision to cut the contribution of Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, a figure of the Chinese
political opposition, from the German collective movie Berlin, I Love You (2019), a compilation of ten short films.1090
“Over time, writers and creators do not even conceive of ideas, stories, or characters that would flout the rules [established by Beijing], because there is no point in
doing so. […] This all means, that censorship is most notable not for its presence,
but for the absence it creates: the absence of films, stories, characters, and plotlines
that would have existed – or existed in a different form – were it not for the power
of the censor.”1091

d. Add or modify in order to please
Chinese authorities do not simply have a negative objective (avoiding some content), they also have a positive objective: to promote certain other content, i.e. to
shape the Hollywood narrative on China in order to show the country in a positive, powerful, rich, stable, harmonious way. Speaking in Los Angeles in 2013, the president of the
China Film Group Corporation (CFGC), the largest state-owned film production and distribution company in China, reached out to US filmmakers (“We have a huge market and
we want to share it with you”), but with one condition to cooperation: “[we] want films that
are heavily invested in Chinese culture, not one or two shots […]. We want to see positive
Chinese images.”1092
Some had understood this for a long time, taking several measures such as including
“good” and empowed Chinese characters (which in itself is a good thing if it corrects
racist stereotypes on Asians previously found in Western cinema). But also filming more
in China and giving China the “right” role in screenplays, that of a country helping others and even saving the world – the films 2012 (2009), Gravity (2013) and Arrival
(2016) are examples of this trend.1093 Additionally, it can mean depicting China as the future
of the world: in Looper (2012), a character from the future invites the hero to go to China.
Correlatively, the same desire to please explains that, for some years now, “there [has
been] no more Chinese villains in American films.”1094 Americans are sometimes even
described in a less flattering way than the Chinese: in Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014),
for example, the bad guys were CIA agents whereas the Chinese government was responsible, efficient and benevolent, and on the “good” side – which made journalist David S.
Cohen say that it was “A Splendidly Patriotic Film, If You Happen To Be Chinese.”1095 As
a result, the film broke audience and revenue records in China. Another example that put
a smile on people’s faces was the Megalodon in The Meg (2018), whose action took place in
China: it seemed to prefer to devour and cut Westerners to pieces, while Chinese characters
fared better.1096
Other cases are more political. In Abominable
(2019), a Sino-American co-production (Pearl
Studio and DreamWorks Animation), a map of
the region that appeared in one scene displayed
the “nine-dash line,” i.e., Beijing’s territorial
claim on the South China Sea, a claim contested
by its neighbors. The UN Permanent Court of
Arbitration ruled in 2016 on a dispute between
China and the Philippines that this claim was contrary to international law (maritime law in that
case). This judgment, however, did not prevent
China from defending the “nine-dash line” by printing it in its passports, on T-shirts worn
by Chinese tourists (→ p. 405) or by slipping it into a Hollywood film. This practice did not
escape the notice of its neighbors: Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines were outraged

and called to boycott the film. The Malaysian government demanded that a version without
this controversial plan be produced for the Malaysian public, which DreamWorks refused,
leading the Malaysian government to ban the film. This case is an example of “a major
Hollywood studio refusing censorship from one government, for the purpose of better
adhering to the propagandistic expectations of another government – in essence, prioritizing the wishes of one country’s censors over another’s.”1097

#SupportMulan (2019)
In August 2019, when the shooting of the film Mulan (2020) neared completion, the ChineseAmerican actress Liu Ximeizi (刘茜美子) better known by her stage name Liu Yifei (or Crystal
Liu) shared on Weibo an image supporting Hong Kong police forces that read: “I support the
Hong Kong police. You can beat me up now. What a shame for Hong Kong.” She also added
the hashtag #ISupportHongKongPolice. It was shared more than 65,000 times in less than 24
hours.
Supporters of Hong Kong demonstrators then called for a boycott of the film using the
hashtag #BoycottMulan, after it first emerged on the Hong Kong discussion forum LIHKG
and quickly spread around the world. Beijing seized the opportunity to make the film a “loyalty
litmus test”1098 by supporting a counter-campaign using #SupportMulan on social networks,
going so far as to associate this hashtag with images comparing Hong Kong militants to the
terrorist group Islamic State. This coordinated campaign proved “inauthentic” because it used
fake accounts and bots – pushing Twitter and Facebook to delete incriminated accounts and
their associated pages.1099
Disney, which produced the film, was careful not to intervene in this controversy. PEN
America blamed it for its silence, which “further enabled Beijing to utilize the studio’s movie as
a tool of antidemocratic propaganda without pushback. [In conclusion,] the #SupportMulan
government-backed “movement” goes to show that even if Hollywood studios aim to make
their movies as inoffensive as possible – with the definition of “inoffensive” being highly
responsive to what Beijing declares as offensive – the CCP is more than willing to impose a
political agenda on these films, leveraging even unanticipated controversies as opportunities to
pursue their creative propaganda while pulling studios along for the ride.”1100

Sometimes, studios produce a Chinese version that goes even further, adding scenes,
products, dialogues, and cultural references
for the Chinese audience. For example, the
Chinese version of Looper (2012) contains several
scenes shot in Shanghai absent from its international version. Another known example is Iron
Man 3 (2013). The film had benefited from a significant investment by a Beijing production company and had partly been filmed in Beijing.
Subsequently, Marvel Studios made a Chinese version with several additional scenes to
include Chinese actors (including the actress and singer Fan Bingbing) and Chinese product
placement: For instance, to revitalize himself, Iron Man drank “Gu Li Duo,” a milky drink
from the Yili brand (which could be an attempt by the company to regain credibility after a
health scandal revealed abnormally high levels of mercury in their mother’s milk). Other
Chinese brands are also highlighted (TCL, Zoomlion). A group of Chinese schoolchildren
and Chinese doctors was also featured trying to save Iron Man’s life. In exchange, the film
received many “benefits, including an optimal release date, a more permissive government
attitude toward their film advertisements, and a ‘high degree of media access in China’ [and]
a promotional segment for the film on CCTV’s annual Chinese New Year gala, a highly
visible placement that would not have been possible without the Party’s active acquiescence.”1101

2. Other cultural sectors
The case of Hollywood is emblematic of China’s willingness and ability to influence
the messages conveyed by cinema. However, other cultural sectors are also victim of
pressure from Beijing to produce art that is compatible with the CCP’s expectations.
Denying access to the Chinese market is a common practice that targets all
artists critical of the Party-State, especially those supporting one of the five “poisons.” Many musicians, including Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Guns N’ Roses, Elton
John, Maroon 5, Linkin Park, Björk and Katy Perry, are persona non-grata in China because
they have supported Tibet, Taiwan, or “Chinese Democracy” (the title of a Guns N’
Roses album).1102 Through other types of pressure, Beijing hopes to encourage artists
to alter their works, to stop showing them elsewhere in the world, and even to
do the work of Chinese censors. In the following lines, we will only provide a few
examples of this practice.
First, regarding museums. In a context of “a hardening [in the summer of 2020] of
the Chinese government’s position against the Mongolian minority,” Beijing put pressure
on the Museum of Nantes, which had been planning an exhibition on Genghis Khan
and the Mongolian empire. To that end, Nantes’ museum had signed a piece loan agreement with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot (China), but the authorities wanted
them to remove the words “Genghis Khan,” “empire,” and “Mongolian” from the title.
Subsequently, the Chinese authorities sent a new contract to the museum in Nantes indi1101. Ibid., 26.

cating “that all the exhibition and catalog texts and the cartographic elements need to be
sent to China for validation,” as well as a new text introducing the exhibition in which
“the word Mongol appears on the twelfth page, Genghis Khan completely disappeared,
and the viewpoint centered on the Han dynasty.”1103 In other words, Beijing wanted to
make the Mongolian culture disappear and to use this exhibition as propaganda
for its national narrative. “Inner Mongolia, an autonomous territory, in theory, is very
much controlled by the central government, which intends to impose its language and
religion, those of the Hans. [For Beijing,] it is not acceptable that the exhibition puts
forward a discourse that breaks with the national narrative,” explained historian MarieDominique Even.1104 Hence, Nantes’ museum decided to postpone its exhibition until
2024 to find pieces from European and American museums instead.
Second, the video game industry. On October 6, 2019, during the Hearthstone
Grandmasters in Taiwan, Ng Wai Chung (吳偉聰), a Hong Kong-based professional
gamer known as “Blitzchung,” opted for mask similar to those worn by Hong Kong
protesters. He then declared “Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times.” Shortly
afterwards, electric power was cut off at the event. The next day, the Blizzard Company,
in which Tencent owns 5%, announced that Blitzchung was banned from participating in its tournaments for one year because he had allegedly offended the public and
damaged the company’s image. The Party, in this case, did not necessarily ask Blizzard
to sanction the professional gambler. However, the risk of seeing its market share
decline in China led the video game company to anticipate the Party’s demands.
In theater also, Chinese diplomats regularly try to ban performances they consider contrary to the CCP’s interests. For example, in 2017, the Chinese embassy put
pressure on the Royal Danish Theatre to stop a planned performance by the Shen Yun
dance company, which is linked to Falun Gong. Sometimes the coercion is so internalized by China’s partners that the Party no longer needs to exert pressure; local
authorities volunteer. For example, in 2018, the Royal Court Theatre in London gave
up performing a play about Tibet, not after being pressured by Chinese authorities, but
by the British Council, which noted that performing the play could harm the Royal Court
Theatre’s activities in China.1105 It was, therefore, a case of British self-censorship, so as not
to risk harming business in China. Notwithstanding, the play was eventually performed in
2019.1106 Self-censorship – allowing Beijing to win without a fight – is the desired
end effect.
Finally, in areas where the work needs a medium to be disseminated, such as pictures on
websites or social network accounts, Beijing frequently succeeds in having the content
removed by putting pressure on publishers. This is what the photographer Patrick Wack,
author of a photography book on Xinjiang (Dust, André Frère Editions, 2021), was made
to understand. Kodak had initially asked him to publish a dozen images on their Instagram
account, which they did, with an accompanying text provided by the author that denounced
the repression in Xinjiang. Then Kodak suddenly removed them, explaining that “the views

expressed by Mr. Wack do not represent those of Kodak and are not endorsed by Kodak.
We apologize for any misunderstanding or offense this post may have caused.” “I think they
got harassed by Chinese nationalists, and management got scared,” Wack believed.1107 The
message published by Kodak is indeed very similar to those published by the many private
companies that yield to Chinese censorship → p. 247).

IX. Information Manipulations
According to our analysis from our namesake 2018 report, information manipulations are intentional (thus assuming the intention to harm), clandestine (their victims
are unaware of it), and coordinated campaigns of dissemination of false or deliberately
distorted news.1108 They are therefore distinct from propaganda and public diplomacy,
which are carried out openly, in an assumed way. These manipulations correspond to
what Richard H. Shultz and Roy Godson, in a 1984 study on Soviet “active measures,”
called covert disinformation, defined as “a non-attributed or falsely attributed communication, written or oral, containing intentionally false, incomplete, or misleading information (frequently combined with true information), which seeks to deceive, misinform,
and/or mislead the target. […] In comparison with overt propaganda, covert disinformation usually is employed in a selective and discriminatory manner. This technique may
be advanced through rumors, forgeries, manipulative political actions, but also agents of
influence, front organizations, and other means.”1109 Today, the tools have changed – the
Internet and social networks have changed the information environment – but the idea
remains the same.
For Beijing, information manipulation, or secret disinformation, is just one lever
among others to infiltrate and coerce, as suggested by the position of this section
in this report, but an exceptionally dynamic and well-documented lever. Here, the
main actors are the PLA, notably Base 311 (→ p. 89), the CYL (→ p. 72), state media
– it is well established that, generally speaking, state media aligned with authoritarian
powers, notably Russia, China, Iran and Turkey, are both producers and amplifiers of
online information manipulation1110 – but also private intermediaries such as content
farms.

A. Simulate authenticity
1. Trolls, sock puppets and astroturfing
The creators of disinformation have a wide array of possibilities at their disposal on
social networks. False accounts or sock puppets are social accounts created under fake
personas by a person or group of persons to promote certain ideas or spread false information. These accounts are administered “manually,” by real people (they are not who they
claim to be) – unlike bots, which are automated accounts (robots), amplifying an activity.1111
Trolls, for their part, are Internet actors whose objective is to provoke controversy and
polemics. When these tools are used massively, it may create the illusion of authentic and
popular support for a policy or, if the actor is a company, for a product. In the latter cases,

the practice – disinforming by simulating a spontaneous popular movement – is called
astroturfing, in reference to AstroTurf, a carpet brand imitating grass (and a wordplay
based on the word grassroots).1112 Almost systematically included in Russian informational operations,1113 these tactics have been adopted by China, first internally, to
target its population, and then on the international scene.

a. Domestically: A distraction strategy to prevent dissident collective action
In 2017, an empirical study estimated that “the [Chinese] government fabricates and
posts about 448 million social media comments a year, [whose purpose is] to avoid
arguing with sceptics of the party and the government, and not even discuss controversial
issues. [But rather] to distract the public and change the subject, as most of these posts
involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other
symbols of the regime”1114. What is commonly referred to as the “50 Cent Army,” or “50
Cent Party,” because they are presumably paid 50 cents (€0.06) per post – a false rumor1115
– are more formally known as “Internet commentators” (网络评论员).1116 A 2021 study
shows that the Party has 2 million paid commentators, directly employed by Cyber Affairs
Commissions (网络安全和信息化委员会) and Propaganda Bureaus nationwide,1117 along
with more than 20 million part-time trolls, most of them students and CYL members.1118
The objective is to have as many of them as possible defend the same discourse so that
genuine network users do not dare express divergent opinions because they would seem to
be in the minority. Therefore, the goal is to frame the debate or, to use the Chinese government’s terminology, to “guide” (引导) public opinion, i.e., to manipulate it.
E-mails written in 2023-2014 and leaked from the Zhanggong district Internet Propaganda
Office, in which these “commentators” reported on their activity, provided the authors of
this study with a sample of more than 43,000 comments posted by Internet users identified as members of this “50 Cent Party.” King et al. maintained that they searched in vain
for evidence that some of these comments had been created automatically by bots. But
evidence pointed to the conclusion that “each was written by a specific, often identifiable,
human being under direction from the government.”1119
They concluded that there was a “strategy of distraction,” with peaks in the activity
of these commentators during events with “collective action potential”, like demonstrations or an explosion, but also during vacations, when idle people are more likely to
mobilize for causes, and before political meetings (strategic periods during which strategic
distraction is used in conjunction with, and complementary to, redistribution and repres-

sion measures).1120 In these sensitive periods, Internet commentators are asked to
“promote unity and stability through positive publicity” and “actively guide public
opinion.”1121 Approximately 80% of the posts fall into this category, which the authors call
cheerleading, i.e. promotion, positive advertising instead of debate and argumentation.1122
Contrary to the dominant thesis, which the authors call the “state critique theory” (censorship aimed at suppressing dissent), they defend a theory of “collective action potential.”
Accordingly, censorship aims to prevent collective actions not generated or controlled by the state, whatever their purpose or, in other words, whether or not this collective expression opposes the state or is even political in nature.1123
Another study identified several cases of mass publications of comments supported
by the Chinese government, including one connected to the G20 summit in Hangzhou
in 2016 and another to the explosions in the port of Tianjin in the summer of 2015.1124
In both cases, the effort was shiefly about writing “positive energy” comments (正能量)
in support of the Chinese communist regime. During the G20 summit, many messages
such as “I firmly believe that the Chinese people will be more united under President Xi”
and “let’s trust that our nation will be more prosperous and stronger under President Xi’s
leadership” poured onto Chinese networks while the Internet was being severely censored. It was partially meant to block humorous references to Xi Jinping’s gaffe during
his speech. He said “宽衣” (kuan yi) rather than “宽农” (kuan nong) – the characters yi
and nong being close – hence calling for “taking off one’s clothes” rather than to “ease
agricultural policy.”1125
Similarly, after the explosions in the port of Tianjin, astroturfers massively relayed praises
for the firemen and first-line workers, and support for the victims, keeping the discussion
away from any reference to corruption or to the government’s mismanagement of the crisis.
It involved messages such as: “Do not believe in rumors or spread rumors. Rumors cease
with the wise people. Let us all pray for [victims] and hope for their safety.”1126 Once again,
it was meant to “guide” the population and prevent the spread of feelings that could lead
to collective actions against the government and opinions that could tarnish the regime’s
reputation.
Finally, a more recent study based on the theft of more than 3,200 directives and 1,800
internal notes from the Cyberspace Administration Offices in Hangzhou City at the onset
of the coronavirus epidemic in January-February 2020 showed a more sophisticated censorship that involved discretion. According to the instructions, “[as] commenters fight to
guide public opinion, they must conceal their identity, avoid crude patriotism and sarcastic
praise, and be sleek and silent.”1127 The Cyberspace Administration issued its first directives in the first week of January, instructing news websites “to use only government-published material and not to draw any parallels with the deadly SARS outbreak in China and

elsewhere that began in 2002.” In early February, a directive required them to do more
than simply control information in China but to work to “actively influence international
opinion.” The press was asked not to use words such as “incurable” or “fatal” to describe
the virus or “lockdown” to describe restrictions on movements. A directive invited them
to avoid “giving the false impression that our fight against the epidemic relies on foreign
donations.” The documents also reveal that each of the “commenters” mobilized to shape
opinion about the coronavirus in Guangzhou alone received $25 for an original message
longer than 400 characters, 40 cents to report a negative comment to be deleted, and
one cent per repost.1128

b. Internationally: A more offensive strategy to defend Chinese interests
On the international stage, trolls are a lot more aggressive. They defend, attack,
sustain polemics, insult, and harass. In March 2019, many Reddit users felt that trolls
supported by the Chinese government were engaged “in a coordinated effort to spread
propaganda and bury anti-China messages on Reddit.”1129 Many newly created
accounts were massively intervening in the discussion, systematically defending Beijing
and attacking anyone critical of China. They upvoted or downvoted posts to promote
them or, on the contrary, make them disappear accordingly. The battle raged on certain
forums, including /r/geopolitics and Canadian subreddits (notably threads on Huawei
→ p. 133). The scale of this Chinese offensive was beyond what Reddit users had
become accustomed to with Russian trolls. A person knowledgeable on the moderation
of the /r/geopolitics forum explained that “in the past, /r/geopolitics had been targeted
by Russian trolls, who are generally the most well-known and active across various social
media platforms. However, in our situation, the pro-CCP effort vastly overshadows any
operation by the Russians.”1130 Here, again, it is difficult to know whether these trolls
worked for the Chinese government or were simply patriotic users. The fact that they
were so numerous, seemingly coordinated, and all repeated the same elements of language
(“You mention Falun Gong and it’s amazing, they just come out of the woodwork and all
say the same thing,” remarked one user),1131 however, seemed to indicate a certain degree
of organization.
While the PLA has developed its capacity to conduct trolling and sock-puppet operations, particularly on the domestic front (the so-called “50 Cent Army”), the Communist
Youth League (CYL) is also capable of conducting this type of operations both
domestically and abroad. It was behind the trolling campaign that hit the swimmer Mack
Horton after he defeated the Chinese champion Sun Yang in the 400m freestyle at the
Olympics.1132 The Australian athlete was subjected to a campaign of insults on his Facebook
page, receiving more than 40,000 messages from Sun “fans.” The CYL is better able to
work with targets between the ages of 14 and 28,1133 who make up a large proportion of
athletes’ fans.

To conduct operations against foreign targets, the CYL often uses Chinese students, who are the largest overseas student community, as well as Chinese of foreign
descent, to improve the quality of messages both in their substance – to resonate with
the target’s concerns – and in their form – so that the message appears to have been written by a local. For example, Beijing uses Chinese of Korean origin (朝鮮族 or Joseonjok in
Korean),1134 a minority that is very present in northeast China (dongbei) and among Chinese
students living in Korea.
Tara O unveiled a Chinese operation of active
measures in South Korea based on the student community of Korean origin mentioned
previously.1135 At the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic, president Moon Jae-in decided not
to prevent Chinese nationals from entering
Korean territory – against the advice of the
Korean Medical Association, which feared a rapid
spread of the virus. The Blue House subsequently
received a lot of criticism. A South Korean citizen
started a petition on the presidential website on
February 4, 2020, calling for the removal of
Message in Chinese giving instructions to
sign the petition in favor of Moon Jae-in.
Moon, believing that his failures no longer conferred him the legitimacy to perform his duties.
By February 25, the petition had been signed 300,000 times, and it passed the one-million mark two days later.1136 On February 26, as the number of signatures approached
800,000, a second petition, “We Support President Moon Jae-in,” appeared on the Blue
House website. In two days, it obtained more than 800,000 signatures, an exceptional
phenomenon (it took 21 days for the first petition, against President Moon, to reach
that number). The fact is even more disturbing since this mass signing occurred when
the epidemic was growing on Korean soil, in other words, when discontent against
Moon was high. On February 27, a Chinese of Korean origin revealed the existence of
messages in Chinese calling on PRC citizens present in Korea to sign the petition in
support of President Moon (see screenshot above). Of course, there is no irrefutable
evidence of the CCP’s involvement in this affair, but the cluster of evidence points to
Beijing and, more specifically, to the CYL. In just a few days, this operation reached
nearly a million signatures, which could only have been possible with a mobilization organized by an extremely powerful structure like the CYL (it can mobilize student networks in South Korea). In this case, it would constitute a new
example of active measures implemented by the Chinese to support a leader considered to be a friend of China, and to prevent the emergence of a popular anti-China
sentiment in a public opinion abroad. That said, the revelations in this affair made it
probably counterproductive.

appears in the body of the article.

2. Hiring middlemen
Another way to simulate authenticity is to have content published by third parties
in exchange for money – hence “hiring” intermediaries. A simple way, and one regularly
used by Beijing, is to use content farms: they create news for money. The purchase can also
target a one-time message or influence on a page or on an account, that page or account
altogether, or the recruitment of a person.

a. Content farms
Content farms (内容农场) are platforms hiring independent contributors to create
“clickbait” content that looks journalistic, but that is usually poorly-written and not very
original, uses keywords so as to be well ranked by search engines, maximize their views,
and generate advertising revenue.1137 “After creating the articles, content farm operators
recruit – and often financially compensate – individual social media users to help spread
them.”1138 The origin of this content, created by third parties and distributed by yet
another set of actors, is therefore difficult to trace, which is why Beijing makes extensive use of this subcontracting. “The PLA relies on outsourced freelancers in Malaysia
or overseas Chinese nationals to disseminate [disinformation] content” via content
farms,1139 paying between RMB100 and 1,000 (from €12.6 to €126) per message, based
on the length).1140

Earning money with KanWatch
The KanWatch Content Farm “was designed explicitly for users to be remunerated for sharing
its content. To sign up for an account, a user must first fill out basic information along with
an associated PayPal account. There are two ways to make money off of the platform: a user
can either share articles on their social media accounts or they can write articles. According
to the Taiwan Gazette, a single user can make about 10 Singapore dollars [6.2 euros] […] for
every thousand views a shared article receives. Users can also easily rewrite articles by pushing
a clone button. Other features on the KanWatch platform make it user-friendly and simple to
use. For example, a user can track their cash flow to see how much money they have made.
Offering monetary incentives for users to produce and disseminate content, regardless of
veracity, has proven to be a highly effective strategy for the CCP.”1141

An interesting development, notably observed during the 2020 general elections campaign in Taiwan (→ p. 461), is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by these farms
to generate content. The use of AI in Chinese influence operations targeting Taiwan
had already been mentioned in a May 2019 report by Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council

(MAC) and has since been confirmed by Peng Kuan Chin (彭冠今). He “created a ‘Content
Farm Automatic Collection System’ that crawled the Internet for Chinese articles and posts
and reorganized the words and sentences into new text, generating thousands of articles
per day. Peng’s software was modeled on automated software he saw in China, which he
believed no one else outside the mainland had.”1142
According to the Taiwanese fact-finding group MyGoPen, at least 60 % of controversial content and misinformation disseminated in Taiwan from these content farms came
from abroad. Most of the posts and articles that resonated with Taiwanese Internet users
appeared not to be spread from Taiwan.1143 In 2016, mobile01.com, teepr.com, bomb01.
com, ptt01.cc, shareonion.com, buzzhand.com and gigacircle.com were among the 100
most visited content farms in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore.1144 Some are
successful as quickly as they are forgotten; others thrive lastingly.
In general, websites referred to as “content farms” catch the attention of Internet users
on social networks. Facebook, which is used by more than 80 % of the Taiwanese population,1145 is a preferred platform to circulate these articles via pages that users can subscribe
to or within groups that they can join. Other networks can also be used: YouTube, Twitter
or LINE (a private messaging system from which users can receive website articles).
Mission
In Taiwan, the “Mission” content farm (密訊) was successful, particularly among communities that were politically positioned with the far right, sympathetic to the “Pan-Blue”
coalition around the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and opposed to the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its President Tsai Ing-wen.1146 A study by Cheng Yu-chung (鄭
宇君), a professor at the National Chengchi University, confirmed that Facebook pages
supporting the KMT tended to share Mission’s content. The latter even became
the first source cited in the week preceding the 2018 local elections in Taiwan.1147 In
October 2019, Facebook decided to suspend several content farms, including Mission, for
violating the platform’s rules.1148
To circumvent Facebook’s filters, Mission repeatedly resurrected itself by copying its
content onto various other domains such as missiback.com, pplomo.com, gyfunnews.

ID was very strong. It is a sign that allowed us to identify an entire network of content
farms that, at first glance, did not seem to be linked, as we will see later. Despite the
measures taken by Facebook, Mission broke the record of the most widely-shared website among Facebook users in Taiwan in one week in April 2019, with five times more
shares than the Liberty Times (自由時報).1149

The presence of content farms such as Mission was problematic because of their ability to produce content that can influence political debates and opinions. Mission fueled
narratives critical of Tsai Ing-wen’s government. It relayed information based on
real facts but framed in a misleading manner, for example, by creating the illusion that the
Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense (MND) was going to waste money by investing
in an old model of fighter plane (F-16A/B) when it was in fact a new model (F-16V). Or,
by distorting the $71 million in aid granted to Paraguay under President Chen Shui-bian (
陳水扁) for social housing construction: they claimed that $102 million was spent by the
Tsai government in Paraguay which supposedly resulted in Taiwanese “deaths.”1150
An investigation by The Reporter (報導者) revealed links between Mission and the
Taiwanese New Party (NP) (→ p. 447), which defends a pro-reunification position,
as well as with Chinese media.1151 The original source code of the Mission website contained the names of Lin Cheng-kuo (林正國) and of the Fang Hang Integrated Business
Marketing Co. Ltd. The spouses Lin Cheng-kuo and Liu Fang-yu (劉芳妤), the latter being
the Fang Hang company representative, are both members of the Taiwanese New Party’s
Youth Committee.1152 An analysis of the content shared by Mission also showed that if
often mentioned the Chinese website China-Taiwan.net (中國台灣網, taihai.net). The
website was piloted by the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) in Beijing. Once these links were
established, it was not surprising to observe the Mission platform relaying news under-

mining the legitimacy of the ruling party and promoting a pro-China and pro-unification
discourse.
Evan Lee and Yee Kok Wai
When Mission was confronted with Facebook’s suspension measures, the pages that regularly shared its content on this platform turned to other farms with similar content, such
as Big Durian.1153 Mission’s content was also copied onto other domains such as beeper.
live.1154 Big Durian and beeper.live are part of the same extensive network of content farms linked to an Evan Lee. Research conducted by The Reporter and Nick Monaco,
Melanie Smith and Amy Studdart’s investigations, showed that 431 Malaysia-based content farms had links to Evan Lee.
The Reporter described him as a man with a rich experience managing content farms
and as someone who would share his expertise with those experiencing difficulties via
a discussion group on Telegram.1155 In an interview with them,1156 “Evan Lee” denied
having a political agenda and asserted that his platforms are places of free expression.
The biggest “content farm”, according to him, is YouTube. He said he knew of six
Chinese-controlled content farms and three Taiwanese content farms with over 100 million subscribers, which work in conjunction with Facebook and LINE, but refused to
name them.1157
The purely commercial motivation of most players in content farms does not prevent some “farmers” from using them to advance their personal political opinions.
Previous work, notably by The Reporter, have identified a Yee Kok Wai (余國威), a
member of Evan Lee’s extensive network, allegedly from Puchong, Malaysia, and
whose account was already suspended by Facebook for violating the platform’s regulations. According to Yee Kok Wai, the pages he manages on Facebook have some
300,000 subscribers,1158 and the shared content generally comes from content farms
already mentioned, such as kanwatch, beeper.live and qiqu.news.1159 The pages he had
allegedly created after 2014 generally have a name that begins with “全球華人” (Global
Chinese), such as Global Chinese Military Alliance (全球華人軍事聯盟), Global Chinese
Golden Age Union (全球華人盛世聯盟), and Global Chinese Weather Union (全球華人風
雲聯盟). His positions in favor of the Chinese Communist Party – celebrating
the CCP’s anniversary or supporting the Hong Kong police for example – are in
line with the pro-Chinese content that is massively broadcast from the platforms
he manages.1160 Yee Kok Wai has also made Chang Dong-nan (張東南), from Taiwan’s
Chinese Unification Promotion Party (中華統一促進黨), one of the administrators of
his Global Chinese Alliance Facebook community.1161 He may also be associated with
the “Qiqi” network, for which he reportedly manages some Facebook pages.1162

Qiqi
The Qiqi network, which relayed the false information according to which Hong Kong
protesters offered rewards of up to $2.5 million for those who killed police officers,1163
is also part of the nexus to which Yee Kok Wai and Evan Lee belong. This fake
news, released in November 2019, originated from the official Weibo account of the party’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (中共中央政法委员会).1164 The Qiqi
News Network is made of many pages whose names begin with “Qiqi” (琪琪 or 琦琦),
such as “Qiqi World” (琪琪看世界), “Qiqi News” (琦琦看新闻), “Qiqi Military” (琦琦看
军事), “Qiqi life” (琪琪看生活). According to The Reporter, these pages operate similarly to
the Global Chinese network and were created by Yee Kok Wai after 2017. They have reached
several tens of thousands of subscribers.1165 The Google Analytics Tracking ID of these
pages is also the one mentioned above, which links back to Evan Lee: UA-19409266904.1166
According to a joint report by Graphika, the Institute for the Future’s (IFTF) Digital
Intelligence Lab and the International Republican Institute (IRI), they act in a coordinated manner: in the months preceding the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election, at
least 48 Facebook pages simultaneously promoted the same content from the same
domains of the Qiqi network.1167
During the campaign, Qiqi promoted discourses hostile to President Tsai Ing-wen and
to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in general. For example, Qiqi helped popularize
the expression “Green Terror” used to denigrate the DPP (whose color is green, while the
KMT’s is blue); it refers to the “White Terror” (白色恐怖), the authoritarian period in the
country’s history (between 1947 and 1987). The website “Qiqi pushes a worldview closely
aligned with the CCP, frequently uses mainland Chinese phrasings, and recycles articles
from other news outlets, often Chinese state-owned media.”1168
However, the Qiqi network, like other farms, publish content that is often apolitical (cooking, fashion, lifestyle, etc.). This phenomenon can be interpreted in two ways
according to Nick Monaco, Melanie Smith, and Amy Studdart. Firstly, as a way to build a
much larger audience than the one interested in political content, so that when the time
comes, political messages can be distributed to many more people. Secondly, as a more discreet way to convey a political vision of the world within or between these seemingly innocuous messages – a technique proven efficient by Moscow according to a former employee
of the Russian IRA (Internet Research Agency).1169

Screenshots of the homepage of the domains (from top to bottom, from left to right)
newqiqi.com, qiqis.org, xqiqis.com, hotqiqi.com, taken on 03/15/2021.

A series of new “Qiqi” domains have been created with the Covid-19 pandemic.
The “Qiqi News” page (琦琦看新闻 or 琪琪看新闻) has multiplied in several domain
names: newqiqi.com, qiqis.org, allqiqi.com, iqiqis.com, xqiqis.com and hotqiqi.com.
According to Cutestat data, the first four websites were created in February 2020, the last
two in June 2020. This new wave seems to be more sophisticated than the previous ones:
none of these domains gives an access to their source page, and they are not linked to
the same Google Analytics ID,1170 contrary to the examples previously mentioned, which
makes the visualization of the entire network less apparent. The topics covered by the
“Qiqi News” pages are much more politicized: the articles often deal with the management
of the coronavirus epidemic, particularly the efficiency of Chinese management and the
American mismanagement, Sino-American relations, Sino-Taiwanese relations, and political news from the Asia-Pacific region in general. According to Alexa and Cutestat data,
however, these websites do not attract much traffic. The dissemination of their content is,
once again, done via Facebook pages and groups, most notably the namesake “Qiqi News”
(琦琦看新闻), which has some 30,000 subscribers,1171 as well as the “Global Chinese” network mentioned earlier.1172
During the pandemic, this network spread many false news, including the conspiracy theory of the American origin of the virus (→ p. 589), either directly, via
iqiqis.com for example (one article entitled: “Confirmed: America is the source of the
Coronavirus. America has lied to the whole world,” one week after the Chinese MFA itself
launched this rumor);1173 or indirectly, by suggesting that non-Chinese sources came to the
1170. The Google Analytics domains newqiqi.com, qiqis.org, allqiqi.com et iqiqis.com are the following: UA161511720, UA-161524355, UA-161578722 and UA-161561752.

same conclusion: for example, a video from another website belonging to the Qiqi network
claimed that the Japanese television channel Asahi Shimbun (ANN) suspected that the
virus originated in the United States (a theory also pushed by Chinese state media) – which
was false, as shown by the Taiwan FactCheck Center.1174
Moreover, a DFRLab investigation proved that Qiqi and Qiqu (趣享网), another
Malaysian-based content farm, fed two pro-Chinese and anti-Trump Facebook networks
through coordinated inauthentic behavior.1175
Happytify
Happytify (歡享網) is another successful network with KMT-sympathetic communities
that has promoted sensationalist anti-DPP articles, especially in 2018-2019.1176 Interestingly,
the network was created by the Chinese company Nothing Tech Inc. (無為科技, or
Wuwei Technologies),1177 which is owned by Wu Junxian (吴俊显) and opened in 2014
with its headquarters in the Hebei Province.1178 The company presents itself as “the world’s
largest overseas Chinese we-media operator,” offering various services, including software
development.1179 “We-Media,” or “self-media” (自媒体), refers to media platforms whose
content can be produced by anyone such as with a personal blog. Nothing Tech offers to
help its clients promote their products on Facebook, design multimedia content, and
develop an international audience. Nothing Tech’s flagship product would be Happytify,
presented as a We-Media platform in traditional Chinese that operates outside of China.
The platform apparently attracts more than 6 million daily viewings – mainly Internet users
based in Taiwan, Malaysia, and in other Chinese-speaking regions – and appears to be the
most important platform producing traditional Chinese content on Facebook.1180
More than 114,000 subscribers follow the @happytify page created in 2017.1181 However,
some Facebook initiatives call for caution: the “Content Farm Terminator” page (終結內
容農場) published a list of 84 domains affiliated to Happytify in January 2019 to teach
users to be wary of content farms.1182 The domain happytify.cc also changed its name and
visual identity in 2018 to Huayu Redian (華語熱點), to cast off the tarnished reputation
undoubtedly.1183 Investigations on Happytify, however, could not prove any link between
the platform and Chinese state actors. The motivations may, therefore, not be political.

By mass broadcasting their articles on social networks to attract attention rather than
inform, content farms have become powerful vectors of misinformation, but also platforms that actors with an agenda can easily exploit. While it is difficult to prove a clear
and direct link between Chinese state actors and coordinated campaigns to manipulate information via these farms, the examples presented above do add some clues.

They show that the Taiwanese public is indeed manipulated to divide the population and
break the bond of trust with the government, which benefits Chinese interests, as we will
see in the case study on Taiwan (→ p. 453).

b. Other methods
To simulate authenticity by hiring intermediaries, operators can also use the following
methods:
• 1) Purchase one-time messages. The objective is to have a pre-written message
published by credible third parties. And this practice is used both online and offline.
For example, in April 2020, an intermediary offered 20,000 pesos (about 200 euros)
to the editors of several Argentinean newspapers – including El Cronista Comercial,
Diario Popular and the online platform Infobae (which allegedly asked for a higher price,
without success).1184 The intermediary wanted them to publish an anti-Falun Gong
article in “poorly written Spanish,” which contained false information intending to discredit this practice in the Argentinean opinion. It claimed that Falun Gong practitioners
in Argentina did not allow themselves to consult a doctor or seek hospital treatment. It
thereby suggested, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, that they would not make
themselves known to health authorities if they were carriers of the coronavirus, thus
putting the rest of the population at risk.1185 “What would happen,” the article asked, “if
a large number of these people refuse to go seek medical services in the midst of a global
pandemic?”1186 The article used the slanderous and demonizing expressions generally
used by Chinese propaganda to characterize Falun Gong practitioners1187 and a misleading version of the facts to present the history of the practice.1188 The case reached public
audiences thanks to one of the Argentine editors approached by the intermediary who
opted to contact an Argentine colleague who practiced Falun Gong instead. As a result,
the Falun Dafa Information Center and the Epoch Times newspaper obtained a draft and
exposed the attempt. The intermediary who made the proposal reportedly confessed
that he was working for “some Chinese” without any further details, while one media
outlet speculated that it was a request from the Chinese Embassy in Argentina.1189
Another example of one-off message buying, this time on social networks: some owners of Chinese-speaking Twitter accounts with more than 10,000 subscribers were
offered via private messages to publish posts for money, from RMB400 to 2,500
(€51 to 320) per post. The Australian artist of Chinese origin Badiucao (73,500 Twitter
subscribers) was offered RMB1,700 (€217) per message. He shared with ProPublica the
15-second propaganda clip he was supposed to post. His correspondents had apparently
not understood that Badiucao, one of China’s most prominent political cartoonists, was
an activist in exile because he was deemed a dissident by Beijing. This incident gave credence to the thesis of the use of commercial intermediaries who “are marketing

pros but, they do not have a nuanced political understanding.”1190 Another example: in May 2019, the Canadian YouTuber J.J. McCullough (250,000 subscribers),1191 who
was not particularly pro-Chinese (to say the least),1192 received an email from a certain
“Franco” offering him $500 (later $1,350) to broadcast an anti-Falun Gong video
– an offer that he not only refused but to which he devoted a video entitled “Chinese
propaganda and me.”1193

• 2) Purchase influence over an account. The YouTubers SerpentZA (South African,
781,000 subscribers) and laowhy86 (American, 544,000 subscribers), both married to
Chinese women and who have lived in China for more than a decade, are among the
most-watched YouTubers on the topic of China and they often collaborate to create
videos. They admitted that they were approached on numerous occasions by Chinese
“organizations” that offered them money and a very large audience if they altered
their content. For example, they explained that they were “offered [financial] compensation to play down some of the western media claims that Tibet and Xinjiang CCP
governments are oppressive toward their citizens, and even offered to fly us out to shoot
some positive videos promoting tourism in the region.”1194

• 3) Purchase an account or a page. Facebook is a major vector of disinformation in
Taiwan, and therefore logically a principal vector of diffusion for content farms. However,
many of the pages they used were removed in 2019. Therefore, content farms have tried
to buy Facebook fan pages: several page moderators were contacted by individuals
(whose origin was revealed by the expression “管管,” more commonly used in
mainland China to designate moderators) offering to buy their page. At the time,
the researcher Puma Shen (沈伯洋) recalled that “many people […] were selling fan
pages that they weren’t using anymore. This was just a way to make money.”1195

During Taiwan’s 2020 presidential campaign, PTT accounts, the island’s most popular
bulletin board system, were also sold – some on Taobao, China’s leading online sales
website. The most expensive accounts, the oldest and therefore most credible,
sold for no less than 200,000 Taiwanese dollars (€5,874).1197
• 4) Recruit a person. Social networks can also be used to recruit paid intermediaries. Amidst the political war against Taiwan, for example, there have been advertisements to recruit streamers, especially attractive young women between 20 and 25
years old, paid between RMB5,000 and 10,000 (630-1,260 €) per month to spread
pro-unification propaganda.1198

The fake articles that supported the takeover bid on Club Med by a Chinese company
At the end of 2014, the French tourism company
Club Med was the subject of a takeover bid that pit
the Chinese conglomerate Fosun against the Italian
businessman Andrea Bonomi. At the time, several
articles attacking the Italian bid flourished in the
French press,1200 all published under false identities.
Some of them had been built up over several
months and were present on several social networks, testifying to a relatively sophisticated influence operation.1201 These articles were apparently the work of a communication agency. The well-known technique consists in publishing
opinion articles benefitting the client, under false identities: “Invent a false name,” “both banal

universe to give credibility to the false identity.”1202 The client in question is usually easy to
guess since they are the one who benefit from the maneuver.

B. Coordinated campaigns on social networks
Since 2019, Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube) no longer refrain from identifying coordinated campaigns as originating from China. In August 2019, Twitter
announced that it had deleted about 200,000 accounts (and publicized information about
the 936 most active ones) participating in “a significant state-backed information operation.” The accounts in question, “originating from within the People’s Republic of China
(PRC),”1203 attacked Hong Kong demonstrators. Twitter did not imply any formal attribution,
but the evidence was clear. The ASPI described it as “a relatively small and hastily assembled
operation rather than a sophisticated information campaign planned well in advance.”1204
In September 2019, Twitter published data from 4,301 additional accounts involved in this
operation.1205 In June 2020, Twitter exposed two sets of accounts, one of 23,750 accounts,
the other of about 150,000 accounts, which published pro-CCP and anti-democracy content in Chinese about Hong Kong; social network moderators said they “attributed” this
operation to the PRC.1206 In September 2020, Facebook announced that it had detected
and deleted two networks displaying coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), one of which
originated in China (155 accounts, 11 pages, 9 groups and 6 Instagram accounts) and targeted the Philippines and Southeast Asia, but also the United States. Facebook established
that this network had “links to individuals in the Fujian province of China.”1207
As part of its “investigation into coordinated influence operations linked to
China,”1208 Google suspended several tens of thousands of YouTube channels in

2020. The Threat Analysis Group’s bulletins revealed that between April and June 2020,
2,596 channels had been suspended, as well as 3,773 channels between July and September
and another 7,479 channels in October alone.1209 Over the same period, between April and
October 2020, Google suspended only 200 other YouTube channels worldwide, 124 related
to Russian operations. Hence, the overwhelming majority of suspended channels were tied
to China. While these channels mainly published apolitical content (entertainment, music,
lifestyle, cooking, etc.), often referred to as “spam,” a small portion was political in nature
and was published in English and/or Chinese. This technique makes it possible to create
an audience before sharing political content more broadly. Among the political topics these
channels covered, Google cited the U.S. management of the Covid-19 crisis, the protests
for racial justice of the Black Lives Matter movement, the fires that ravaged the United
States, but also the events in Hong Kong. Google did not reveal the names of the channels
in question but specified that the results of its investigations were consistent with those of
Graphika (→ p. 379).1210
As we will see in subsequent pages, most of the information relayed by these false
accounts was poorly created, not very elaborate and easily identifiable – particularly
in the Chinese case where these operations are often botched. This differs from Russian
operations, in particular, a comparison we address in the conclusion (→ p. 620). However,
it is crucial to understand that their impact depends less on sophistication than on
repetition, which can create an “illusory truth effect.” The more an idea is repeated,
the more familiar it becomes, and the more likely it is to convince the public (whatever its
intrinsic weaknesses).1211 Therefore, actors involved in disinformation campaigns will not
always bother adopt an appearance of authenticity for the information they propagate. This
is the reason why Chinese actors, in particular, seem to put quantity before quality.

1. A persistent campaign since 2017
In 2019, the ASPI identified a campaign led by Chinese actors and targeting Hong
Kong demonstrations but which had already begun targeting critics of the Chinese regime
as early as April 2017 (see the report Tweeting through the Great Firewall). In 2020, they wrote
that this campaign had continued on Twitter and Facebook, that it was therefore
“persistent,” consistently “large-scaled,” targeting primarily Hongkongers and, to a lesser
extent, all Chinese abroad. The themes were well-known: first and foremost, Hong Kong
and exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, but also, to a lesser extent, the Covid-19 pandemic and Taiwan (their report Retweeting through the Great Firewall). The attribution to
actors located in China (even though Twitter is technically banned there) was confirmed
by the fact that 90% of messages were posted very routinely Monday to Friday, 8 am to 5
pm Beijing Time, with a clear drop at lunchtime: the accounts did not seem to be used the
rest of the time (early morning, late afternoon, evenings, weekends), which could indicate
a professional rather than personal endeavor.
The inauthenticity was further confirmed by the fact that 78.5% of the Twitter accounts
examined had no subscribers at all; recently created accounts with only a few subscribers

were reaching record levels of engagement with hundreds or even thousands of “likes”;
and among the rest of the accounts, some were “potentially purchased, hacked or stolen.”1212 The work was usually sloppy: the authors did not bother cover their tracks
or make the accounts appear authentic. The ASPI gave the example of an account initially
held by a Frenchman who, in March 2020, suddenly started tweeting only in English and
Chinese. The photo had been changed (it was then a young woman) but the biographical presentation still referred to the original Facebook page, i.e., that of the French man.
Another French-speaking account tweeted “Test123” in Chinese before launching attacks
against Guo Wengui. Its operators did not even bother delete previous French tweets or the
test tweet. The ASPI termed this a “lazy approach” on both Twitter and Facebook: most
of the time, only the profile picture of the acquired accounts was changed, but not
the content nor the previous photos.1213 In other words, concealment was not an issue:
putting quantity before quality, they wanted to act fast and rake it in. Moreover, there
was some coordination between platforms: different accounts, under different identities
were posting the same thing on different platforms (Twitter and Facebook) simultaneously.
This is another symptom of inauthenticity.
It is likely the same information operation since 2017. The campaign was adapted to
the events (Hong Kong, pandemic, but also the U.S. presidential campaign) and it was
particularly robust since it resisted successive takedowns. The ASPI, which also emphasized
that its results converged with those of Graphika and Bellingcat,1214 noted that this network
could “have sourced, created or activated new accounts within a matter of days.”1215
In September 2021, a study by the U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant (FireEye) provided
new evidence. First, the campaign was much larger than previously thought, as it involved
no less than 30 different social network platforms and more than 40 websites and
forums, in numerous languages including Russian, German, Spanish, Korean and
Japanese. Then, the attackers “have actively sought to physically mobilize protestors in
the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”1216 This attempt, which does not appear
to have been successful, is typical of what Russians had also attempted to do in previous
years with greater success (pushing communities to demonstrate and clash in order to
divide a society) and is thus a further manifestation of the Russification of Chinese
operations (→ p. 620).

2. Spamouflage Dragon: an enduring network using fake accounts and fake
AI-generated human faces
Since 2019, Graphika has exposed a pro-Chinese network involved in at least three
operations. The first, from which Graphika drew a first report,1217 seems to have begun,
in the summer of 2019, to attack pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong in

Chinese and the exiled billionaire and CCP critic Guo Wengui. The network used
hundreds of YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter accounts (those involved were among the
936 accounts identified by Twitter on August 19, 2019 as participating in “a significant
state-backed information operation”; the accounts “originat[ed] from within the PRC”).1218
Most of the accounts were hijacked or reused: despite having Western, Slavic, and
Bangladeshi names and profiles, they published in Chinese. The videos they published
were then amplified (shared, commented on) by groups of fake accounts. Some
political messages (in this case, attacking Hong Kong demonstrators and Guo Wengui)
were interspersed within a mass of harmless photos and videos (landscape, poetry, sport)
– perhaps used as camouflage – hence the name chosen by Graphika: “Spamouflage.”1219
Sometimes “different accounts posted the same content in the same order, suggesting that they were automated.”1220 In September 2019, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube
thought they had dismantled this network by deleting the accounts and pages involved. In
reality, the network simply downsized and depoliticized its activity to pass “under the radar.”
The network was back for a second operation in early 2020, from which Graphika drew
a second report.1221 This operation’s objective was to defend China, which received much
criticism at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. The operation seems to have been
“galvanized,” in late January, by the decision of U.S. authorities to ban travelers from China.1222
The network reactivated dormant accounts. For example, one of them, the Facebook page
画苑之花 (“Flower of the Garden”), was created in January 2019 under a Bangladeshi name.
The page started by publishing landscape images in English, then participated in the first operation on Hong Kong and Guo by posting a mixture of political messages and landscapes
(“spamouflage”), before laying low in the last months of 2019, and finally returning at the
very end of January 2020 to defend Beijing against criticisms of its management of the epidemic. The Graphika team deduced that the Flower of the Garden page “was a commercial acquisition, created by users unrelated to the network (perhaps in Bangladesh),
obtained by the operation around the time of the first disruption, but then run in
an online variation on “stealth mode” until the operators decided to turn up the volume.”1223 Another example on Twitter: one of the accounts involved in this second operation,
in March 2020, @kstaceee (Kathryn Stacey), was created in 2009, published in English, then
turned silent in 2013; it republished a few commercial tweets between 2016 and 2019, then
began posting in Chinese in October 2019, participating in the first operation against Hong
Kong demonstrators. Therefore, it could be “an account created by a genuine individual but
abandoned in 2013, hijacked and repurposed by a commercial operator in 2016, and then taken
over by Spamouflage Dragon in late October 2019.”1224 Examples like these are numerous.
As it reactivated old accounts, this network also acquired or created others, some
to disseminate content, others to amplify it. Disseminated and amplified videos,
often taken from Chinese state media, praised the CCP’s handling of the health
crisis. Like the first time, some accounts interspersed them with a mass of innocuous messages and videos taken from TikTok. On Facebook, the involved pages usually had between

4,000 and 4,900 users, just below 5,000, without ever reaching this threshold beyond which
the transparency settings automatically show where the page is administered from; it may
seem intentional. Moreover, their engagement rate was far below what could have been
expected from a page actually followed by such a high number of (real) people: it could
“indicate a policy of purchasing enough followers to make the assets look authoritative,
without obtaining so many that they triggered the transparency setting.”1225
The effectiveness of this maneuver was limited because, as Graphika observed, it “failed
to break out of its own echo chamber. All the likes, shares, and comments on the network’s
posts […] came from other members of the network.”1226 In other words, Spamouflage
Dragon’s activity was circular. Like for the first operation, as soon as the maneuver was
exposed (in April), the platforms deleted the accounts involved.
The network came back in June 2020 for a third operation, which resulted in a third
Graphika report.1227 This time it targeted the United States and the Trump administration in the context of the Sino-American “Cold War.” It particularly battered “its foreign policy, its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its racial inequalities, and its moves
against TikTok.”1228 There were two novelties compared to previous campaigns: first,
this one was conducted in English, mainly through videos. The quality was not perfect (“the videos were clumsily made, marked by language errors and awkward automated
voice-overs.”),1229 but the attackers showed a certain reactivity to current events, such as
with a speech by an American official. They were able to create and broadcast videos
in English within 36 hours. Then, some of the accounts posting them on YouTube
and Twitter had profile pictures created by generative adversarial networks (GANs,
i.e. AI): they were the fabricated faces of non-existent people. This relatively new
technique had already been observed in another case in 20191230 and on LinkedIn, where
some fake profiles are sometimes illustrated with photos generated in this way, notably by
intelligence services that use LinkedIn as a recruitment method.1231 For example, the nine
faces below, which are profile pictures of YouTube users who have commented on one of
the videos in question, are fake: they were all generated in this way.

The same increasingly-common method of creating faces using artificial intelligence has been used in other operations, one of which – named “Naval Gazing” by
Graphika – focused on the Sino-American rivalry in the South China Sea between 2016 and
2020.1232 Fake Facebook accounts whose profile pictures had either been stolen or generated by artificial intelligence attacked the Taiwanese president and supported the presidents
of the Philippines and Indonesia. Some were also posing as Americans supporting different
candidates in the 2020 presidential campaign. In all cases, the interventions were dominated
by maritime security and the defense of Chinese maritime interests. Another operation,
also exposed by Graphika, used images generated by artificial intelligence to create fake
profiles, on Twitter this time, to defend Huawei against the project of the Belgian government to limit the access of Chinese companies to its 5G network in 2020.1233
Meanwhile, the Spamouflage network continued to grow, with some interesting developments that prompted Graphika to publish a fourth report.1234 First of all, the network’s
three initial operations, to attack Hong Kong demonstrators, defend China during the
Covid-19 pandemic, and attack the United States, only had a limited impact, despite their
switch to English with the third operation; operators were unable to “break out”
of their own echo chamber, i.e., to develop a sufficient reach outside their network.
However, in late 2020 and early 2021, they were met with some success: the network’s messages were actually amplified by important external accounts, including “the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, a Pakistani politician, a senior figure at Huawei
Europe, UK commentator and former member of parliament George Galloway, and four
YouTube channels for Chinese viewers with tens of thousands of followers.”1235 Another
shift identified by Graphika was the development of seemingly authentic accounts,
in the sense that, unlike hundreds of others who did not even bother to conceal their
inauthenticity, they invested in persona development. As a result, the authenticity of
these new accounts drove more engagement with the content. Spamouflage also broadened its focus, which largely overlapped with Chinese diplomats who had themselves
retweeted the network’s accounts several hundred times, leading Graphika to say that
“spamouflage increasingly resembles a state-aligned propaganda network that
boosts, and is boosted by, the Chinese government.”1236 Moreover, the network was
also increasingly aggressive toward the United States. The decline of America. Became
its main narrative, which carried a broader message: the superiority of the Chinese model
over liberal democracy.

Between August 2019 and March 2020, ProPublica also identified “more than 10,000
suspected fake Twitter accounts involved in a coordinated influence campaign with
ties to the Chinese government.”1237 Some of these accounts had been hacked: ProPublica
gave examples of the initially authentic accounts of “a professor in North Carolina; a

graphic artist and a mother in Massachusetts; a web designer in the U.K.; and a business
analyst in Australia,” stolen from their owners and which subsequently posted pro-Beijing
propaganda in Chinese and/or English. Other accounts used vernacular Cantonese with
traditional Chinese characters to impersonate Hongkongers – but errors sometimes
appeared with simplified Chinese characters, revealing the account operator’s mainland origin. Those who held the accounts at the time were not necessarily the ones who stole them:
they could simply have bought them on a black market, where pirates sell existing
accounts that have the double advantage of already having (sometimes many) subscribers and of appearing credible since they were initially real accounts, with no link to
the causes for which they can be used afterward. The most credible accounts, because they
were initially real accounts and kept a real profile picture (of a real person), were used to
spread the messages first, which were then amplified (republished, liked, commented on)
by an army of more obviously false accounts.
Here again, a cluster of clues linked this network of false accounts to the CCP:
not only were the timeline and content of the messages aligned with the Chinese political agenda (first Hong Kong, then the pandemic), to the point that the messages were
sometimes literally copy-pasted from official CCP communiqués, but these accounts (of
people supposedly located all over the world) were mainly active during Beijing working hours – an observation also made by the ASPI in another study.1238 Furthermore,
ProPublica linked these accounts and this informational operation to a Beijing-based
digital marketing company, OneSight Technology Ltd, which “bills itself as the
top overseas social marketing company in China. It contracts with domestic companies and government agencies to help them market their brands or goods on social
media seen outside of China.” It offered, among other services, “to post messages en
masse across a number of accounts on overseas social media platforms including Twitter
and Facebook.” Its CEO, Li Lei, was apparently a former employee at Beijing’s Foreign
Propaganda Department. Among his clients: China Daily, CGTN, and the country’s
two main news agencies, Xinhua and China News Service (which are supervised by the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) and, since 2018, by the UFWD (United Front
Work Department), which absorbed OCAO). ProPublica obtained a copy of a contract
worth RMB1,244,880 (€159,136) between OneSight and China News Service to increase
the latter’s Twitter visibility.1239

4. Targeted botnets from Serbia to Xinjiang
A substantial rapprochement between China and Serbia has been taking place
since 2014, and has accelerated since 2017. Beijing is more broadly interested in the Balkans
and countries of Central and Eastern Europe (→ p. 310). And Serbia has a twofold advantage: it is not a EU member (therefore a priori more sensitive to a vision, concepts, and
initiatives hostile to the EU), but a candidate (and therefore well-positioned to serve as a
Trojan horse when the time comes). The Balkans are a strategic priority for Beijing,
and Serbia is at the “heart” of this strategy.1240

China opened a Confucius Institute in Belgrade in 2006, another in Novi Sad in 2017,
signed a large number of academic partnerships, has provided content to the Serbian
media, poured billions of euros into Serbia, built a €45 million cultural center in place of
the Chinese embassy bombed by NATO in 1999, and it carries out very active propaganda
in the country with the help of local relays. One of them is the Center for International
Relations and Sustainable Development. This Serbian think tank was partly funded by the
conglomerate CEFC China Energy (before it went bankrupt in March 2020 → p. 165) and
promoted the BRI and Sino-Serbian friendship.1241 Since 2020, there have also been joint
patrols of Serbian and Chinese police in the streets – the visible part of a cooperation
between security forces that could, in the future if not already, enable Beijing to better monitor and control all those belonging to the vast and diffuse category of “overseas Chinese”
(→ p. 165) in Serbia. The rapprochement is so spectacular that it has been said that “China
[had] overtaken Russia as Serbia’s Great Ally.”1242
Thus, Serbia was logically a Chinese priority during the Covid-19 pandemic, and
the Chinese aid was greatly amplified on social networks. An analysis of 30,000
tweets posted by Serbian accounts between March 9 and April 9, 2020 containing
the words “Kina” (China) and “Srbija” (Serbia) showed that bots produced no less
than 71.9% of them.1243 Some of the used accounts were old (created as early as 2009), but
many (954) were created for the occasion in the first quarter of 2020. More than 85% of
the tweets from these bots were retweets: their objective was, therefore, to amplify existing
content rather than distribute new content. They praised the Sino-Serbian friendship
and the Chinese aid given to Serbia during the pandemic, as well as the Serbian
government for its management of the crisis, while criticizing the inaction and lack
of solidarity of the European Union (despite the fact that the EU immediately released
15 million euros to assist Serbia). One of the accounts most often mentioned in these
tweets was Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić’s, who stated that he trusted his “friend and
brother” Xi Jinping, that China was the only country that could help them, as “European
solidarity does not exist.”1244 The accounts of the Serbian Prime Minister and the Chinese
ambassador to Serbia were also, but to a lesser extent, regularly mentioned.
In December 2019, the ASPI uncovered another similar network of false accounts
that tried to influence the discussions on Xinjiang.1245 The campaign was launched
during the adoption of a bill by the US House of Representatives calling for sanctions
against Chinese Party-State executives responsible for the mass internment of Uyghurs in
Xinjiang.1246 All of the identified accounts used the profile picture of a celebrity (Emma
Stone, Chris Evans, Lily Collins, Keira Knightley…) and retweeted content from Chinese
media to amplify it, in particular the Global Times and Chinese government sources. They
strived to impose sources in line with the Chinese version of the facts concerning the
camps which, according to the official narrative, are education centers.

A study showed that nearly half (46.3%) of the tweets that quoted the hashtag #forzaCinaeItalia (“Go China and Italy”) and more than a third (37.1%) of those quoting the
hashtag #grazieCina (“Thanks China”) between March 11 and 23, 2020, were created
by bots.1247 The Chinese Embassy in Italy had initiated the movement by tweeting an image
untitled “Forza Cina e Italia!” on February 24; then the hashtag #forzaCinaeItalia was used on
March 11. After that date, it was abundantly reproduced.

C. Discredit, divide, and scare opponents
An essential aspect of these campaigns, especially the one identified by the ASPI and
other likeminded groups (Graphika, Bellingcat), which have been persistent on Twitter and
Facebook since 2017, is that they do not solely defend China. Promoting the Chinese
model means degrading other models at the same time, especially liberal democracies, something that Russian influence operations have been doing for years
(→ p. 620). At least three tactics are regularly employed to this end.
First, they discredited the adversary’s capability – which is also, correlatively, a way
of praising China’s own resources by comparison. This process was frequently used during
the Covid-19 pandemic. Several tweets were published in a globally coordinated campaign
that targeted different countries (Canada, Finland, Japan, and the United States). They presented themselves as personal testimonies of Chinese living abroad, with local references,
but they were, in reality, the same text with gaps filled depending on the context:
____ has already lost control of the pandemic. I heard from a friend in a _____ hospital that numberless people are trying to get diagnosed every day, but there are no tests, they just get sent back
home. ____ has a large elderly population; lots of them just have to die at home. If you do not get
diagnosed, then you do not count as having got the disease, which is how _____ is keeping its num1247. Gabriele Carrere and Francesco Bechis, “Così la Cina fa propaganda in Italia, con i bot. Ecco l’analisi su

The attacks against liberal democracies were not limited to their capacity to manage
health crises: they targeted above all the legitimacy of their institutions, and therefore the
democratic model itself. One of the most widespread ideas here developed was that democracies are not only inefficient but also unstable and chaotic. Any image of disorder (demonstrations, damage to public property, burning cars, crimes, etc.) was amplified to confirm
the superiority of the Chinese authoritarian model. From this point of view, the assault
on the Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 provided Chinese
media and trolls with an almost inexhaustible source of criticisms against the democratic model – presumably embodied in Washington – and a powerful example to
denounce the alleged “double standards” between the said-comparable situations of Hong
Kong and Washington, as illustrated by montages published by the Global Times (see below).

Second, they fuel the flames of divisive issues, particularly racism and police violence in the United States. Some messages were purely critical, giving the image of a country fighting a civil war, without making any connection to China – this is the “Russian”
approach (→ p. 620). Others drew a parallel between the violence in the United States
and in Hong Kong to denounce the supposed hypocrisy (i.e. double standards) of the
Americans.
China’s campaigns on social networks that targeted the United States during
the presidential campaign were not clearly partisan. But, following the example of the
Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) four years earlier, they supported both sides of
a divisive issue to add fuel to the fire. A special effort was dedicated to the racial issue
(because it was particularly divisive). For example, Chinese operators broadcast “messages
in support of both the Black Lives Matter and pro-police Blue Lives Matter movements.
The point was not to take a side but rather to boost divisiveness by amplifying competing,
emotionally-charged view points.”1249

On the Bilibili platform, the CYL distinguished itself in June 2020 by broadcasting videos exploiting the death of George Floyd to “denounce” the racism of the U.S.
government. One of them, published on June 3, which is captured below, was entitled:
“In a few words: they obtained freedom in 1862, so why is it that black Americans still can’t
breathe.” “In a few words” is a series broadcast by Guanchazhe (观察者 – “the observer”),
a medium created in 2012 that presents itself as a forum analyzing international issues.
It displays views close to the government’s. In the video mentioned above, the authors
presented African Americans as an oppressed nation within the United States; they also
suggested that the FBI was responsible for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In
addition, the video claimed that white Americans created the superhero Black Panther to
obscure the true history of the Black Panther movement. This statement was evidently
false. One only needs to check the chronology of events to ascertain the truth: the Marvel
hero made his first appearance in Fantastic Four in July 1966, whereas the African-American
Maoist movement was created the following October. Marvel was, therefore, unable to
create the character to fight against the Black Panthers. Nor has it been established that
Marvel’s hero exerted any influence in the choice of the Black Panthers’ name.

George Floyd’s death has thus been used in many media content and in a number of
ways, including artistic images such as the one titled To Breath by “warrior wolf artist”

Anti-Chinese racism – which is sometimes real, there is no denying it – also gives rise
to manipulated information. For example, in April 2021, a video circulatied on social networks in China and Southeast Asia in which an Asian man, on the ground and bleeding,
was violently beaten by dozens of Spanish-speaking men, armed with sticks. The video
(captured below) was posted with the following message: “In California, USA, blacks and
whites kill Chinese. Forward to the whole of China!”

not an isolated case: the exploitation of racist anti-Asian acts, whether real, alleged,
or fabricated, is one of the leitmotifs used by Chinese propaganda to denigrate the United
States but also, more generally, “the West” – especially countries with large Asian communities, such as Australia and Canada.
The United States is not the only one affected by attempts to divide the country. In Seoul, too, there have been more repeated attempts to intervene in divisive
debates to inflame tensions. Suspecting that Chinese agents were invading Koreanlanguage forums and discussion groups, some Internet users started an experiment in early
2020. They created a fake online debate by posting links pointing to websites banned in
China to trap Chinese Internet users. A significant number of those who clicked on the
links then started posting the same comment, simply saying, in Korean, “I am an individual” – an incomprehensible phrase that some interpreted as a kind of code to indicate to
the Chinese services monitoring the web that they had found themselves on these banned
websites against their will. This experience sparked a debate, with some politicians stressing
the need to legislate to prevent this kind of manipulation.1252

The psychological manipulation of denying proven facts and defending false assertions
with the effect of destabilizing the convictions of the target audience and disturbing
their sense of reality is called gaslighting, which refers to the eponymous movie directed by
George Cukor – itself inspired from the play Angel Street written by Patrick Hamilton – in
which the husband manages, using various stratagems, to make his wife doubt her own mental
health.1253 Beyond the abusive interpersonal relationship, this psychological concept can be
applied on a broader scale, such as between those who govern and those who are governed:
the behavior and words of President Donald Trump, for example, have more than once been
described as gaslighting.1254 The CCP has also engaged in this kind of manipulation. If one
cannot scientifically prove someone’s intention, one can at least identify many cases where
the Party openly lied, distorted reality, or sought to rewrite history, with the effect
of creating possible confusion among the public. To take a recent example, the Party
sought to deflect from its short-sightedness at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis,
glorifying doctor Li Wenliang who had previously been accused of spreading false rumors,
censoring the first testimonies of the crisis that contradict the official version of controlled
management.1255 This distortion was carried out by downplaying the public number of infected people and deaths,1256 and by criticizing foreign countries for not having taken the virus
seriously – although, at the beginning of the crisis, China claimed that the situation was under
control and that foreign countries should not suspend their air links with it.
Through Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian (and other figures), China has also
caused unrest among domestic and foreign audiences by spreading the rumor according to
which the virus was brought to China by U.S. military personnel (→ p. 596). Similarly, Chinese
authorities distorted the reality of the protests in Hong Kong by claiming that the protesters

were ultra-minority or violent troublemakers or that protests were fomented by a foreign actor
aiming to destabilize the authorities. They used the same technics that in their attempts to erase
the Tian’anmen Square events of 1989 from collective memory, or when they claim that the
camps in Xinjiang are merely educational centers to improve the participants’ living conditions
with these “vocational education and training institutions.”1257 The presence of these competing versions of reality so zealously defended in the media and on the networks takes effect as
soon as the public is so troubled that they no longer know which version of the facts to believe. Even without creating a definite adherence to one’s own discourse, the gaslighter
hits its target as soon as the latter no longer manages to trust the proven version of the
facts, which, at least in the case of China, makes it possible to reduce the extent or vehemence
of the criticisms it faces on these subjects.

Third, another tactic is to fuel the fire of fear and try to create a panic. In March 2020,
millions of Americans received alarmist text messages that exaggerated the magnitude of the pandemic and announced an imminent containment, and a suspension of New
York City’s public transportation. It also encouraged them to stockpile food, medicine, etc.,
and asked them to relay this message to their contacts. One of the messages that circulated,
allegedly sent by the Department of Homeland Security, stated that the government would
make its announcement as soon as troops were properly deployed to contain any riots.
Within 48 hours, the rumor had already become so widespread that the National
Security Council publicly denied the information via its Twitter account: “Text message
rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown.”1258 This was
a text message version of the traditional email chain: “not something that is new, but it is
something that is effective,” said Graham Brookie, director of the DFRLab at the Atlantic
Council.1259 According to U.S. intelligence, Chinese services contributed to this operation, not necessarily by creating the messages, but by amplifying them on social
networks and messaging apps, including encrypted messaging, a practice that make
identification and fighting against misinformation all the more difficult.1260

D. The PLA is also waging war through social networks
While attribution to the Chinese state is generally difficult, mainly because of so-called
“nationalist” or “patriotic trolling” which is not necessarily directed or controlled by the
state. It is even more challenging to know which agencies or departments within
the state are involved. Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga and Michael S. Chase estimated
that the accounts deleted by Twitter in August and September 2019 were operated by the
Propaganda Department and/or UFWD.1261 Attention is generally focused on the
UFWD, but the authors rightly believed that “the PLA should be recognized as another
key driver of these Chinese efforts. Recent events in Taiwan as well as writings and patents filed by Chinese military researchers suggest that the PLA is increasingly interested in
leveraging social media for such political interference in foreign countries, including in the

United States.”1262 While the main actors manipulating social media are undoubtedly
the PLA, the UFWD, and the MSS, there does not seem to be a clear division of labor
between them, or at least it remains unknown to us.
The PLA uses social networks for “open” influence first, i.e. circulating propaganda, for deterrence and psychological warfare; then, it uses them to conduct
clandestine and hostile operations against foreign targets. On the first point, the PLA
has its own vectors, notably the PLA Daily and the China Military Online website, and it
uses Chinese state media, notably Xinhua, China Daily, and the Global Times. It has also been
managing a large number of accounts on Chinese social networks (Weibo and WeChat)
since 2010 (the first of which was probably the PLA Daily’s Weibo account in March 2010).
It had 700 accounts in February 2017 and probably more today.1263 The PLA does not yet
have accounts on Western social networks (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram) however, where it is indirectly present, passing on its messages through other Chinese accounts,
especially news agencies. That said, it could join them soon.
Beauchamp-Mustafaga and Chase’s report gives valuable insights because it is based
on Chinese military literature (doctrine, articles published in the PLA Daily, the monthly
Military Correspondent, and other military newspapers). It thus provides a better grasp of
what military researchers think, especially when talking about the “war of public opinion
online” (网络舆论战), an effort to which we contributed with the analysis of different
PLA actors, in particular Base 311, in the second part of this report (→ p. 89).
Doctrinal documents insist on the importance of the informational field: a 2013
book on the Science of Military Strategy (战略学) published by the Department of World
Military Research of the Academy of Military Science (军事学学院战略研究部), stated
that “informational dominance is the foundation of the initiative on the battlefield”1264; and the 2015 Chinese White Paper on Defense spoke of the “informationization” of war.1265
Similarly to Russia, the information field is conceived in a broad sense: “the PLA
views cyber, electronic, and psychological warfare as interconnected subcomponents of
informational warfare writ large.”1266 Moreover, Chinese informational warfare, in general,
is probably coordinated by the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission (中央网络安全和
信息化委员会), chaired by Xi himself1267 – while at the PLA’s level, coordination probably
falls to the SSF (Strategic Support Force).
The PLA first focused on online media, which were quickly seen as power multipliers that could “double the results for half the effort when trying to mislead and confuse
people with information.”1268 Then, in 2009, the PLA became aware of the importance
of social networks in informational warfare, seeing how they were used by Western
powers to encourage the post-election uprisings in Iran. An article in that year’s China
Defense News talked about “cyber-subversion” and noted how, “through Twitter, Facebook,
YouTube and other websites, the US, Britain and Israeli intelligence have spread sensation1262. Ibid., viii-ix.

alist information to poison the Iranian people.”1269 In 2003 already, before the emergence
of social media, the PLA had been closely monitoring how the Americans used mass media
to shape public opinion about their intervention in Iraq. The PLA generally follows what
the Americans did in terms of influence, considering that they are “the best in the
world” in this domain.1270
From this point of view, it is crucial to understand that the Chinese posture – like
the Russian one – is primarily defensive: the threat that these methods could be used
to encourage revolts in China increased the latter government’s interest in mass media:
“[from] China’s perspective, influence operations are undertaken by all countries, and it is
other countries, especially the United States, that use social media to interfere in the political
processes of countries like Iran and the Middle East. Whatever actions the PLA takes to
counter this perceived subversion are considered ‘defensive’ and necessary to protect and
defend the military and the Party.”1271 It took them a few years only, however, to perceive their offensive potential.
Thus, in a 2011 article, PLA researchers presented the social networks’ potential as
a “subtle disguise” for psychological warfare or a “sugar-coated pill” as the target’s
psychology can be affected without their knowledge.1272 Here, disinformation (虚假 信
息) is a tool of psychological warfare. A 2013 book of the Academy of Military Sciences
explained that it could be used in various ways: “the deprivation of information, the creation of informational chaos […], the implantation of erroneous information into
the enemy’s information system, causing the enemy command to make the wrong
decisions.”1273 A 2006 article recommended “misleading” enemy leaders by “mixing
true and false information,” making them indistinguishable.1274
In 2015, the PLA Daily devoted a whole page to “Social Media Warfare,”1275 not only
from the point of view of China’s adversaries, and therefore of the risks that it poses
China’s stability, but also considering the opportunities it gives the PLA. This shows how
what was initially perceived as a vulnerability – therefore defensively – quickly became a
weapon as well, with the PLA now assessing its offensive uses.
According to Beauchamp-Mustafaga and Chase, the PLA has three main objectives
on social networks, the first two of which are open, the third clandestine: “First, it
seeks to achieve narrative dominance through the use of official social media accounts
to overtly spread Chinese propaganda and, thereby, shape public perceptions and policies toward China and its military. Second, the PLA seeks to use official social media
accounts for deterrence purposes to communicate deterrence signals, which specifically

demonstrate China’s capabilities and credibility while also undermining an enemy’s resolve
through psychological warfare. Third, the PLA seeks to leverage social media for political interference in order to degrade the credibility of a foreign political system, undermine support for a foreign government and its policies, as well as support China’s preferred
political candidates in an election.”1276
In this vein, several articles published in military journals suggested that “the PLA is
developing technologies to manipulate foreign social media platforms,”1277 including “deep fakes” and “public sentiment analysis.” A 2018 article from the PLA’s leading
psychological warfare unit advocated for more research and investment in digital information operations, particularly into the use of big data and automatic language processing.1278
Another proof of the PLA’s interest in the use of databases and artificial intelligence was the interest aroused by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In a 2018 article, a
professor at the National Defence University defended that “lessons [had to] be learned,”
particularly in terms of China’s ability to “exploit big data analysis, AI processes, bots
and astroturfing, grasp the different personalities of selectors1279 and realize largescale guidance of public opinion and changing their [political] orientation.”1280 The
author also emphasized “the value of tailoring messages based on the beliefs, value system, political orientation, and targeting of different countries, political parties, and cultural
groups, among others.”1281 All of this suggests that at least some PLA members are interested in “using social media and next-generation tools to influence voters in foreign
countries.”1282 Finally, a June 2019 article co-authored by a Base 311 researcher “explicitly
suggested that the PLA should use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manage its network
of social media bots, which would be able to create content based on human advice,
select the appropriate time to publish on social media and coordinate these fake (
马甲) accounts.”1283

E. Satire and irony
Chinese information-manipulation operations often use humor, particularly satire and irony, to amplify the scope of their message or to undermine the credibility of
their opponents.1284 We have provided several examples of this, notably taken from the CYL
during the scandal over George Floyd’s death (→ p. 387). The power of these rhetorical
tools was identified very early on by Greek and Roman orators. Because of its abil1276. Beauchamp-Mustafaga and Chase, Borrowing a Boat Out to Sea, 14.

ity to quickly turn a hostile opinion around,1285 the joke is almost a magical weapon that
every speaker must know how to handle. A witticism can, in a few seconds, convince an
initially reluctant audience. As Cicero and Quintilian showed, the strength of a joke is that
it allows one to play on the three methods of persuasion: docere, delectare, and mouere. Because
the joke can be the vector of an honest thought, including (and more importantly) the most
difficult to hear, it acts on docere (translation of the Greek logos that refers to the factual
and objective dimension of the discourse). It is notably in the form of the witty word that
the joke is the most effective in mobilizing this tool of persuasion. The joke is particularly
useful for the second method, delectare (translation of the Greek ethos), because it can build
complicity with the audience and attract sympathy with the speaker (conciliare). Finally, the
joke makes it possible to set in motion mouere (“to move”), such as throwing opprobrium
on the adversary by discrediting them with a scathing remark. Animalization or association
with unpleasant or ridiculous characters is also a proven method of positively moving and
engaging the audience.
In April 2020, Xinhua Agency posted a video on YouTube called “Once Upon a
Virus.” This 1-minute-46-second montage was a perfect illustration of the CCP’s
use of humor and satire in its propaganda operations. Featuring Lego characters participating in a play, the video was structured around a dialogue between China and the
United States about the Covid-19, the first represented by a group of Terracotta Warriors
and the second by the Statue of Liberty. The video explicitly stated that the health situation in the United States was due to the refusal of the authorities to listen to the warnings
that China issued. The comic tone was in the contrast between the words of the Statue of
Liberty (i.e., the United States), which insisted that forcing people to wear masks was contrary to human rights or accused China of building concentration camps, and the progressive deterioration of its health ostentatiously suggested by the image. While making people
smile, the message emphasized the absurdity of Washington’s narratives when Beijing was
seemingly simply trying to alert Americans to the risks they were taking with this attitude.
The use of Lego, by association of ideas, reinforced the demonstration of the infantile
character of the U.S. posture.

The CCP’s use of satire also takes the form of hijacking Western fables and folk
tales. Two recent illustrations are very evocative: on May 12, 2021, Xinhua broadcast, via
Western social networks, a criticism of what the media presented as the hegemonic posture
of the United States. To do this, Xinhua created an analogy between Washington’s attitude
and that of the stepmother in the Grimm brothers’ fairy tale, Snow White.

In Xinhua’s cartoon story, the Statue of Liberty, symbolizing the United States, asks
her magic mirror if the U.S. order dominates the world, and when it answers in the negative, the statue breaks it. The idea conveyed is that the United States cannot stand any
competition and is not ready to hear the truth, in other words that the world is no longer
subjected to them. We understand implicitly that this world is opening its arms to China,
which is proposing a new international order. The second example, already cited in the
section on the “wolf warrior” diplomats (→ p. 243), dates from March 31, 2021, when
the Chinese embassy in Ireland hijacked Aesop’s fable, retold by La Fontaine, The Wolf
and the Lamb, on Twitter. The message was ambiguous: on the one hand, the embassy
seemed to be saying that it was innocent of accusations bearing on the so-called wolf warrior diplomacy, and thus a victim, like the lamb in the fable; but on the other hand it ended
its message with a threat, explaining that China was not a lamb. The country would not let
itself be “devoured.” In both cases, the instrumentalization of Western popular culture is a
process that allows China to develop a critique of the United States in a metaphorical and
amusing way. Without being too ferocious, the criticism creates suggestive images that are
likely to be imprinted on the public mind.

F. Doxxing, or inciting hatred online
Doxxing is the practice of “publishing a user’s personal information online with
the aim of harming them.”1286 From online harassment to physical attacks, cyber-attacks,
death threats, pressure on family and friends, etc., the consequences can be severe. It was
used mainly against pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, first during the 2014 crisis and then again in 2019. By September 2019, this phenomenon had reached an “unprecedented” level on forums such as LIHKG and messaging services such as Telegram, so
much so that Hong Kong’s privacy commission had identified nearly 1,000 cases that were
likely to be investigated and prosecuted.1287

Screenshot of the HKLeaks website on 03/14/2021.

The best-known website in this register is HKLeaks, which was initially registered on
hkleaks.org on August 15, 2019, and which was on as hkleaks.pk and hkleaks.ml when this
report was written. Among the “targets” profiled on this website were “eight teachers that
are seen as supporters of the protests (including the director of the Chinese University of
Hong Kong), 61 journalists and editors of Apple Daily (one of Hong Kong’s biggest newspapers), 23 individuals who allegedly ‘doxxed’ the Hong Kong police, numerous pro-democracy lawmakers and opinion leaders, and more than 900 protesters.”1288 These profiles
were then shared on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, and Weibo).
Several signs suggest that Chinese authorities were behind this initiative or at least
supported it. Not only did the very professional nature of the website seemed to suggest a
level of financial resources and expertise, but the accounts promoting it on social networks
were the same that several platforms removed for “coordinated inauthentic behavior linked
to state-backed actors.” Moreover, state media were promoting HKLeaks (CCTV’s Weibo
account featured HKLeaks asking its followers to “act together” and “tear off the masks of
the rioters,” a message later shared by Chinese police and the CYL, among others).1289 Most
importantly, information that only Chinese authorities knew was contained in the profiles
of the targeted individuals, such as a false address that was given to the Chinese police or a
passport photo that was only used on a travel permit to China.1290
Another doxing website, hongkongmob.com, paid users who provided new targets or new information about existing targets. In January 2020, the website, which
has since been discontinued, reported that it had doxxed 62 protesters and distributed
HKD78,019 (€8,273) in rewards.1291 Insikt Group (Recorded Future) believed that the
actors behind this website “are likely not Hong Kong natives, but are attempting to pass
off as such. Although most of the website is written in traditional Chinese characters […]

and the content mirrors written and spoken Cantonese […], some terms and wording used
on the website are not commonly used by Hong Kong-born Cantonese speakers.”1292
Insikt Group also noted that the two websites, hkleaks.pk and hongkongmob.com (the
second website is no longer online) were hosted in Russia, by the same company (DDoSGUARD), with a partly similar IP address (185.178.208.149 and 185.178.208.143 other)
and they used the same Russian e-mail service (Yandex).1293

G. Language as a clue to the Chinese origin of the manipulations
A priori, Beijing can easily penetrate Chinese-speaking environments, such as Hong
Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, or even English-speaking environments, such as Singapore,
Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada – even if local variations can make
it more difficult. On the other hand, countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and especially
Japan feel relatively protected by the language barrier since few Chinese have a perfect
command of their national languages. However, this seems to be less and less the case.
Three years ago, Chinese informational attacks on Japan contained syntax errors in
Japanese or characters that were only used in China and that were therefore easily
spotted. But Chinese services have improved in recent years: “APT10’s emails are now
very good, their Japanese is excellent, not distinguishable.”1294
In Hong Kong and Taiwan, the difference between the traditional Chinese widely
spoken and the simplified Chinese from mainland China remains the principal way
to detect the origin of a message, but with several limitations. First, it is not obvious
for Taiwanese to spot suspicious simplified Chinese characters because, in their daily life,
Taiwanese people are constantly exposed to simplified Chinese on television, in the subtitling of TV series, on social networks, or in many cultural products. Eventually, they do
not notice it anymore, and when they do, it is not necessarily perceived as something suspicious.1295 Second, simplified Chinese is found in articles from continental media shared
by Taiwanese on social networks, without being a symptom of any Chinese clandestine
operation. The use of simplified Chinese can also be explained by an assumed strategy of
targeting different audiences: in this case, the parts of the population favorable to Beijing.
Part of the public is aware that these messages come from China. However, it still works
because they do not care whether they are authentic or manipulated as long as these messages say what they want to hear, comfort them in their certainties – a well-known psychological phenomenon that helps explain the persistence of information manipulation despite
corrections, warnings and other demystifications.
Attackers attempt to conceal their continental origin by translating simplified
Chinese into traditional Chinese. However, this can be detected in long texts, into
which a few simplified characters may slip by mistake. In the disinformation about the
pandemic, for example, one of the terms that revealed the Chinese origin of the messages
was “corpse,” which is written 屍體 in traditional characters (in Taiwan) but 尸体 in simplified characters (in the PRC). However, many messages wrote 尸體, correctly converting the

second character, but not the first, thus revealing their continental inception.1296 Another
clue is that the change of language on Microsoft leaves some traces (in the way the
characters are presented) so that it is still possible to determine that a text in traditional
Chinese came from a computer usually running in simplified Chinese. It is also possible to
identify expressions used exclusively in mainland China (such as “Taiwanese authority” rather than Taiwan).
Aware of these difficulties, attackers have refined their methods and are increasingly using Taiwanese intermediaries: messages are either produced locally or in
China and then sent to relays that “Taiwanize” them before disseminating them.
These relays can be public relations agencies in Taiwan or Taiwanese living in mainland
China. In 2017, a student at the PLA National Defence University created a manual to
help the PLA “relocalize” and thus better conceal its social network interventions into
Taiwan: “[the] author explains how to alter the sentence structure and vocabulary used
by Mandarin speakers […] to sound more like that of Southern Min, the language used
in Taiwan, because he is from Fujian, where the local dialect is closest to Taiwanese. He
[explains] that sounding local will reduce the emotional distance between the two sides.”1297
“Since 2018, one minister explained, we have noted that simplified characters are
making themselves rare: China subcontracts to groups located in Taiwan and uses
local expressions.”1298 J. Michael Cole corroborated this information: “At first, they were
using Chinese citizens, but the audience quickly realized it because they were using simplified Chinese and phrases. […] Now, he said, the content appears to be produced in
Taiwan.”1299 This method is more interesting than the previous ones because it goes beyond
simple translation, as the Taiwanese interpreter can insert cultural references in the content.
It is nothing less than cultural intermediation. If the Chinese sponsor correctly erases its
traces, the message disseminated is therefore much harder to attribute.
Language remains a relevant clue, but to a lesser extent, and the foreseeable use of
artificial intelligence to generate false news will probably further reduce the importance of the language factor. Another problem is that the importance of words needs to be
put into perspective: a significant proportion of information manipulation involves images,
memes, or a few messages that are too short to leave an indication of the language of origin.
At least three other clues must be considered: first, the timing. The Taiwanese have
found that during Golden Week (annual vacations in mainland China), there was a decrease
in misinformation targeting Taiwan, suggesting that some does come from mainland China.
Second, recycling; some of the false news that targeted the DPP during the last electoral
campaign was obviously repurposed from Hong Kong to Taiwan (producing a Taiwanese
version of the same false story → p. 485). Third, the themes: some attacks have cultural
markers. For example, the CCP is characterized by its tendency to think in ethnic terms: having foreign ancestors, whether true or not (a false rumor that Joshua Wong was Vietnamese
for instance), is not a problem in a multicultural society like Taiwan and reveals a perspective
from mainland China. So, attacks on Taiwanese using these representations, like the Japanese
name of the president’s spokesperson, Kolas Yotaka, are culturally signed.

X. Other levers
In this non-exhaustive list of other tools of leverage used in Chinese influence operations, we also need to add citizen movements, Chinese tourists, influencers and hostages.

A. Citizen movements
1. Pro-independence movements: New Caledonia and Okinawa
Encouraging independence movements fits Beijing’s agenda as it seeks to regain
market shares and make potential adversaries more fragile, two non-mutually exclusive goals that can be found in these two examples.
First: New Caledonia. There were suspicions of Chinese interference in the 2018 referendum on the independence of New Caledonia,1300 and Beijing is known to be closely following
the progress of the pro-independence camp – something confirmed by the 2020 referendum –
precisely because an independent New Caledonia would de facto find itself under Chinese
influence. This would bring two key benefits for the Party-State. First, China would be able to
rely on New Caledonia to “become the cornerstone of the Chinese anti-encirclement strategy,”
while at the same time isolating Australia “since, in addition to relying on Noumea, Beijing would
be able to rely on Port Moresby, Honiara, Port-Vila and Suva.”1301 It would also ensure a supply of
raw materials, i.e. nickel, to China. So, there are several reasons why Beijing pushes for independence while maintaining relationships with the local political and economic elite. “China moves
forward by gaining control of the economy from within, by getting closer to political and
tribal leaders, because that is the most efficient and discrete method. China’s strategy is perfectly
well-oiled and has worked elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.”1302
The Association de l’amitié sino-calédonienne [Sino-Caledonian Friendship
Association] plays such a role, carrying out a United Front work locally.1303 We
should note that its former president, Karine Shan Sei Fan, is also the former chief
of staff of the pro-independence leader1304 “whose previous two chiefs of staff are
valued members” of the association.1305 Generally, the Chinese “diaspora and its
representative organizations, at least some of them, are extremely close to some
pro-independence officials.”1306 Karine Shan Sei Fan invited the Chinese ambassador
to France on the island in October 2017, a year before the referendum. The ambassador spent the week there with his spouse and some advisers: “they saw everybody, they

asked what we needed: tourism, aquaculture, anything that could be of interest, they
would offer it,” parliament member Philippe Gomès remembers.1307
Okinawa is another example. Japan has a strong national identity, even a sense of insularity (→ p. 191). But Okinawa – as well as the entirety of the Ryukyu Islands – is an exception
because its inhabitants were abused by the Japanese during the Second World War. The population is divided on the subject of Japan. Pro-Chinese feelings are then widespread and
sustained by the fact that inhabitants benefit from trading with China. For Beijing, this is a
weakness that can be exploited, and a strategic opportunity: their location ensures an access to
the second chain of Pacific Islands. With these islands, they kill two birds with one stone,
by hindering both the Japanese and the Americans who are present there.
Okinawa is a fertile ground for such operations because indigenous pro-independence movements, who are also hostile to the presence of an American base on the
island, already exist. The majority of the island is anti-Tokyo and anti-central government, as
evidenced in the election of Denny Tamaki as governor (a longtime opponent to the American
presence), in October 2018. The Okinawa prefecture hence advocates for the departure of some
of the troops (navy and air forces). The risk of Okinawa unilaterally declaring its independence
in the future is taken seriously by Tokyo. At the same time, “China encourages this objective
through diplomacy, disinformation, and investments in the northern part of the island
near the U.S. bases.”1308
In 2013, the Global Times already warned about Beijing potentially “fostering forces
that seek the restoration of the independence of the Ryukyu Chain in Okinawa,” and,
in doing so, “threatening the country’s integrity,” as it tries to defend China against the
US-Japan alliance.1309 Beijing did just that. In December 2016, the Japanese Public Security
Intelligence Agency (PSIA) revealed that Chinese universities and think tanks were trying to foster connections with pro-independence activists in Okinawa. Meanwhile, the Chinese press
regularly publishes articles questioning Japan’s sovereignty on Okinawa. According to Professor
Yuichi Hosoya, Beijing is “influencing Okinawan public opinion to push for Okinawan
independence and the removal of U.S. forces.”1310
“There are also increasing economic ties between China and Okinawa: Chinese investors are
engaged in the northern areas of Okinawa, which are rich in natural resources and populated by U.S.
military facilities. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in the number of Chinese tourists in Okinawa in recent years, as well as an increasing number of sister-city relationships formed
between Chinese cities and Okinawa. The PRC government has also actively courted members of
the former Okinawan royal family. In 2018, Shō Masamu, the great grandson of the last Ryukyu
king, visited China. In March of that year, Masamu led a 22-member delegation to visit Fujian for a
four-day ‘root-seeking’ tour [while at the same time a conference] was organized to explore the historical ties between Okinawa and China.”1311 Beijing also develops relationships between Chinese
researchers, think tanks (the Academy of Social Science) and pro-independence activists:
they invite them to China to improve their image and provide a platform to them.
There also is a convergence between, on the one hand, independists and those opposed
to the U.S. presence in Okinawa and, on the other hand, leftist and pacifist activists, who
oppose the revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution (renouncing war) and the rein1307. Thibault, “China is Eyeing New Caledonia and its Nickel Reserves.”

forcement of Japanese self-defense capabilities. Beijing thus supports these movements as
well, which fits neatly with China’s agenda by impeding and inhibiting Japanese military developments. This is particularly the case for the Buddhist group Soka Gakkai, and its
political party Komeito, which are working toward a Sino-Japanese rapprochement. As a result,
it is for example commonplace to see Japanese left)wing activists and pacifists share Chinese
articles against the U.S. base in Okinawa.

2. Pacifist movements: the example of the group No Cold War
The CCP put together a support group that blames
U.S. actions, its interpretation of the “wolf warrior”
diplomacy, and the establishment of a new Cold
War era.1312 Among the first signatories where: Dianne
Abbott, Max Blumenthal, Barbara Finamore, Martin
Jacques, Wang Wen, Ken Loach, and Yanis Varoufakis.
We find not only anti-American organizations in this list,
but also front organizations in the Soviet sense, in
other words intermediaries working for Beijing. The
movement adopted a logo symbolically re-interpreting the U.S. flag to better highlight U.S.
aggressiveness and warmongering. The No Cold War inaugural conference was a conference
with 48 academics from a number of countries organized on July 25, 2020 to speak out
against the risk of a cold war imposed by the United States on the rest of humanity. Chinese
diplomatic authorities quickly spread the word about the event.

YouTube, and viewed by 200 million people, according to the Chongyang Institute. The
institute also published screenshots of public comments. Several Chinese state media, such
as the China Daily, CCTV, China News Network, Guancha, reported on the event the following day. CYL outlets were also very active, and multiples messages were shared on WeChat.
The Global Times launched a thread called “48 academics warn the United States” (#48国
学者警告美国) that generated more than 82 million views. Hua Chunying put herself forward as the spokesperson for this movement, which she painted as a transnational movement against U.S. policies, using quotes from John Ross, a researcher at Renmin University
(→ p. 48). Ross actually relayed an open letter on Twitter and on the website of No Cold
War that denounced Ofcom’s decision to withdraw CGTN’s broadcasting rights in the
United Kingdom (Ofcom is the British telecommunication regulatory agency).1315 These
initiatives show that the CCP has probably increased its coordination capacities for this
kind of operation, a new development that would deserve further and more in-depth investigations.

The CCP’s narrative strategy consists in highlighting over and over the bellicosity
of the United States and the consequences of its policies on the rest of humanity.
The goal of this strategy is undoubtedly to turn the international public opinion against
Washington, by making it responsible for the tensions. Bill Bishop noted in Sinocism that
Beijing seems to be ready for a rupture and wishes to control how it will be narrated. This
concomitant evidence suggests that Beijing does not intend to reverse its course from
this Machiavellian turn (→ p. 619). In fact, the anti-cold war movement was not founded
on a unique event, but instead seems to be here for the long haul. Other mobilization drives
have already been announced. The narratives circulated by No Cold War are also endorsed
by other movements and members of political parties. Diane Abbott, for instance, a Labour
member who signed the first petition launched by No Cold War, participated in a conference on the threat of a new cold war organized by the Stop the War coalition, along with
other Labour members (see images above).

B. Chinese tourists
Chinese tourists have been the sector’s biggest market since 2012, because they
are the most numerous, the biggest spenders, and because this is a fast-growing market.1316 Controlling the number of tourists is an important leverage for Beijing to pressure some foreign governments. This weapon has been used in Taiwan (→ p. 453) and in
Australia, where Chinese tourism increased by 297% between 2009 and 2019, as reported by
Global Times. The newspaper added that this number could drastically decrease in 2020, not
only because of the pandemic, but also because the Chinese Ministry for Culture published
a warning advising against traveling to Australia because of the “racial discrimination” and
“violence” against Chinese people that it claimed to have witnessed1317. In reality, both tourists and trade sanctions are part of the leverage used by Beijing in its standoff with Canberra
(→ p. 246).1318 This weapon was also used against Sweden (→ p. 528), South Korea (where the
decreased number of Chinese tourists was one of the retaliatory measures implemented by
Beijing against the deployment of the anti-ballistic missile defense system THAAD) and others. It was identified as an important vulnerability in a lot of countries, including Japan, which
is quite dependent on Chinese tourists (they make up around 30% of the overall number of
tourists and 34% of the money spent by foreign tourists).1319
In addition to controlling the number of tourists, Beijing can also use them to
circulate messages, as seen in Vietnam. Chinese tourists in Vietnam – there are more
than 4 million of them every year, more than 30% the total number of tourists – are usually
badly perceived. In May 2018, some of them led provocative actions: they landed in the
Cam Ranh airport, in the south of the country, wearing T-shirts displaying the South
China Sea and the nine-dash line, a delineation contested by China’s neighbors, including Vietnam. In fact, the delineation was rejected by the Permanent court of Arbitration in
The Hague in 2016. The images triggered strong reactions, both in the airport and on social
media, many Internet users calling for their expulsion from the territory.

The same nine-dash line can be found on a page of the Chinese passport that, for this
reason, some agents at the Vietnamese border frequently refuse to stamp.1320 Chinese tourists are also criticized for bringing their own touristic guides, who are accused of rewriting
history (and maritime law), thus provoking opposition from local tourist guides.
Since 2013, China has also been using tourism as a leverage to strengthen its
claims in the South China Sea. Two Chinese companies, the Hainan Strait Shipping
Co Ltd (HNSS) and the Nanhai Cruse Entreprise (NHC) offer cruises in the Paracel
Islands, also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam. Since then, more than 10,000 Chinese tourists paid between RMB4,280 and RMB29,300 per person (€550 and €3,800) for the trip.1321
Beyond economic issues, the development of these activities fits within a wider policy of
integration of the South China territories to the Chinese area. When the town of Sanya, in
the south of the Hainan Island, became a prefecture in 2012, to administer the entirety of
the territories inside the nine-dash lines, the same political message was being conveyed:
these territories are Chinese.
The government overtly recognizes the political significance of these touristic activities.
According to Wang Zhifa, former director of China’s National Tourism Administration,
“developing Xisha [Paracel islands] tourism can be conducive to defending the border,
declaring our sovereignty, and solving the problems of other islands in the South China
Sea.”1322 As noted by Yan Huang and Samid Suliman, tourism is indeed perceived by Beijing
as a tool to reinforce the legitimacy of its claims on this area. The presence of Chinese
tourism proves, in the eyes of the Party, that China has been managing this area regularly,
which in return legitimates China’s rights over these territories. This tourism also allows the
construction of the Chinese population’s “territorial consciousness.”1323 Cruses are
indeed deploying all available tools to favor the emergence and consolidation of patriotic feelings toward South China Sea islands. Tourists were invited to watch a 1976
movie, The Story of the South China Sea, recounting the events of the Vietnam War, and had
to pledge to love the Paracel Islands and China.1324 Finally, the development of tourism in
the area is an undeniable tool to apply pressure on its neighbors, some of which have
also started to develop touristic activities. Beijing also wishes to extend touristic activities in
the South China Sea to the Spratly Islands farther to the south.

For various reasons – because they are forced, bought or simply seduced – many foreigners act as relays or vectors of Chinese influence in the world. Beijing particularly appreciates those of them who are Westerners, since they come from the opposite camp. “It
is a strategy of envelopment, using as levers a priori contrary currents to give the
illusion of unanimity around Chinese positions,” explained Emmanuel Lincot.1325 The

preceding pages have already given numerous examples of this, of different calibers, more
or less aware of being instrumentalized and more or less useful to the regime (which is why
not all of them fall into the Soviet category of “useful idiots”). This section will present
two additional categories of influencers particularly sought after by the CCP: YouTubers
and academics.

1. YouTubers
The Canadian YouTuber J.J. McCullough (→ p. 375) is a good case of a Westerner used
to hide the origin of a message, because in this case not only did a person by the name
of “Franco” (a non-Chinese name) tried to release a video via the Canadian YouTuber, but
the video itself, while being Chinese propaganda, was also narrated by a Western individual.
Among other examples of YouTubers relaying Chinese propaganda, the most
famous is undoubtedly Nathan Rich, an American living in China, followed by half a million subscribers,1326 who holds pro-Beijing and virulent anti-American views. He is particularly involved in defending Beijing’s action in Hong Kong. Many other YouTubers in China
are convinced that he is “paid to publish propaganda, either by the CCP, or by agents in the
name of the CCP.”1327 Can also be added to the list Barrett, a British father-and-son duo
living in China (268,000 followers),1328 also very aggressive in their defense of the Chinese
regime, as shown by the titles of their videos (“Western media lies about China”, “Camera
surveillance is great in China”); Jason Lightfoot (120,000 subscribers),1329 another British
citizen who has been living in China for about ten years, and who record videos on Xinjiang
have been widely relayed by the Chinese authorities (below); or Gweilo60 (85,000 subscribers),1330 a retired Canadian married to a Chinese woman and living in China. Of course the
question arises of their motives, which can be diverse: have they been forced to do it,
bought, or simply seduced?
Whatever their motives may be, some of them have led full-fledged harassment
campaigns against YouTubers who criticized the Chinese regime. SerpentZA and
laowhy86 (→ p. 375) who were initially mostly neutral, have gradually become critical of
the Chinese regime, and have incidentally become the targets of hate and harassment campaigns on YouTube (including from other YouTubers, particularly the Barretts) and on
other social media. For instance, they were denounced on a website set up in 2019 by the
government to allow Chinese to denounce “foreign spies.”1331 And the pressure exerted
by authorities has increased: monthly police inspections of their homes, their spouses and
their children were harassed – including SerpenZA’s family in South Africa (trolls even
attacked people in South Africa who merely had the same last name). They were branded
as racists paid by “the West” or by the CIA, and so on.

Foreign academics are additional levers at the Party’s disposal. We already mentioned several researchers who defended Chinese positions or promoted Party narratives.
An operation of seduction usually starts with an invitation to China, all expenses paid.
Laurent Grosclaude, the former vice-president for international relations of the University
of Toulouse I-Capitole, testified that “the Chinese artfully flatter our ego.” First-class plane
tickets, nice hotel, a driver… “Sometimes, a Mercedes came to pick me at the hotel to bring
me to my meeting with the president of a university. It gave me the feeling that I was a minister.”1334 Not everyone falls for it however. Moreover, the foreign academics that become
relays for the CCP have various motivations. We can distinguish three main categories:
the opportunists, who do not necessarily share Beijing’s views and are simply looking
for (in kind or symbolic) benefits; those for whom China is a simple rhetorical instrument to denounce the United States, Beijing taking on what used to be the USSR’s role
during the Cold War; finally, those who develop an apologetic pro-Chinese discourse
out of conviction. We must immediately note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, some academics being both admirers of the Chinese model and anti-American. This
is likely the case for Martin Jacques, who seems to see a viable form of Marxist-Leninism
in the Chinese system, while clearly showing his anti-American views.1335
Among those defending the Chinese model, Daniel Bell deserves to be introduced. A
Canadian national, Daniel Bell is dean of the Department of Political Science and Public
Administration at Shandong University. He also teaches at the University of Tsinghua in
Beijing. He has published many books and articles painting the Chinese political
system as a model for the West.1336 He found the possibility of a Chinese humanism,
and even a solution to the crisis of liberal democracies, in the Confucian renewal running
through the Chinese society since the 1990s. In his opinion, representative democracies

suffer from two main ills: on the national scale, they make it structurally impossible for
elected officials to take into account the interests of future generations or of the rest of the
world; and then, insofar as they base their policies on the erratic decisions of voters, they
are condemned to be inefficient. In that regard, Bell picked up on Bryan Caplan’s thesis on
the irrationality of homo politicus.1337
Bell suggests adopting the Chinese system as a way forward, with the selection of
officials through meritocratic contests. These contests, he argued, are the only one able to
produce wise leaders, the idea being that leaders will be better able to take rational decision
that take into account the next generations and global issues when they are not constrained
by elections. He believes that such a system wouldn’t be authoritarian, but simply more
efficient. If this report does not intend to discuss Bell’s theories, we should note that his
hypothesis ignores the fundamental question of the consent to be governed, and clumsily
avoids to discuss the nature of the authority vested with the power to select the wisest
leaders.1338
In any case, these stances taken by Westerners largely serve the CCP’s interests, which
sees its authoritarian model presented as superior to the liberal democratic model and, as
such, legitimized by outsiders. Hence, the CCP benefits from encouraging these academics
to speak out, as they contribute to the diffusion of a positive image of the Chinese regime.
Besides, these intellectuals, who are often active in public debates, offer a possibility for the
Party to externalize the fight against its critics, in conformity with the strategy of the United
Front.

The case of Dean Mestre (France)
On February 25, 2021, Jérémy André, the correspondent of the French weekly Le Point, published an article untitled “How China pushes its pawns in universities,”1339 which highlighted
a problem to which other countries had been cognizant for years (Australia first, followed
by Canada and the United States) but that had remained under the radar in France. This
was a symptom of what we call the “French Awakening” in the conclusion of the report
(→ p. 640). This article opened with the example of Christian Mestre. While he was the
honorary dean of Strasbourg’s Faculty of Law, Mestre travelled to Urumqi (capital of the
Xinjiang) in September 2019 to participate in an “International Seminar on Counter-terrorism,
De-radicalization and Human Rights Protection” during which, according to Chinese state
media, he declared that he had “found that efficient measures had been taken in the region
against terrorism and extremism, and that these measures had improved the socio-economic development of the region.”1340 He subsequently shared his hope that “France and other
European countries could adopt the solutions used in Xinjiang,” adding that “these people are
not sent to jail but to compulsory training.” His colleague Thomas Boutonnet, director of the
Department of China studies at the University of Strasbourg, believed that “this is no longer
sheer naivety, it amounts to a negationist stance.”
Several years before, in May 2013, the same Christian Mestre had “proposed to install a
Confucius Institute in his [law] department,” to the dismay of his China Studies colleagues who

found it surprising that Mestre, an expert on European Law, started to “champion Beijing
at the University.” In September 2014, “following a demand of the General Consulate of
China in Strasbourg,” the Faculty of Law hosted a series of events on Tibet, including “an
inaugural conference which defended that Tibet had never be annexed, and that the 1950
Chinese intervention had been demanded by the Tibetans.” In 2015, responding to an initiative
of the Chinese Society for the Study of Human Rights, a pseudo-NGO (GONGO → p. 220),
whose executives are members of the Propaganda Department and other CCP agencies,1341
Mestre “co-organized a China-Europe forum on human rights at the European Court of
Human Rights” – which was nothing less than “a whitewashing operation at the heart of
European institutions.” Since at least 2018, he has been an adjunct professor at the Southwest
University of Political Science and Law, in Chongqing, China.1342 In 2020, Lu Rucai, the French
editor-in-chief of La Chine au present (French version of China Daily), a monthly magazine of
the CCP Propaganda Department, invited Mestre to join the committee of experts of the new
magazine Dialogue Chine-France (→ p. 341).1343
Finally, in December 2020, he was appointed ethics officer to the Strasbourg Eurometropolis, “a
key position to assess conflicts of interest knowing that Alsace will soon host a Huawei mega-factory and debates the implementation of the 5G.” According to Jérémy André, “the very fact that
Christian Mestre teaches at Changqing University puts him in a conflict of interest in a region
that welcomes very important Chinese investments. Remunerated by the Chinese state, he
was in no position to [conveniently] scrutinize whether elected officials were receiving money or
exercising activities that tied them to Chinese investors.”1344 MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, president
of the Special Commission for Foreign Interference, also reacted to his appointment: “this cocktail
of cynicism and naivety creates legitimate problems for the national security and the sovereignty
of democratic institutions. If the elite sells itself to China and mandarins turn themselves
into lobbyists, whitewash the largest mass internment of our time, this shows that there
is a grave ethical problem among the French elite.” One day after the revelations of Le Point,
Christian Mestre resigned from his position as ethics officer for the Strasbourg Eurometropolis.1345

The case of Professor Lange (Germany)
From influence to espionage, there is only one step, as illustrated by the case of Klaus Lange, a
German political scientist specialized in international relations, who for 50 years, and in
parallel to his academic career, was also an agent of the German Federal Intelligence Service
(BND), which he informed in particular on Asian issues. But in 2010, on the occasion of a lecture
he gave at Tongji University in Shanghai, he was recruited by the Chinese services (the MSS).
They seem to be interested in him at first to obtain information on Uyghurs, knowing that the
World Uyghur Congress is based in Germany, in Munich, and because Klaus Lange had directed
a publication on Islamist terrorism four years earlier for which he had entrusted a chapter to a
Chinese colonel, deputy defense attaché of the PRC in Berlin.1346 As founder and director of the
German think tank Institute for Transnational Studies (ITS) and senior consultant for the Hanns
Seidel Stiftung, a political foundation named after the co-founder of the CSU (Christian Social
Union) party in Bavaria, he was particularly well placed and politically connected to be useful
to Beijing. His wife, Klara Knapp, deputy director of the ITS, was recruited at the same time.
Initially, in 2010, Lange had informed the BND of the Chinese approach, and the German
service had agreed that he should continue the relationship, in order to learn more about what

they were looking for. But gradually, Lange reported less to the BND, which “was not aware
of the deepening [of his] contacts with the Chinese.”1347 This is precisely what he is accused of
today. Arrested a first time in November 2019 “when the couple was about to fly to Macau, to
meet their Chinese secret service officer,” Lange was imprisoned, released, and then arrested again in July 2021. The Karlsruhe public prosecutor’s office accuses him of “intelligence
activities for the benefit of a foreign power.”1348
The investigation could have a bilateral cooperation component, and investigations could lead
to South Tyrol because of the nationality of his wife, Klara Knapp, who comes from the village of Gais (Italy). The investigation will have to determine when Klaus Lange crossed a red
line, first by taking on more and more autonomy vis-à-vis the BND, and then what was the
nature of the information transmitted. At this stage, little information has been released
on this point. It is likely that Lange did not pass on sensitive information about internal BND
files (to which, as an honorable correspondent, he did not have access), but rather that he put
his political expertise on Asia, on the German political landscape on the positions of these
countries on China, and of course his very extensive address book, at Beijing’s service. He was,
however, a close associate of Volker Foertsch (with whom he co-edited the aforementioned
2006 publication), who for years headed the BND’s China department: through him, he could
therefore have had knowledge of the service’s operations in China.
His dense network of contacts, especially within the Uyghur and Tibetan diasporas (he organized
a summit between ministers and representatives of the Tibetan parliament in exile in Dharamsala
in 2009), legitimized by his functions as a political science researcher, allowed him to collect valuable data in terms of political intelligence. The fact that he had risen through the ranks of the
Hanns Seidel Stiftung (director of the Security Studies Department) gave him an inside view on
Bavarian decision-makers and security issues. Bavaria is particularly targeted by China, and
its CSU leaders are particularly accommodating given the weight of Chinese economic and scientific interests in the state. His regular travels and his exchanges with the director of the Russian
Academy of Sciences, the Pakistani ambassador and numerous think tanks around the world,
made him an attractive target for a foreign intelligence service.
Money does not appear to have been Lange’s primary motivation: investigators have found evidence of only one payment. Rewards appear to have taken the form of all-expenses paid trips
and “support programs.”1349

D. Hostages
China practices “hostage diplomacy” (such as Iran, Turkey, and North Korea), and it
was confirmed by the release of the “two Canadian Michaels”1350 (→ p. 546) only hours
after Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who had been under house arrest in Canada, was allowed
to return to China on September 25, 2021. Arrested in China shortly after she was arrested
in Canada at the request of the United States in late 2018, the transactional nature of this
exchange was clear from the beginning: “It was give and take: Meng against the two
Michaels.”1351 By releasing them the same day, Beijing was fully assuming this hostage diplomacy and sending a message to the rest of the world. In fact, the Party-State has been developing this practice for years. The best-known case, apart from the “two Canadian Michaels,” is
that of the Swedish citizen Gui Minhai (→ p. 527), Yet, Beijing also took Australian citizens

as hostages, including writer Yang Jun (known as Yang Hengjun) and the TV anchor Cheng
Lei. An Australian citizen of Chinese origin, she was working for CGTN when she suddenly
disappeared in August 2020. Locked up in a prison in Beijing, she had no access to a lawyer
and was not allowed to talk on the phone to her two children, aged 11 and 9, who lived in
Melbourne. In February 2021, Chinese authorities revealed that she was accused of “illegally
supplying state secrets overseas,” without more details. Since then, a series of anonymous
messages on WeChat have rewritten her biography and disseminated elements supporting this
thesis – messages “written by Ministry of State Security (MSS) people to set the public tone,”
according to Feng Chongyi, an academic who had himself been detained in China four years
earlier. A hypothesis reinforced by the fact that one of the first articles incriminating Cheng
Lei came from the WeChat account that had also been the first to spread false information
about Vicky Xu (→ p. 167), another CCP target – an anonymous account presumably operated by Chinese services.1352 Another case of an Australian citizen of Chinese origin arbitrarily
arrested in China is that of researcher and writer Yang Hengjun, detained since 2019, also for
“espionage,” in reality for being the author of writings critical of the regime.1353
Some Japanese citizens have also been arrested. Recently, a professor of Chinese History
at Hokkaido University, Nobu Iwatani, was arrested on spying charges while in Beijing for a
conference to which he had been invited by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The
Academy booked the hotel Iwatani was staying at, which was searched by MSS agents who
then claimed to have found “illicit” publications in his room (books and newspapers on the
1937-45 Sino-Japanese War that he had bought second-hand from a Beijing bookseller). He
was detained in Beijing from the beginning of September 2019 to November 15. Before
him, and since 2015, thirteen other Japanese visitors had been arrested in China for spying,
nine of whom are still detained today.1354
The case of Taiwan has been less discussed because it is less publicized internationally.
It does not theoretically fit the hostage “diplomacy” since – from Beijing’s point of view –
Taiwan is not a foreign state with which they have diplomatic relations. But there is indeed an
established practice of kidnapping Taiwanese people, one of the means to pressure
the island. Some examples are known: Lee Ming-Che, a Taiwanese human rights activist and
former DPP member, was arrested in March 2017 as he entered continental China though
Macao. Charged with subversion – probably because he was exchanging on WeChat with
Chinese friends about the Taiwanese democracy – he was sentenced to five years in prison
in November 2017.1355 Tsai Chin-shu, a Taiwanese academic, was arrested in July 2018 and
detained in a jail near Fujian.1356 His case is interesting because he is on the “blue” side –
pro-unification – and supported former President Ma, contrary to the other two, who were
clearly “green.” Morrison Meng-chu Lee, another Taiwanese citizen, was arrested when he
entered China in September 2019 after participating in pro-democracy protests in HongKong.1357 But there could be many more cases that we do not know of.

SUMMARY OF THE THIRD PART

The actions carried out by Beijing as part of its influence operations abroad fulfill two
non-mutually exclusive goals:
• On the one hand, to seduce and subjugate foreign audiences by painting China in
a positive light. Four key narratives testify to this goal: the “Chinese model” (a spectacular
economic growth, an alleged administrative efficiency and a political regime superior to liberal
democracy); tradition, illustrated by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); benevolence, to demonetize the “Chinese threat” that constrains the implementation of the Party’s foreign policy
(and to which is then opposed the theory of the “peaceful emergence”); and power, which has
become China’s main appeal in the past two decades. It is embodied in its military might but
also in architectural, scientific and technological achievements, as well as in the organization of
global events.
• On the other hand, to infiltrate and constrain – a “harsher” category of operations that
do not involve seducing its opponents but rather bending them. Through infiltration, Beijing
seeks to slowly penetrate these societies to hinder any potential action against the Party’s interests. Constraining them fits within a wider dynamic: a “punitive” or “coercive” diplomacy is
gradually becoming a systematic policy of sanctioning any state, organization, company, or individual that threatens the Party’s interests. The CCP uses an incredibly wide range of retaliatory
measures, targeting all players in all fields – with a significant increase in these tactics since 2018.
Infiltrations and constraints are usually carried out through a nexus of intermediaries. And these
practices target the following categories:
- The diasporas, defined ethnically by Beijing. Beijing aims to create and sustain a feeling of
belonging to one nation by blurring the distinction between Chinese citizens and overseas Chinese,
hence homogenizing very heterogeneous communities. Its goal is twofold: on the one hand, to
control these diasporas so that they do not threaten the government – Beijing is leading what the
NGO Freedom House described as the “most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign
of transnational repression in the world.” In practice, this involves surveilling these communities,
identifying the members and infiltrating them, maintaining constant pressure on them, intimidating, threatening, and/or constraining them one way or another, even physically assaulting them; but
also pressuring the states where they reside to possibly getting them arrested and extradited. On
the other hand, the Party mobilizes these communities to serve its interests, benefitting from their
knowledge of their country of residence. To convince and galvanize them, the Party uses more or
less “gentle” cooptation methods.
- The media, Beijing explicitly aims to establish a “new world media order.” To do so, the
government has invested €1.3 billion per year since 2008 to better control its image in the
world, via state media that “must work to speak for the party’s will and its propositions, and
protect the party’s authority and unity.” These big media companies, which include CGTN,
CCTV, China Daily and People’s Daily, China Radio International, Xinhua and China New Service, enjoy a worldwide presence in several languages and on several continents. Still, the lack

of credibility of news reports and the Chinese media’s propagandist tone plays a key role in
the difficulties they encounter when competing with Western media and when trying to establish themselves on the international market. Chinese state media are present on all social networks, including those blocked in China (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram), and they
invest a lot of money to increase their online audience. Several elements indicate an artificial
inflation of their number of followers, a substantial part of which could in reality be bots and
fake accounts.
Beijing also tries to control Chinese-speaking media abroad through different means – including buybacks, cooperation and/or pressure from local Chinese associations – that have proved
quite successful, as the CCP is in a situation of near-monopoly. Its main leverage is not funding,
but rather the WeChat social media, whose rules push Chinese-speaking media to register on
its Chinese version, hence in China, where they are subjected to Party censorship. Because they
do not know the red lines, i.e. what is allowed, they tend to censor themselves to avoid being
suspended.
To influence non-Chinese mainstream media, Beijing uses a few tools. That includes penetration (by diplomats, the “China Watch” from China Daily and content provision); acquisition (with
consequences on the editorial line); cooptation (with compensations such as adds, all-expenses
paid trips/training courses in China, contracts for other companies of the same group, political appointments); training and networking (thousands of journalists from all over the world
are trained in China, on the condition of “correctly depicting China,” and Beijing also creates
professional networks via regular events); constraint; using the visa weapon against journalists
critical of the regime; family members and relatives who remain in China; but also various intimidation methods, including lawsuits (lawfare).
Finally, Beijing is also versed in container control, influencing every step of the global
information supply chain, with television, web platforms (WeChat, Weibo, TikTok) and
smartphones. Despite these many efforts however, Chinese media remain relatively unpopular abroad, particularly compared to Russian media, because they focus on China and rarely
on local issues.
- The diplomacy: two elements stand out. First, influence on international organizations and
norms: Beijing holds several key positions at the UN, provides a large portion of the funding,
deploys classic diplomatic efforts as well as clandestine influence operations (economic and political pressures, cooptation, coercion, and corruption) to strengthen its presence, frame debates
and control narratives, obtain timely endorsements, impose its agenda and influence the elaboration and interpretation of international norms. Its revisionist goal is to “change the rules of
the game.” The example of the WHO during the Covid-19 pandemic, the way Beijing succeeded
in controlling and shaping the international discussion on organ trafficking (of which China
was accused), in putting roadblocks on the work of Human Rights Council, or in hijacking the
Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations for political reasons – all show its influence,
which also extends to regional organizations, as evidenced in the Chinese efforts to infiltrate
European institutions and convince elites into relaying the Party’s propaganda, all in the name
of a Chinese-European “friendship.”
Second, the so-called “wolf warrior” diplomacy refers to the behavior of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs’ spokespersons and of a dozen diplomats who are all exhibiting increased
aggressiveness. Attacks can take traditional or newer shapes, using social media for instance,
and an unabashed use of invectives, reprimands or even intimidation. The Chinese position
is to systematically counter any speech running against the official CCP line, by blurring the
line between the CCP and China as a country-culture. While this practice has emerged publicly during the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2020, some particularly aggressive ambassadors had
pioneered it before, first and foremost Gui Congyou in Sweden and Lu Shaye in Canada. One
of the symptoms of this evolution is the “Twitterization” of the Chinese diplomacy: between
March 2019 and March 2020, the number of Twitter accounts belonging to embassies, consul414

ates, and Chinese ambassadors has grown by 250% – accounts often artificially amplified by a
network of fake accounts. France has also observed a radical change in the embassy’s posture
since Lu Shaye’s arrival in Paris in 2019.
Globally, this aggressive turn from Chinese diplomacy is counter-productive and has largely
contributed to the sharp deterioration of China’s image in the world these past years – which
actually raised a debate within the Chinese Party-State itself. Still, there are reasons to believe that
this is a long-lasting evolution, particularly because the aim is not so much to please us as it is to
please Beijing. Zealous diplomats probably hope to be perceived by Beijing as particularly loyal
and thus benefit from a career boost.
- The economy: economic dependence to China is often the first leverage used by Beijing.
Chinese economic coercion takes extremely various forms: denial of access to the Chinese market, embargo, trade sanctions, and investment restrictions, but also limitations in the number of
Chinese tourists (because some regions depend on them), or the organization of popular boycotts – all these have hit many countries these past few years, such as Japan, South Korea, and
now Australia. Additionally, Beijing is increasingly making censorship a prerequisite to access
the Chinese market, and many companies end up caving under pressure. Economic sanctions in
the world of professional sports are widespread and used by the CCP, with the NBA in 2019 for
instance. Germany is another interesting case to study, because the exposure (or over-exposure)
of the German economy to the Chinese market is the first policy variable in Berlin’s attitude
toward Beijing. Besides, Western companies include members of the CCP, all potential sources
of information for the Party.
- Politics. The overall goal is to penetrate target societies to influence public policy mechanisms.
To do so, Beijing develops relationships directly with political parties. Through the networks woven
by the ILD, it can identify and secure the loyalty of individual leaders who are ready to defend China’s image, and also learn about local political dynamics, or identify potentially exploitable sources
of tensions and vulnerabilities. Sustaining direct relationships with influential political figures of a
given country allow Beijing to infiltrate target societies, to gather official and non-official support,
and potentially circumvent obstacles within governments by relying on opposition or “retired”
politicians. So, in parallel to its relationships with political parties, Beijing also cultivates ties with
individuals, and these ties can take different shapes (contacts, “useful idiots,” agents of influence,
or real recruits).
Beijing also interferes in elections (during the past decade, China has apparently interfered
in at least 10 elections in 7 countries). Taiwan’s case is the most documented example, but there
were also cases of verified interference in local elections in Canada and Australia, each time in
the most Chinese-populated constituencies.
- Education, universities first and foremost, is among the Party’s most important targets. In
some places, such as Australia, universities are financially dependent on China (because Chinese
are the biggest group of foreign students by far), which makes these institutions less capable of
resisting Chinese influence operations. This dependence actually pushes institutions to actively
self-censor. Another problem is the surveillance and intimidation of Chinese students on foreign campuses, especially targeting students who are viewed as dissidents, the organization of
violent counter-protests, and sometimes physical assaults. Intimidations also target university
professors and staff members, pushing them to modify course content, teaching material and
planned events. These actions are carried out by a minority of Chinese students and, in some
cases, encouraged by Chinese authorities, through embassies and/or consulates. The main tool
used to maintain some amount of control over Chinese students abroad and to galvanize them
into defending China are the local branches of the Association of Chinese Students and Researchers (CSSA).
Another of Beijing’s goals is to shape China Studies, by giving researchers incentives (luxurious trips, part-time or full-time jobs in Chinese universities) and by pressuring them (visa denial,
intimidation, pressures on publishing houses to deter them from publishing books criticizing

the regime, pressures on relatives in China, even kidnappings and arbitrary arrests) which usually
lead to self-censorship.
The Party-State also uses universities to acquire new knowledge and technologies, either
openly and legally through joint-research programs, or illegally and covertly through theft or
espionage. To do so, China developed many recruitment programs, relying on a plethora of “recruitment stations” abroad, which are tasked to recruit and bring potential candidates to China,
and also to collect information on scientists and research programs in the host countries. Several
Chinese databases contain millions of profiles of scientists in the world. In many cases, the work
of recruited researchers actually contributes to the development of Chinese military capacities.
Through joint programs involving researchers holding several positions, dozens of universities
unintentionally help Beijing in building weapons of mass destructions or in developing surveillance technologies that serve to oppress the Chinese population. Several related scandals broke
out in 2020 and 2021.
Finally, Confucius Institutes and Classrooms are another important player of Chinese influence on education, and they are found everywhere in the world. And, under the pretense
of teaching Chinese language and culture, they can leverage influence over host institutions.
A revenue-generating and all-expense-paid language center is difficult to refuse and it creates a form of dependence (even subordination). Besides, Confucius Institutes (ICs) often
threaten academic freedom: teachers, often chosen by Beijing, must display “good political
and professional capacities” and “love for the motherland”; all teaching materials are provided by Beijing and are consistent with a Chinese representation of the world; altogether,
there are many documented cases of self-censorship in universities hosting ICs. It also
creates divisions inside the teaching staff. Additionally, some think that ICs are potentially
used to conduct espionage. For all these reasons, a growing number of ICs have been closed
these pasts few years.
- Think tanks, where Beijing’s strategy is dual. Firstly, Beijing is looking to settle branches of
Chinese think tanks abroad, like the CGTN Think Tank which has signed about fifty partnership
agreements with foreign think tanks, or the China-CEE Institute which shows Beijing’s interest
in Central and Eastern European countries. These countries are also gathered in a 17+1 format
where Beijing can promote its views and initiatives and divide Europe, trying to turn these countries against the EU. Second, Beijing exploits local intermediaries, sometimes think thanks. This
usually follows one of three scenarios: occasional partners that allow Beijing’s voice to be heard
locally (such as IRIS and its “Paris Forum on the Belt and Road Initiative,” co-organized with the
Chinese embassy); circumstantial allies spreading the Party’s narratives on a regular basis (such as,
also in France, the Fondation Prospective et Innovation), and accomplices sharing the CCP’s worldview
and whose interests are in line with the Party (such as the Schiller Institute). Local intermediaries
can also be publishing companies, as shown in France again by the La Route de la Soie publishing
company.
- Culture, first through the production and export of cultural products such as movies or TV
shows, music or books, which are powerful seduction tools, as we saw with the patriotic action
movies Operation Red Sea and Wolf Warrior I and II – all promoting the image of a responsible
China, of a “motherland” ready to any sacrifice to protect its citizens in peril. These cultural products also demonstrate the PLA’s force projection and combat forces capacities. Chinese influence
also reaches foreign cultural productions, including cinema, for example in Hollywood: to avoid
upsetting Beijing and maintain an access to the Chinese market, many American film studios make
compromises, or are even compromising themselves, while the Party-State blacklists producers,
film directors, and actors seen as hostile to China. Film studios cut and change scenes to avoid displeasing Beijing. The goals of the Chinese authorities are not only negative (i.e. preventing certain
content) but also positive (i.e. promoting different content). Beijing thus requires more filming in
China, more “good” narratives on China, and “good” Chinese characters helping others, or even
416

saving the world (hence the fact that, in recent years, evil Chinese characters have disappeared from
American movies).
Cinema is not an isolated case: other cultural sectors are under pressure from Beijing and are
asked to produce art that is compatible with the interests of the CCP. Refusing access to the
Chinese market is a systematic practice enforced against any artist criticizing the Party-State.
Amongst other types of pressures, Beijing hopes to push artists to change their art, or to stop
those who show their art in other parts of the world. It even pushes some to carry out the work
of Chinese censors. This is shown by several examples in museums, the video games industry
and in theaters, where some artists have censored themselves, which is the final goal – allowing
Beijing to win without fighting.
- Information manipulation is one of the most dynamic and documented tools. Beijing
simulates the authenticity of its operations by using fake accounts on social media, trolls and
astroturfing (to simulate spontaneous popular movements) – tactics almost systematically found
in Russian operations. These tactics were picked up by China, first on a national level to target
its own population, and then on an international level. The Party-State carries out a “distraction
strategy” over its entire territory to prevent collective actions that it does not generate or control
by using a high number of “Internet commentators” (incorrectly labelled “fifty cents’ armies”)
to “guide” public opinions. These commenters are paid (for example $25 for a new message of
more than 400 characters, 40 cents for reporting a negative comment that will be deleted). On
the international stage, trolls are much more aggressive. Usually controlled by the PLA or the
CYL, they defend, attack, feed controversies, insult, and harass. Another way to simulate authenticity is to ask third parties to publish content in exchange for a compensation – which Beijing
does by cultivating content factories (freelance Chinese-speakers based in Malaysia or elsewhere
who produce content paid between €12 and €126 per piece, depending on the length), to use AI
more and more often to generate texts, and to use other methods such as buying one-time messages, buying an influence over an account, buying an account or a page, and finally, recruiting
an “influencer.”
Actually, since 2019, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have been keener on sounding the alarm
about some campaigns from China. Dozens of thousands of accounts have been suspended for
that reason. Among them was found an enduring campaign that started in 2017 and that has targeted critics of the Chinese regime, adapting itself to various events (Hong Kong, the pandemic,
and the U.S. elections), surviving successive interventions from these platforms because of their
capacity to create or activate new accounts in a few days. The “Spamouflage Dragon” network
was identified and analyzed by Graphika in four consecutive reports, which focused on dormant
accounts and bought or stolen accounts amplifying Chinese propaganda and attacking the United States in Chinese or in English. Some of these accounts had AI-generated profile pictures
– a practice now often observed in Chinese operations on social media. Other campaigns also
highlighted the importance of the language used (use of vernacular Cantonese with traditional
Chinese characters to pose as Hong Kong citizens) and the role played by private intermediaries,
including by digital marketing companies.
An important component of these campaigns is that they do not only defend China: promoting the Chinese model involves degrading others, including liberal democracies, similarly to what
Russian operations have been doing for years. At least three tactics are used to that end: discredit
the opponent’s capacities; fan the flames of controversial topics, particularly regarding racism
and police violence in the United States; and try to create panics.
The PLA is at the center of these maneuvers: it uses social media for “overt” influence by
spreading propaganda, often for dissuasion and psychological warfare, and for covert hostile
operations against foreign targets. Many publications have shown that its researchers do not confine themselves to learning Russian and U.S. techniques, they also theorize “war through social
media,” acknowledging using it for offensive purposes, including political interference. The PLA

also displays interest in the use of database and artificial intelligence to “guide public opinion on
a large scale,” including to “influence electors in foreign countries.”
- Among other tools used by Beijing in its influence operations, we found citizen movements,
particularly pro-independence movements (the Party-State has deployed the same strategy in New
Caledonia and in Okinawa. They hope to gain control of the economy from the inside, getting
closer to local political leaders through several friendship associations, even manipulating information to encourage pro-independence movements following Beijing’s interests) and pacifist movements, as shown by the No Cold War group. Chinese tourists (who make up the sector’s biggest
market, because they are the most numerous, and spend the most) are another important leverage:
by controlling the number of tourists, Beijing pressures other governments. Beijing also uses tourists to spread messages and strengthen its claims in the South China Sea. Influencers are another
category that the Party relies on, especially Western YouTubers, used to spread Chinese propaganda, whatever their personal motivations (they can be forced, bought or simply seduced). Foreign
academics, whose motivations are similarly diverse, can be used as well. Finally, Beijing carries out
a so-called “hostage diplomacy,” a significant tool in power relations and influence operations, as
evidenced by cases in Sweden, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Taiwan.

Taiwan and Hong Kong are at the forefront of Beijing’s “political warfare,” both
democratic and liberal strongholds over which China claims sovereignty. China’s willingness
to intervene is made more important and facilitated by a few factors, such as a common
language (notwithstanding a few variations), an economic dependency, and the freedom
of the press that is the rule in these territories – which allows China to influence local
narratives. For all these reasons, Taiwan and Hong Kong have been outposts, the first
ones confronted to Chinese influence operations. But for Beijing, these territories are also
training grounds, “R&D labs” for operations that can subsequently be refined and
implemented in other targets globally1 – such as Georgia and Ukraine were for Russian
operations (→ p. 626). As such, they are important cases to study because they amount to
sentinels, “canaries in the mine,”2 and indicators of what could happen next.
For a long time, one could question the similarity in the trajectories, because there are
essential differences between Hong Kong and Taiwan on the one hand, and all of the other
cases on the other: Beijing does not claim sovereignty over Australia, Canada, and Sweden,
for example, and people do not speak Chinese there. How could Taiwan and Hong Kong
be seen as relevant precedents for these countries and for the rest of the world? Yet, two
things have happened in recent years: one, intensified attacks against Hong Kong and
Taiwan (so much so that, since 2019, Twitter and Facebook have formally attributed to
Beijing dismantled operations on their platforms)3 and, second, some tactics, hitherto
limited to Taiwan and Hong Kong, have been extended to other targets. A difference
remains, admittedly, but in the intensity of the operations, not in their nature. Currently,
there is no doubt that Beijing implements tactics against these two targets that will later be
used against the rest of the world.
The first step in the expansion of Chinese operations occurred in Australia and
New Zealand. Retrospectively, from a European or North American perspective, these
two countries appear to have been used as “guinea pigs” of Chinese interference – John
Garnaud uses the same metaphor of the “canary in a coal mine” to describe their respective
situations and that of Australia4 – because they had noted very early on the implementation of tactics subsequently used elsewhere in the world. Why these two countries?

Because of their large diasporas (relative to their population) out of which “a considerable
numbers [are] recent immigrants with relatives and close ties to China”5; because they are
located in what Beijing sees as its sphere of influence, because their economies are highly
dependent on China, because they attract a high number of Chinese students and, finally,
because of their relative lack of regulations on financing political party (up until recently).6 According to former diplomat Chen Yonglin, who defected in 2005, Australia was
identified very early on as the “weak link in the Western camp,” and it became the place
where the Party-State was able to “test its infiltration and subversion methods” given its
openness, its demographics, its proportion of Chinese immigrants and its multiculturalism.7
The second step of this expansion focused on the rest of the world, particularly
– but not only – on Europe and North America.8
Australia9 and the United States10 have led to a sizable scholarly literature. In Europe,
the United Kingdom,11 the Czech Republic,12 and, to a lesser extent, Germany13 have
also been studied. All these countries – that we also visited to prepare this report – are mentioned in the previous sections and included in our many examples. Yet, for our in-depth
case studies, we decided to focus on other places: Taiwan, Singapore, Sweden,
Canada, but also the operations that targeted Hong Kong protestors in 2019, and
framed the Covid-19 as an American virus in 2020.

Chapter 1

TAIWAN

Chinese influence operations had already targeted Taiwan, its institutions, political parties, civil society before, even when Kuomintang (KMT) – which is favorable to mainland
China (One China policy) – ruled the country, for example during Ma Ying-jeou’s presidency
(2008-2016). Truth be told, the United Front has always been very active in Taiwan.1 But
these maneuvers intensified after the Sunflower Student Movement that saw students
occupy the legislative Yuan, the Taiwanese parliament, in March and April 2014: at that
point, Beijing certainly came to the conclusion that Ma did not have enough control over
the situation to implement a pro-Chinese agenda. Their concerns were confirmed two years
later when, in 2016, Tsai Ing-wen was elected president and her Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan independence, won a majority of the seats in parliament.
Since 2016, cross-strait relations have deteriorated, and China’s “political warfare” in Taiwan has become harsher. As J. Michael Code explained, the Chinese strategy
in Taiwan usually consists in combining incentives (to “win hearts and minds”) and coercive measures to constrain decision-makers while weakening democratic institutions. The
DPP’s rise to power pushed Beijing to review the balance between these two poles.2 The
hope of seducing Taiwanese people is now relatively faint,3 first because the feeling
of belonging to the Chinese nation has deteriorated in recent years, so much so that only
2% of Taiwanese inhabitants define themselves as only Chinese compared to 62.6% as
solely Taiwanese.4 Then, Xi Jinping’s martial speech in January 2019, which mentioned a
potentially forced reunification if necessary, and the Hong Kong crisis during the summer
and the fall of that year acted as powerful repellents. China now focuses on coercive
measures. They have become easier to implement because, during Ma Ying-jeou’s eight
years in power, “cross-Strait ties were opened up […] his administration made little effort to
increase its counterintelligence capabilities in a manner commensurate with the new opportunities for penetration from China that resulted from the loosened restrictions. That created a number of new avenues for the CCP to penetrate, influence, and corrode Taiwanese
institutions.”5 Taiwan perfectly illustrates the Chinese “Machiavellian moment,”
i.e. the conviction that it is safer to be feared than to be loved (→ p. 619).

Overall, the Taiwanese society is particularly vulnerable to Chinese operations
for a plethora of reasons, and first because China claims sovereignty over this territory where the same language, or even languages, are spoken. Mandarin (Guoyu in
Taiwanese) is the official language but the mother tongue of less than 20% of the population; 70% of the population speaks Taiwanese, which is essentially derived from the
Minnan dialect, 10 to 15% of the population speaks Hakka, and 2% an aboriginal language.
Young Taiwanese born after 1990 are very attached to democratic and liberal values – but
the risk is that they are not mobilized during elections, particularly among those working in
Taipei who must go back to their district of origin to vote.
Another weakness is that the Taiwanese society is polarized around several issues.
The polarization is first reflected in Taiwan’s relationship with China (pro-unification/
pro-independence) even if this divide has lessened in the past few years. The population
is also divided over societal questions such as gay marriage, pension reform, agriculture,
and so on. The media landscape is likewise polarized, as it reflects the society and
is also largely infiltrated by Beijing. The Online Media Fractionalization indicator developed by the Digital Society Project (DSP)6 showed that “major online media outlets in
Taiwan provide very different presentations of the same events. Since Taiwanese people
consume online media quite extensively […] the Chinese disinformation strategy and
resulting online information fractionalization is likely to have a detrimental impact on
Taiwan’s democracy.”7
Taiwanese media also suffer from a concentration of capital, from a race for clickbait
(a “tabloidization” of outlets) and overwork (some journalists having to produce 4 to
8 articles a day).8 As a result, journalists do not take enough time to cross-check their
sources or to verify information. J. Michael Cole, who worked at the Taipei Times – owned
by the biggest press holding on the island – for more than seven years, explained that this
“very poor tradition of fact checking, or double-checking, or corroborating information
[…] makes Taiwan ripe for the injection of disinformation in its bloodstream.”9 Finally,
the verticality of relationships inside a newsroom, which stiffles young reporters, and
the lack of incentive (or time) for investigative journalism are additional vulnerabilities.10
Besides, Taiwan has the second highest social network penetration in the world
(88%)11: 83% of the population gets its information online and 59% through social networks.12 In other words, Taiwanese people are very “connected,” most of them have an
account on one or several social media platforms, and they are incidentally particularly
vulnerable to the disinformation that circulates on these networks. All these reasons
explain why, according to several reports, Taiwan is one of the countries most at risk
of disinformation in the world.13

That being said, Rush Doshi insists that it is not only about disinformation and propaganda. In Taiwan more than anywhere else, Beijing’s goal is to “control every step of
the information supply chain. Targets range from those that create content (journalists
and researchers) to the institutions that publish and validate it (television stations and wire
services) and, finally, to the platforms that often provide the final outreach to consumers
(social media websites and digital TV infrastructure).”14 We will see that Beijing uses both
the carrot and the stick, both positive measures (incentives, rewards) and negative
actions (intimidations, threats, sanctions) at each of these stages.
More broadly, in applying the full repertoire of “political warfare” tactics, the CCP
has two main goals in Taiwan: first, weaken its democratic institutions, including
elections, and the trust, morale, and resistance of the population. Second, divide the society by exacerbating its weaknesses: Chinese state media ostensibly want to “lebanize”15
Taiwan: they strive to pit communities against each other, target the country’s cohesion,
including its territorial cohesion by pitting regions against each other and paying particular
attention to the islands. To reach that goal, the Party uses two types of resources: traditional
Chinese media and local relays.

I. From the outside: How traditional Chinese media penetrate
Taiwan
Traditional media stands for the media that existed before the advent of the Internet and
of new communication technologies, mainly in print (press and books), radio and television
formats – even though they have also developed new digital platforms since then. Among
the traditional Chinese media, we distinguish the traditional (or generalist) media which
cover all sorts of topics and do not target one particular audience, for instance the newspapers Global Times and People’s Daily and media outlets specifically dedicated to Taiwan,
such as the Voice of the Straits radio, the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation and the Haifeng
publishing company (→ p. 100).

A. The use of conventional media
Chinese conventional media are a powerful vector to spread the Party’s propaganda, but they only exert a limited influence on Taiwan and on Taiwanese people.
Apart from the radio, (that can be freely listened to if it is aired close enough to Taiwan) it
is impossible for other channels (press, television) to open in Taiwan without the approval
of Taiwanese authorities. This is the reason why radio has historically been the preferred
mean of diffusion of the Party’s propaganda in Taiwan, being a rather inexpensive tool that
is easy to set up.16

Nowadays, Chinese television channels such as CCTV or CGTN seem to have a
limited potential for influence because they do not broadcast in Taiwan, and even though
Taiwanese inhabitants can access their content online. But this latter option requires active
engagement from viewers, unlikely to be taken given the current context of relative distrust
toward Chinese narratives and the increased competition for the viewers’ attention in the
current media landscape.17
With the Internet, Chinese newspapers can offer web versions of print articles, making sharing or viewing content particularly easy online, regardless of where readers are.
While their content is easy to access, it is not the most attractive to Taiwanese
audiences who enjoy a large variety of national newspapers. Besides, Chinese newspapers are not always available in traditional characters. Taiwanese people can generally
read simplified Chinese characters, but most prefer traditional characters, out of convenience or by choice, given the simplified characters’ political connotations, as they are
immediately linked to the language of the CCP. Hence, Chinese articles with a version
in traditional Chinese characters are more likely to be read by Taiwanese audiences than
articles solely written in simplified Chinese characters. As a result, many newspapers
have a web version in traditional characters, for example the Xinhua press agency and
the PLA Daily.18 The People’s Daily, the China Daily and the Guangming Daily do not appear
to offer it. However, almost all offer an English version for their international audiences
and some – such as Xinhua and the People’s Daily – have an entire section dedicated to
Taiwanese news.
Radio programs are now also available online. And, very early on, the main Chinese
networks, such as CNR and CRI, set up networks dedicated to Taiwanese audiences. In 1954, as nationalist and communist forces were still fighting, the CNR had
already opened two channels for Taiwanese audiences. The “Chinese Voice”, or CNR-5,
now covers cross-strait and Taiwanese news in Mandarin. The “Shenzhou Voice”, or
CNR-6, offers cultural programs in Mandarin, Hakka, and Minnan dialects.19 The latter
two dialects are the most widely used languages in Taiwan and in the Chinese province
of Fujian, which faces the island from the other side of the strait. Chinese media
often claim that these programs are highly successful in Taiwan: they recently
reported approximately 2 million Taiwanese listeners.20 Likewise, CRI, which was created in 1949, developed programs in various dialects, including Minnan and Hakka, for
people of Chinese descent. Today, the radio station “Chinese Voice in the World” offers
programs in these two dialects as well as in languages from Guangzhou, Chaozhou, and
Wenzhou.21
In addition to the two radio programs dedicated to Taiwan, the CNR set up a web
portal, HelloTaiwan – or Nihao Taiwan in 2000 to reach a younger audience. The
stated objective is to promote China-Taiwan relations and to allow people of Chinese
17. The current context is indeed characterized by an increase of negative opinions about the PRC and by an
increasingly defined Taiwanese identity. See Voir Kat Devlin, Christine Huang, “In Taiwan, Views of Mainland
China Mostly Negative,” Pew Research Center (12 May 2020); Chung Li-hua and Jake Chung, “Most Taiwanese
Feel that China is Unfriendly: Poll,” Taipei Times (28 Mar. 2020); Keoni Everington, “Record 83% of People in
Taiwan Identify as Taiwanese Amid Wuhan Virus Outbreak,” Taiwan News (24 Feb. 2020).

descent to “better understand” China. Chinese sources say that the website is visited
around 12 million times each day, which would make HelloTaiwan one of the main platforms for Chinese propaganda in Taiwan. This platform is part of the nexus of
informational operations within which we found units of the PLA’s Base 311,
such as the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC) and Voices of the
Strait (VTS).22 In fact, Zhang Xida, a HelloTaiwan and CNR journalist, was found
spreading false information on YouTube and Facebook through videos in which he pretended to be Taiwanese (→ p. 467).
Finally, publications from major publishing companies in China such as the
ones tied to Beijing University (北京大学出版社), East China Normal University (华
东师范大学出版社), the Red Flag University (红旗出版社) or the Chinese Academy
for Social Sciences Press (社会科学文献出版社) can be accessed from Taiwan, at
least on the main book vendors’ websites such as Bokelai (博客来).23 Books do not
allow reacting on breaking news as easily as newspapers, radio, and television can. But
they can help shape the long-term intellectual landscape. Many Chinese initiatives thus
promote cross-strait relationships in the publishing sector, which is considered
as playing an important role in the pursuit of the “cultural fusion” between Taiwan
and China.24 The goal reflects Beijing’s ambition to influence or even control
narratives and ideas in the Taiwanese intellectual world. An organization subordinate to the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO → p. 84), the Jiuzhou Center for Cultural
Communication (九州文化传播中心), organized a cross-strait forum for the publishing industry in 2018, together with the Fujian Academy for Social Sciences, to
celebrate thirty years of cooperation in the sector.25
In Taiwan, structures such as the Tonsan (唐山出版社) and Renjan (人間出版
社) publishing companies, the Observer (觀察) and Yuanwang (遠望) journals, or The
Commercial Press Taiwan (臺灣商務印書館) have already participated in this type of
cross-strait forums; some of their leaders pleaded for a better diffusion of Chinese
books in Taiwan during these events.26 Some actions are even instigated by Taiwanese
people, such as the forum organized by the dean of the private Nanhua University in
Taiwan (南华大学),27 which has convened every year since 2005 around themes such
as the construction of China’s soft power, cultural fusion, or the impact of digitalization on the publishing sector.28
While conventional media are not the most efficient in decisively influencing
the Taiwanese audience nowadays, they still play an important role in relaying
the official Chinese narrative. Incidentally, the more a narrative is repeated, the more

familiar it becomes, and the more likely is it that its audience will adhere to it. Chinese
media thus regularly repeats narratives reinforcing the idea that “reunification”
with Taiwan is unavoidable and legitimate,29 criticizing official Taiwanese positions and the support Taiwan may receive from the United States,30 and also narratives that are part of a “psychological warfare” aimed to discredit the Taiwanese
armed forces’ ability to defend themselves against the PLA, hence fostering fear among
the public.31 The Global Times, for example, frequently contributes to psychological warfare operations by maintaining a constant military tension, as if a Chinese invasion was
imminent, and by systematically exaggerating the reach of ongoing military exercises
(→ p. 478).32
Chinese media can also relay manipulated information intended for Taiwanese
audiences. This was the case with an operation that tried to make people believe that
President Tsai Ing-wen had lied about receiving her PhD from the London School
of Economics (→ p. 464),33 or another operation that pushed people to believe that
some Taiwanese tourists that had been stuck in Japan during typhoon Jebi were evacuated with a Chinese embassy bus, but only after accepting to identify as Chinese34
(→ p. 456).
To make up for the weaknesses of traditional “general” Chinese media and to increase
their influence capabilities in Taiwan, China also put together media outlets specifically
dedicated to a Taiwanese audience.

B. The creation of dedicated outlets
In Part II, we briefly introduced three media dedicated to Taiwan, all of them Base 311
offshoots: VTS, CHBC, and Haifeng. In this case study of Taiwan, we will further study
how they work and what practical actions they carry out against the island.

1. The Voice of the Strait (VTS)
VTS is a front organization for a unit of the PLA Base 311 (→ p. 101). Before
its creation, other radios from Shanghai, Huadong, or Fujian had developed programs
in Mandarin, as well as in the Minnan and Hakka dialects, for Taiwanese audiences.
Eleven Chinese radios focused on communication with Taiwan in 2011, VTS and
CHBC included. In fact, radio is seen as an essential tool in the United Front’s

strategy to ensure “Taiwan’s liberation35” because it has many advantages: contrary
to newspapers and TV, it can be freely broadcast from China to Taiwan, requires little
financial resources and staff and it can interact with listeners who can participate.36
Besides, the human voice, as opposed to the neutrality that comes with a written piece,
is seen as being more persuasive. Hence the value in airing recorded messages of
support such as “Strength to Wuhan!” or celebrating the solidarity between the
two shores during the Covid-19 pandemic using people with a Taiwanese accent.
These help persuade listeners that China was supported by the Taiwanese population.37
Radio is a media that also draws its strength from its capacity to respond quickly to an
event. Since audiences are always more marked by the first version of events that
they hear than by subsequent versions – a cognitive psychology bias known as anchoring – VTS’ former director Liu Linlan (柳林岚) claimed that politically-aimed radios
such as VTS are playing a crucial part in quickly reacting to impose the adequate
version of facts first, particularly on topics pertaining to the cross-strait relationship.38
In 2005, she wrote that VTS’ mission was to improve knowledge and understanding of
reforms and modernization in China and various types of exchanges between the two
sides of the strait, to contribute to reinforcing the feeling of fraternity between populations and the feeling of belonging to the Chinese Nation, but also to promote Chinese
culture and values.39

a. Using “voice carriers” to reach a wider audience
It seems that VTS launched an offensive to penetrate the Taiwanese media landscape
after its 50th birthday celebrations. Since the beginning of the 2010s, VTS has indeed sought
to build a network of collaborators in some Taiwanese media to use them as “voice
carriers” (借台唱).40 By letting its stories be aired to already-established audiences, VTS
is widening the reach of its messages in an increasingly competitive media landscape.41 For
example, VTS signed a cooperation agreement with Libra Radio (非凡音联播网) in 2008
that provided for shared programs, the transmission of Libra Radio’s audience measurements to VTS, and for the broadcasting of VTS’ news reports on Libra Radio for forty
minutes every day.42 Libra Radio broadcast on the Matsu Islands, north of Taiwan, as well
as on the coastal cities of Fujian.43 Hence, its audience is both Taiwanese and Chinese.
VTS also targets Chinese who maintain close ties with Taiwan because, if they are
convinced by the content of the shows, they can become efficient relays sharing these

ideas with Taiwanese people.44 In addition to local radios, VTS has also partnered with
local newspapers. According to its former director, Zhong Zhigang (钟志刚), VTS regularly cooperates with several Taiwanese publications such as Want Daily, (旺報), the Taiwan
Daobao (臺灣導報), or the Liberty Times (自由時報) in the hopes of increasing its influence
in Taiwan.45

b. Using local dialects for a rapprochement
The Minnan and Hakka dialects are spoken on both sides of the strait and are
used to bring the continent and the island closer together. Taiwanese people speak
mandarin – calling it guoyu (國語) rather than putonghua (普通话) as Chinese do – but
more than 70% of the population speaks Minnan and around 15% belong to the Hakka
ethnic group. As such, collaborating with Taiwanese radio broadcasting in Minnan
or Hakka was identified as an efficient tool to penetrate the Taiwanese society.46
In 2009, VTS partnered with six Taiwanese radios broadcasting in Hakka to create a
group of channels operating in Taiwan’s region.47 According to former VTS director
Zhang Zhigang, this action is considered to have marked the actual entry of continental
China into the Taiwanese radio environment.48 VTS aired its first show, co-hosted with
a Taiwanese radio station, Formosa Hakka Radio Station (寶島客家廣播電台), in May
2009.49 VTS joined the Hakka Radio Cooperation network (客 属电台协作网) created
by the China Radio and Television Association (CRTA, 中国广播电视 协会)50 in 2012.
Similarly, in the Minnan dialect, VTS joined the Broadcast Cooperative Network for
the Minnan Dialect (闽南话广播协作网), also created by the CRTA, in 2010. The five
remaining members of this network are the Taiwan Broadcasting Center of the China
National Radio (中央人民广播电台对台湾广播中心), the Southeast Broadcasting
Corporation (东南广播公司), the Minnan Voice Broadcasting of the Xiamen Media
Group station (厦门广播电视集团闽南之声广播), the Citong Voice Broadcasting of
the Quanzhou Radio station (泉州人民广播电台刺桐之声广播) and the Zhangzhou
Radio Station (漳州人民 广播电台).51

c. Diversifying communication supports
Originally, VTS was a traditional organ of propaganda, but after more than 60 years,
the old radio station had to evolve to keep pace with new technologies and to adapt to
the needs of the new generations to maintain an influence. One of the major components of this strategy was to diversify its supports of communication. In 2000, VTS
set up a website at about the same time HelloTaiwan was created (你好台灣), and both
hoped to target younger audiences. The website allowed VTS to adopt different sup44. 柳林岚 (Liu Linlan), 郭红斌 (Guo Hongbin), and 刘洪涛 (Liu Hongtao), “按照大众传媒规律办好对台广

ports: articles, podcasts, and videos of variable length, in order to target and adapt
its content to different audiences. In August 2013, VTS even published the first online
video streaming channel aimed at Taiwan: the Huaxia Jingdian (華夏經典網絡電
台).52 In 2015, two years after former VTS director Liu Linlan published an article on
the important opportunities offered by WeChat53 as a powerful application for messaging, information sharing and services, VTS created an account on the platform.54
The “New Media” (新媒体) – WeChat, Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, Plurk,55 attracted
a lot of attention, as evidenced by the high number of articles from VTS affiliates and
others on the topic. They are a significant challenge because they intensify competition
for the public’s attention but also an opportunity because they are additional tools to
penetrate and manipulate the Taiwanese “public opinion environment.”56 In his
2013 speech at the National Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work (全国宣
传思想工作会议), Xi Jinping claimed that the Internet had become the main fighting
ground of the war on public opinions and that victory there was crucial.57 Ultimately,
in line with the secretary general of the Party, VTS has been striving to win the war on
public opinions.

d. Turning VTS into a mass media
If the diversification of the means of communication was necessary, so was the evolution of the content of the messages. Mid-2000s, executives thought that VTS was too
specialized and that it needed to become a mainstream or “mass” media.58 This was
considered to be the most efficient way to spread propaganda in Taiwan. Answering the
question: “how to lower [the target audience’s] mistrust and hostility?” former director
Lui Linlan wrote in 2005 that “there is only one way to do that. Communication toward
Taiwan has to be conducted through mass media. Propaganda needs to be integrated in a
real radio [programming]. Circulating propaganda must be implemented in a subtle
fashion, without leaving traces. Only then will [the target audience] let its guard
down, forget you are United Front, be willing to listen to your programs, and they
will ultimately trust the broadcast content.”59 In other words, by becoming a mass
media, VTS aims to drown its propaganda in a flow of information, sneaking it to
the audience.

e. Adapting its message to the target audience
Likewise, VTS executives were aware of the need to use the target audience’s language in
order to fulfill their goals. This meant adapting the content to local specificities, for example
by speaking the audience’s specific dialect, but also adapting the message to different age
groups, with a style that “spoke” to young people. On the matter of military-related propaganda toward Taiwan (对台军事宣传), its former director Zhong Zhigang explained that
a communication strategy tailored to each identified audience had to be adopted.
He highlighted three such categories: ordinary Taiwanese soldiers, pro-independence
forces, and the Taiwanese population. According to Zhong, a Taiwanese soldier’s only
concern was “not knowing for whom he is fighting” (不知为谁作战) and, for that reason,
he described them as having only “vague” patriotic aspirations (国家民族精神模糊). As
a result, the PLA’s communication strategy needed to guide them positively, and to lead
them toward the “truth.” However, he noted that a harsher tone needed to be used against
pro-independence Taiwanese forces. The PLA’s commitment and willingness to fight had
to be made blatant and dissuasive narratives chosen. Finally, the civil population had to be
told in a reassuring and educational tone that the PLA’s mission was only to protect its fellow citizens.60 Here, Zhong relied on basic principles of psychological warfare, and made
them more prominent in public opinion warfare.

f. Quickly reacting
Former VTS directors Liu Linlan and Zhong Zhigang have insisted on the importance
of reacting quickly and efficiently to impose a specific version of events and frame
the debate, and for the “PLA’s good image to penetrate the head of the population in
Taiwan.”61 Given that VTS gives a lot of importance to military and defense-related issues
– several of its programs are actually dedicated to them62 – Zhong pointed to a few examples of news that needed to be followed and well-covered, such as the PLA’s peacekeeping
operations abroad, the protection of China’s sovereignty in the South China Sea, joint
Sino-Russian military exercises, and news on flagship technologies such as the J-20 fighter
aircraft or the Liaoning aircraft carrier. However, this did not only apply to military issues.
When a columnist for the Taiwan Daobao published an op-ed titled “[the] Chinese dream
and the Taiwanese dream of independence are both just dreams,63” VTS responded in the
same breath with articles such as “[the] Chinese dream is the highest common denominator
between both sides of the Strait – a discussion with M. Mo Shangsang”64 and “[how] could
one compare the Taiwanese dream of independence with the Chinese dream”65; both were
published on its own website and on Taiwan Daobao.66 We were unable to find the columnists’ publication, but VTS op-eds were still online years later.

2. The China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation (CHBC)
CHBC is a front organization for a unit of the PLA Base 311 (→ p. 103) and it is
particularly active in the organization of events promoting the Chinese culture and crossstrait relations (more prominently than on VTS).

a. The organization of events promoting the Chinese culture
CHBC partnered with VTS and the Chinese National Radio (CNR) in 2009 to celebrate the Beijing–Hangzhou Grand Canal (京杭大运河), which was described as
a precious legacy from centuries of imperial dynasties, and as still contributing to the
economic development of the regions it connects.67 In 2013, CHBC partnered with
the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (中国航天科技集团公司),
the Fujian Provincial Development and Reform Commission (福建省发改委) and the
Fujian Association for Science and Technology (福 建省科协) to organize a series of
events on the “space dream”- (航天梦); according to that narrative, the “dream”
could only be achieved if it was taken up by Chinese people on both sides of the
Strait.68 In a very different field, CHBC has organized cultural competitions, such as
the ocean-themed new songs contest for students on both sides of the strait, which
took place in Fuzhou in 2013.69
CHBC also sponsors events that contribute to the promotion of China, even if it
does not directly organize them. In 2019, CHBC was among the seven sponsors of the third
edition of the Chinese classical poetry recitation competition organized by Aiyinsitan FM
Radio (爱音斯坦FM) on both sides of the strait, Hong Kong, and Macao (海峡两岸暨香
港 澳门地区中华经典诗文诵读大赛).70 In 2012, CHBC sent about forty of its journalists to interview a hundred China-based Taiwanese entrepreneurs to collect their stories as
part of an initiative of the China Association for Promotion of Chinese Culture (中华文
化发展促进会). Testimonies were gathered during a five-month fieldwork and presented
during the closing ceremony in Wenzhou. Wang Shu, CHBC’s director at the time, and a
member of the military and Base 311 commander, said this action, called “Chinese Cultural
Development Strategies – Four Cultural Salons Across the Taiwan Strait” (大陆台商财富
故事), was an opportunity to show the contribution of Taiwanese people to the economic
development of the cities they settled in and to reveal the “real” family links between them
and the local population.71
The flagship event to which CHBC takes part is the Forum for the Development
of the Chinese Culture (中华文化发展论坛). This forum aims to strengthen ties
between China and Taiwan and to promote the Chinese culture, in other words to
increase China’s soft power. This forum, which was called “Strategy for the Development

of Chinese Culture – Cultural Salon for Both Sides of the Strait” (中华文化发展方
略—两岸四地文化沙 龙) during its first three editions, was launched by the China
Academy of Culture (中国文化院) – which is owned by the CEFC China Energy Co.
Ltd. (→ p. 117) – and the CAPCC (→ p. 124).72 CHBC participated in the organization
of its second edition in 2014,73 which allowed the forum to gain in depth and influence.
The seventh edition took place in Beijing in August 2019 and gathered 180 experts,
journalists, and young people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, compared to only
30 people during the first edition.

Seventh edition of the Forum on the development of Chinese Culture, Digital Culture and Media Communication, China –
Beijing, August 2019. Organizers: China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation, Internet Society of China (http://www.chbcnet.com/
web/remit/special/zhwhfzlt2019/index.shtml).

Each edition has a specific theme. The 2019 edition, co-organized with the Internet
Society of China, focused on “Internet culture and media communication” (网络文化
与媒体传播). Executive Director Chen Guojun (陈国军), who is also a member of
the military, spoke for CHBC at the event and called for the media to guide the population on both sides of the Strait in recognizing China’s “real history” and rejecting independence movements; he reminded his audience that modern dissemination
channels created “historic opportunity” (历史机遇) to “[tell] China’s history correctly”
and “to correctly recount the story of the relations between China and Taiwan” (讲好
中国故事，讲好两岸故 事).74 The fifth edition, taking place in 2017 in Fuzhou, and
named “One only Chinese family on both sides of the Strait” (两岸族韵·中华一家)
set for itself to explore the cultural legacies of ethnic minorities in China and Taiwan
in order to intensify cultural exchanges between ethnic groups on both sides of
the Strait and create collaboration opportunities.75 Zhu Xi (朱瓯), the secretary general
of the Foundation for the Development of the Chinese Nation (中华民族发展基金
会), claimed that the ruling DPP had launched an anti-Chinese campaign since he took
power in 2016, and that it and was embracing indigenous population with the sole goal

of winning over their votes and advancing their pro-independence cause.76 This forum
thus contributed to reinforcing ties between all ethnic groups and the “big Chinese
family” and to press for the big “Chinese dream” according to Zhao Yixian (赵一先),
deputy director of the KMT’s Working Commission on Ethnic Minorities (中国国民党
少数民族工作委员会).77
The fourth and sixth editions of the forum were held in Xiamen and focused on “the
legacy of the Chinese culture and the responsibility of the contemporary youth” (中华
文化传承与当代青年担当) and on “Cultural innovation and the responsibility of the
youth” (文化创新与青年担当) respectively.

b. The youth: A key target group
The youth is a key target group because it embodies the future of cross-strait
relations. Some of CHBC’s shows are incidentally explicitly conceived for young
audiences, as with “Liang’an qingnianhui” (两岸青年汇). CHBC president Qui Yu,
otherwise known as General-Major Yue Lei, pointed out in a 2017 speech that the
youth on both sides of the Strait had a role to play in the “protection of Chinese culture.”78 CHBC regularly organizes actions specifically dedicated to young Taiwanese
people, with the goal of making them like Chinese culture, to instill a sense of pride
in them as part of the same Chinese nation, and ultimately to strengthen a sense of
belonging.
In 2018, for example, and together with the Taiwan Affairs Office of the PRC’s State
Council, CHBC organized an exchange program for 50 Taiwanese students and
10 Chinese students to show them opportunities in the academic and business
sectors in several Chinese mainland towns.79 CBHC had previously co-organized an
Exchange Forum for Taiwanese students wishing to study or work in China (
台生大陆求学就业交流汇) in 2015.80 According to its president, Qiu Yu, this forum
aimed to inform young Taiwanese people about opportunities in China, to offer them
support and to create a communication platform between the two sides of the Strait.
Similarly, CHBC invited around twenty Taiwanese students to discover Qinghai in July
2016, in the hopes of fostering exchanges between that province and Taiwan. An executive from the Qinghai–Tibet railway company (青藏铁路公司) told them about the
company’s history and its weight on the socio-economic development of these two
huge provinces located in Western China.81 These actions targeting the youth show
that Chinese are betting on the long-term: to shape the youth’s opinions in such
a way that it favors Taiwan’s reunification with China, which would win back the island
without using military might.

c. One galaxy
The partners of the events organized by CHBC usually belong to the same galaxy: without surprise, there are VTS and the Haifeng publishing company, the other two
organizations directly affiliated to Base 311, but also the media partners such as the Want
Daily, the Chinese National Radio, the China Review News Agency or the HelloTaiwan
web platform. Most of these events are held under the aegis of the Taiwan Affairs
Office or of civilian organizations promoting cross-strait relations, including the China
Association for Promotion of Chinese Culture (CAPCC, 中华文化发展促进会), the
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots (中华全国台湾同胞联谊会) or also the
Collaborative Innovation Center for Peaceful Development of Cross-Strait Relations (两
岸关 系和平发展协同创新中心). The CAPCC was created in 2001 and it is now seen
as the PLA’s main platform for informal exchanges with Taiwan. It is probably run by
the former General Political Department’s Liaison Office of the CMC. In fact, two general
officers in that bureau held senior positions in the CAPCC (→ p. 124).82 Additionally, the
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots was created in 1981 and acts as a “bridge and
link” between Taiwanese people, the CCP, and the Chinese government.83 The Collaborative
Innovation Center for Peaceful Development of Cross-Strait Relations is another organization: created at the initiative of Xiamen University in 2013, the center brings together
the University of Fudan, Fujian Normal University and the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences to work toward a peaceful reunification with Taiwan.84

Not unlike VTS, CHBC has tried to penetrate the Taiwanese media landscape by
cooperating with local media. One of its most successful collaborations was set up with
Happy Radio (快樂聯播網). In October 2010, they partnered for the diffusion of a show

co-hosted by a Chinese CHBC anchor and a Taiwanese Happy Radio anchor. The show
was called Huaguang Kuaile Easy Go (华广快乐EZGO) – Huaguang referring to CBHC
and Kuaile to Happy Radio. The hour was divided between a serious part dedicated to
exchanging views on issues affecting both sides of the Strait, and a lighter part dealing with
Chinese culture, travel stories, or food. Exchanging views in such manner was meant to
show that, although there are disagreements between the two sides of the Strait, it
was still possible to understand each other and to share a common history and culture.85 CHBC also wanted to be able to share the Chinese narrative to the audience of its
Taiwanese collaborator. Happy Radio is indeed the second largest radio network in Taiwan,
after UFO Radio (飛碟聯播網). The show was first aired on three of Happy Radio’s stations before being extended to the seven channels, covering the whole Taiwanese territory.86
This partnership was the result of a rapprochement initiated by CBHC before 2010: CHBC
had invited Happy Radio’s executive director to events in China, later to visit CHBC’s headquarters and to collaborate on some occasional projects. CHBC now seeks to increase its
visibility in Taiwan, but also to increase China’s visibility (增进对大陆的理解认知) and
reduce anti-China opposition (消除对大 陆的对抗) there.87

3. Haifeng
Haifeng is the publishing company of the PLA Base 311 (→ p. 106). According to
the description of its activities on the Tianyancha trade database, Haifeng publishes propaganda writing and illustrated books for Taiwan.88 The topics vary: politics, economy,
history, law, culture, literature, arts. For instance, in 2011, the Haifeng publishing house
won the second edition of the publishing award the Chinese government awards every
three years (第二届中国出版政府奖), for its book Presentation of the cities in China (中国
城市巡礼).89 Published in 2009, for the 60th anniversary of the PRC, the book praised
the successes and developments of modern Chinese cities since the economic reform. It
was commended for including Taipei, Hong Kong, and Macao, thus taking a “true family
photo” of Chinese cities.
Several of Haifeng’s books promote national reunification, such as A Call from the Two
Shores: Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland (海峡两岸的呼唤:和平统一祖国) published
in 1999 by Xu Haoran (徐浩然), a former aid to Chiang Ching-kuo and member of the
Kuomintang’s revolutionary committee in the Jiangxi province.90 That same year, Lee Tenghui’s Commentary on the “Two States” Theory (评李登辉及其’两国论’)91 was released. In it,

Lee Teng-hui, the now-former Taiwanese president, rejected the idea of One China and
defended the implementation of inter-state relations between Beijing and Taipei. Two
years earlier, in 1997, Haifeng had published Hong Kong’s Retrocession and the Reunification of
the Motherland (香港回归与祖国统一).92 There is no doubt that there is an interest in
Taiwanese public affairs: a researcher at the CCP’s Central School published a book with
Haifeng in 2006 untitled All Aspects of the Policies of the Democratic Porgressist Party, in Power for
Four Years, toward Mainland China (民进党当局执政四年大陆政策面面观).93 A Taiwanese
Affairs Handbook (涉台事务知识手册)94 was published the following year, followed by
Policies and Rules toward Taiwan (对台政策法规)95 two years later.
Until then, former Haifeng directors had mostly published books on culture or art.
For instance, Jiao Honghui wrote several books on Chinese calligraphers,96 on folk culture
on both sides of the Strait,97 and on traditional Chinese celebrations.98 His successor Lu
Fentang edited a poetry collection in Hakka,99 as well as travel photography book adapted
from the “Photographers of the Two Shores” outings (see on the following page), such as
Fifteen Years of Shadows and Light (光影十五年).100
Previous Base 311 commanders also published books with the company. Its first
commander, Deng Changyu, published a book on autonomous regions in 2010.101 The
following year, his successor Wang Shu, published a book on the 1911 Chinese Revolution
under a pseudonym, for the revolution’s centennial.102 VTS also penned books published
by Haifeng, including one in 1997 on the links between the nation and the army.103 More
recently, in 2013, the VTS former editor-in-chief Lu Wenxing (卢文兴) published a book
on propaganda toward Taiwan.104 Finally, in 2014, the VTS former director Zhong Zhigang
authored a book on the Chinese dream.105
Major General Xin Qi, former director of the former General Political Department’s
Liaison Office, and a well-known figure in China,106 published a book with Haifeng on pho92. 香港回归与祖国统一 (Hong Kong’s Return and the Reunification of the Motherland), Haifeng Publishing House,

in 2011.108 Xin Qi is currently vice-president of the China Association for International
Friendly Contact (CAIFC), which is, as previously explained, a political warfare platform
affiliated with the PLA. Finally, another former vice-president for the CAIFC, Yi Xian,
published a Taiwanese Population Stories Series (台湾百姓故事丛书), a trilogy, in 2015.
Finally, it should be noted that Haifeng also published several books on psychological warfare, including A selection of Psychological Wars Carried out by Foreign Armies (外 国
军队心理战战例选评)109 and Psychological Warfare Leaflets (心理战传单), written by three
authors in 2009, including a professor at the National Defense University.110
Taiwanese people theoretically have access to books published by Haifeng insofar as they can be found on the websites of Taiwanese book vendors.111 However, the
actual appeal of these books is doubtful, given that they are displayed on these websites
without any picture or description, and they are relatively expansive. In addition, Haifeng
books are published in simplified characters, whereas Taiwanese people are used to traditional characters. Here, the lack of efforts undertaken to market and promote them
is surprising. Haifeng does not even have a website dedicated to its products, a catalogue
or at least a system to present its new books to readers who might be interested in them.
The publishing company did create a WeChat account in which it regularly publishes
some short texts, but WeChat is not the preferred social network in Taiwan. With book that
are not easily discoverable on the Taiwanese market and that do not necessarily correspond
to the target audience’s tastes and expectations, we can question Haifeng Publishing’s
actual ability to conduct “propaganda toward Taiwan” (对台宣传).

a. The events it organizes involve the same galaxy
However, Haifeng’s actions go beyond publishing books: it also regularly takes part
in events promoting Chinese culture and cross-strait relations. CHBC, VTS, and Haifeng
often co-organize events together, such as a 2015 ceremony commemorating the 70th
anniversary of the end of the Japanese War, which was attended by Jiao Honghui et Ai
Songru, otherwise known as Ai Ke;112 or a cultural event organized in 2013 under the aegis
of the CAPCC by CHBC, VTS, CNR and Haifeng.113
Haifeng’s flagship project seems to be the “Photographers of the Two Shores,” an
initiative it has organized yearly since 2002 with the Photographic Society of Taipei (
台北摄影学会, founded in 1956). It puts together a trip with a group of Chinese and
Taiwanese photographers to visit several cities and territories displaying Chinese wealth,

culture, and its successes to teach Taiwanese people about China and build friendships
between both sides of the Strait. This project rests on the so-called “two Huis”: Haifeng
executive Jiao Honghui, and Cai Denghui (蔡登辉) of the Photographic Society of Taipei.
Since leaving their respective positions, Jiao Honghui has continued to take part to the trips
as co-president of the Fujian Photographers’ Association and Cai Denghui as a member
of the Taiwan Cross-Strait Peace, Culture and Arts Alliance (台湾两岸 和平文化艺术联
盟). Other local photographers’ associations have been invited to participate in the project:
associations from the Chinese province of Yunnan and the city of Wuhan and from the
Taiwanese city of Tainan, and the counties of Nantou and Hsinchu in 2016 for instance.
Among the participants we also found several media. In 2016, it included the China News
Service, the Chinese daily Sanmin (三明日报), and the Taiwanese magazines Dujia Baodao (獨
家報導) and Lianyi Sheying (聯藝攝影). The academic field was also included that year, with
the participation of Cai Denglong, professor at the National Taiwan University of Sport
and National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi (蔡登龍), and a teacher from the Chiayi
Industrial Vocational High School. Finally, these Haifeng initiatives have often been carried
out with the full support and occasional participation of the CAPCC.114

II. From the inside: local intermediaries
Beijing goes around the Taiwanese central government by coopting a high number of local intermediaries: political parties, media, PR agencies, business persons, civil
society organizations, or cultural institutions working on both sides of the strait, as well as
diehard “blue” military communities, brought up with the myth of an unavoidable reunification. These local intermediaries are crucially important, first because they act as interpreters allowing cultural mediation; and second because they are already established and
thus benefit from an immediately available credibility and audience. By using them, not
only does Beijing cover its tracks (particularly because local intermediaries do not make
linguistic mistakes that might give away their foreign origins), it also increases its chances
of having an impact because the Taiwanese population will be reached out by people that
it knows, in its language, with its own cultural references. “China just has to pay for these
local groups to do the work for them,” a member of government summed up.115

The party is involved in an overt “media war on Taiwan,” the strategic goals of
which were laid out in 2004 by President Hu Jintao, at the fiftieth anniversary of the first
broadcast of the Chinese National Radio in Taiwan: ‘‘Entering the Island, Entering
the Household, and Entering the Mind (of the people)’’ (“入 岛、入户、入心”).116
In the early 2000s, China was mostly using outside media, from Hong Kong especially, to
try and influence the Taiwanese public opinion. Beijing then took on Lenin’s idea: “the

easiest way to capture a fortress is from within.”117 Going through local intermediaries
is all the more necessary since, contrary to Hong Kong, Taiwan forbids entities or individuals from mainland China from buying Taiwanese media without governmental approval.
Similarly, Taiwanese media cannot publish advertisements from the Chinese state. Beijing
thus needs to rely on local intermediaries.
This strategy of capture from within made headways during the presidency of
Ma Ying-jeou (KMT, 2008-2016) as he promoted a deeper economic integration
between Taiwan and mainland China. It facilitated the penetration of Taiwanese media
by Beijing and, incidentally, self-censorship. This was confirmed by subsequent reports on
global media freedom: Taiwan’s score has sharply deteriorated since 2008-2009118 – even
though it remains #1 in Asia. RSF’s choice of setting up its East Asian office in Taipei
was telling: Hong Kong had been an option until the Umbrella Revolution, after which
Reporters without Borders reconsidered its decision given Chinese interference.119
Huang Jaw-nian came up with a theoretical model to explain China’s influence on
Taiwanese media,120 combining the “commercialization of censorship” model
developed by Kurlantzick and Link121 and Wu Jieh-min (吳介民)’s “China Factor” model.122 According to the first, the CCP has not only used traditional methods, but also outsourced censorship to private media companies by threatening them when they refused to
comply, which increased the tendency of Chinese media to censor themselves. According
to the latter model, economic dependence is Beijing’s main tool of political influence on
other countries. Combining both, Huang Jaw-nian focuses on mechanisms through
which the Chinese government exports its censorship, including by outsourcing it
to foreign private media companies. He subsequently distinguished three steps: first,
make the target conntry economically dependent; then co-opt private media, either
providing services to them (financial and advertising resources, capitalization, access to the
Chinese market) or through threats to close them down; finally, implement and normalize self-censorship within the media landscape of these countries to shape the narrative
in favor of China. The author predicted that “a media company outside China will exercise
self-censorship on Chinese-sensitive topics when it becomes commercially tied with the
Chinese market”123 – an hypothesis that Huang confirmed by looking at Taiwan. Here, four
specific levers can be distinguished.

1. Access to the Chinese market
Taiwan became economically tied to China during the 2000s, and after the 2010
free trade agreement was signed. But the process had begun earlier: China has been
Taiwan’s main trade partner since 2005, replacing the U.S. and Japan, its first export
market since 2004 and the first investment market for Taiwanese businesses in 2002.
Simultaneously there has been an exponential growth in the number of organizations, associations, inter-strait forums in the economic and cultural fields. This environment has

facilitated the co-optation of Taiwanese media: most of them are attracted by the
enormous Chinese market whose access is conditioned to self-censorship. The Taiwan
Affairs Office (TAO) slowly gave access to some Chinese media such as the United Daily
News (UDN) which received an authorization to print and distribute its paper in the city of
Dongguan, and the China Times (→ p. 144). Huan Jaw-nian noted that “despite these privileges, the circulation of both Taiwanese newspapers in China has still been restricted to certain regions, organizations, and people, such as Taiwanese enterprises, foreign businesses,
five-star hotels, and academic institutions for Taiwan studies.”124 Conditionality is always in
order: Beijing only authorized the Taiwanese television channel TTV to set up its offices
in several Chinese cities, including Beijing, after it stopped broadcasting a show on Falun
Gong. This request immediately propelled self-censorship because, from that moment on,
“most Taiwanese media planning to enter the Chinese market became reluctant to produce
news reports and TV programs about Falun Gong.125”
This was not a matter of ideological convergence: even “green” media, that are pro-independence or, at least, in favor of a strengthened national identity, play along for commercial reasons. This is illustrated by the SET television channel, which was initially
pro-DPP and anti-CCP but began to censor itself after Ma’s election in 2008 because
the network’s president wished to expand its business in mainland China. A quantitative analysis confirmed that the number of stories on Tian’anmen, for example, has
continuously decreased since 2010.126 Besides, SET mainly airs Taiwanese TV shows – the
“Taiwanese drama,” a genre in its own right. But, to please Beijing, the network, which produces a majority of them in Mandarin, renamed them “Chinese drama” in December 2011.
This was not enough: Beijing demanded the cancellation of the very popular but
particularly anti-CCP show Big Talk News (大話新聞), broadcast on SET. This happened gradually: first, the show was barred from speaking about topics that irritated Beijing
(such as the Tian’anmen massacre, the Dalai-lama or Uyghur activist Rebiya Kadeer), from
inviting guests seen as subversive (such as Amnesty International Taiwan’s president, a
pro-Tibet activist) or simply from criticizing China. In the end, the network cancelled Big
Talk News in May 2012, showing that the “China factor” could lead to self-censorship and
even to the elimination of a popular TV show.127
Among pro-Chinese media, Master Chain (大師鏈) is interesting. The online media was
created in 2018 and based in Taipei: it was the first Taiwanese media accredited by the
Chinese government, authorized to set up an office and broadcast in mainland China. The
firm quickly expanded, going from 15 to 50 employees and recruiting with higher salaries than
the average in the sector thanks to a 100-million-dollar subvention from Hasdaq, a company
registered in the United States but headquartered in Hong Kong.128 Among the new recruits,
were former Taiwanese military and intelligence officers, including good “catches” such
as the former managing director of the National Safety Bureau Yang Kuo-chiang (楊國強)
– now a consultant for Master Chain – and the former director of the Military Intelligence

to abandon its activity in Taiwan on January 1st, 2020, after the anti-infiltration law precisely
aimed at countering Chinese interference on the island came into force.

2. Advertising
More or less covert advertising is another tool to shape Taiwanese narratives on
China. Since the late 2000s, the TAO and some provincial authorities in mainland China
have produced advertisings (to encourage doing business, or visiting China) for Taiwanese
media. UDN and the China Times have frequently published them, for instance, and the We
Want group even created an agency in Beijing (Want Want China Times Cultural Media
Agency) to serve as an intermediary for the Chinese government and place ads in other
Taiwanese media.130

3. Money
Participating in the capital of a company, and then taking control of it, by buying
up shares is the third tool: in the late 2000s, TAO “prepared a huge amount of capital, at
least US$300 million, with the clearly identified purpose of purchasing stock in Taiwanese
media companies such as Television Broadcasts Satellite (TVBS) channels and the UDN
Group’s affiliated institutions.”131 United Front agents apparently pressured Chinese companies into buying Taiwanese media companies, in exchange of a two-year tax exemption.
The United Front then places agents in the outlets so as to take control of their
editorial line.132

4. Buyouts by Taiwanese tycoons
Finally, a fourth lever is to encourage pro-Chinese tycoons – or tycoons who have
ties to the Chinese market – to buy Taiwanese media. This is what happened with
Want Want. Want Want Holdings Limited is a Taiwanese food company founded in 1962
by Tsai A-shi (蔡 阿賜). In 1987, the group went to his son Tsai Eng-meng (蔡衍明), who
massively invested in China after the martial law was lifted at the beginning of the 1990s.
The company created a Chinese branch in Shanghai, Want Want China Holdings, which is
now the most important branch of the group, and the biggest Chinese manufacturer of
rice crackers and flavored milk – and a global leader in the market. The group makes about
90% of its profits in the Chinese market,133 which is where the group’s president built his
fortune. Tsai Eng-meng, worth $6.6 billion nowadays, is the third richest man in Taiwan
despite mainly residing in Shanghai.134 His group reportedly received at least $586.7 million
in Chinese investment between 2004 and 2019.135 And Tsai Eng-meng returns the favor

by regularly making pro-China public statements. In 2012, he said to The Washington Post:
“[whether] you like it or not, unification is going to happen sooner or later. I really hope I
can see that,” while denying the Tian’anmen massacre.136
The group, which had initially been specialized in the food industry, decided to diversify its
activities by investing in the media. In 2006, it bought the Taiwanese television channel
CTV, and then the China Times Group in 2008. The China Times Group is the island’s
fourth biggest media conglomerate with its three dailies, including the China Times, which was
founded in 1950 and has the fourth largest circulation in the country, three magazines, three
TV channels – including CTi TV – and 8 news websites. It was subsequently renamed Want
Want China Times Group and is now led by one of Tsai Eng-meng’s sons, Tsai Shao-chung
(蔡紹中, president) and by KMT vice-president and former mayor of Taichung Jason Hu (
胡志強, vice-president). Want Want also created two platforms: another journal, Want Daily (
旺報) in 2009, and an English news website called the WantChinaTimes.com in 2010, which
takes up so many articles from the Chinese press agency Xinhua that the website was nicknamed the “representative of the Xinhua news agency in Taiwan.”137
“Since then, China Times has morphed from a mainstream publication into what
critics call a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist party”138 – or a so-called ‘Red’
media, i.e., one that covers Beijing’s narratives, attacks the DPP’s government and largely
censors itself. Hsu noted that even if self-censorship started before the newspaper was
taken over (the initially hostile China Times has gradually shifted in its attitude toward Beijing
since the mid-1990s),139 several elements showed that it has intensified since the buyup.
First, the newspaper’s archives were purged of any mention of the Tian’anmen massacre.140
The editorial line then changed: a comparison between articles published before and
after the purchase showed its impact, with a drastic decrease in human rights-related news
on China (two thirds fewer than before the purchase).141 Among the four biggest Taiwanese
newspapers, comparing the ones that accept advertising from Chinese authorities (China
Times and UDN) and the other two (Apple Daily and Liberty Times), we see that the former
groups has “a tendency to have a more positive and detailed coverage of information on
Chinese leaders and their official visits to Taiwan.” In the same vein, 100% and 77.78% of
articles published by the China Times and UDN on Xinjiang were based on official Chinese
sources only, and 100% and 83.33% of them blamed the conflict solely on protesters rather
than on the Chinese regime.142
Besides, the editorial team’s obedience to Beijing is clear, highlighted by the following
elements. First, the CCP’s Central Propaganda department was involved in Tsai’s
purchase of the China Times Group, through the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), which
is said to have intervened through a KMT leader to convince Tsai Eng-meng to buy the
group. At the time, the CCP feared that the group might be bought by the anti-communist
Next Media.143 Only two weeks after the purchase, Tsai instructed the China Times Group

managers to “strongly support the [KMT, pro-Beijing] Ma Ying-jeou administration, to
improve cross-Strait relations, and to avoid discussing unification and independence in the
Group’s media.”144 Two weeks later, Tsai met with Wang Yi, director of the PRC’s Taiwan
Affairs Office (now minister for Foreign Affairs) to “report” on the purchase and his plans
for the media group.145 Besides, within less than two years, the team covering the cross-strait
relationship was moved from the political division to the group’s headquarters in mainland
China, for the coverage of this sensitive topic to be directly controlled by the new executive
team, in other words by Beijing.146
Quickly, the journal parted ways with the authors of articles that had upset Beijing
– and incidentally upset Tsai. In one instance, a journalist who was writing an article on China
was also asked by his editor to first run it by the TAO.147 In March 2012, the China Times dedicated its cover to the promotion of the Fujian governor’s visit to Taiwan. It was later revealed
that the journal was following a document called “Propaganda plan for the Fujian governor’s tour in Taiwan in 2012” (福建省长访台宣传计画) that the province’s authorities had
handed out in advance and that went so far as to plan the number of words needed for each
article that the newspaper had to publish on the event.148 For this propaganda work, the group
was paid through its intermediary in Beijing (Want Want China Times Cultural Media).149 But
it ultimately cost more to the group because the coverage sparked outrage and an investigation from the Mainland Affairs Council (the agency in charge of relations with mainland
China). The journal was fined 1.8 million Taiwanese dollars (€53,200).150 It was criticized for
disguising advertising texts paid by Beijing (advertorials, infomercials) as news and
for working as an intermediary for Beijing to purchase spots in other newspapers – which is
also illegal in Taiwan.151 In 2019, it was revealed that the editorial managers of the China
Times and CTi TV were getting their instructions from the TAO in Beijing: “[they] call
every day,” said one China Times reporter. “They do not meddle in everything, mainly topics
related to cross-Strait relations and to China. They have a say in the angle of the story, and
whether it goes on the front page.”152
The Want Want group is also involved in the dissemination of fake news. For example,
in July 2012, when hundreds of students protested against Want Want’s project of purchasing parts of Next Media, which would have further increased Beijing’s hold over Taiwanese
media, Want Want accused researcher Huand Kuo-chang of paying the students to protest,
but it admitted a month later that this claim was not supported by any proof.153 Anti-Want
Want protests intensified (thousands of people took to the streets on September 1), and
the international protest campaign became international, thus prompting Tsai to give up.
Furthermore, the group also organizes meetings and cross-strait cultural forums with
Chinese organizations, associations and think tanks suspected of being tied to the United
Front Work Department (UFWD) or to the PLA’s political warfare units.154

Finally, the group’s media outlets give maximal coverage to pro-Chinese candidates during electoral campaigns. CTV and CTi TV ensured an uninterrupted coverage
of pro-Beijing candidate Han Kuo-yu – for the Kaohsiung mayoral election (2018), for the
KMT primaries (2019), and for the presidency (2020) – contributing to the creation of a
“Han Wave” (→ p. 460). CTi TV was actually fined one million Taiwanese dollars (€29,500)
by the National Communications Commission (NCC), the public authority regulating the
media, because it found that CTi TV had given too much airtime to Han, violating principles of fairness and equal speaking time.155
In 2017 and 2020, CTi News itself was the subject of 30% of all complaints to the
NCC, which decided not to renew its broadcasting license in November 2020 after
observing many cases of “disinformation” and traces of “external interference.”
The NCC had never taken such a decision since its creation in 2006.156 The Taiwan
Supreme Administrative Court rejected the network’s appeal and CTi News ceased to
broadcast on Taiwanese cable television (Channel 52) on December 11, 2020. It remains
available online however.
Want Want’s example has been emulated: knowing how beneficial China Times’ purchase was to Tsai, because Beijing granted him favors. Other Taiwanese tycoons have
become involved in the media, with the sole goal of pleasing Beijing and using that
relationship to make profits for their companies in other sectors. Taiwanese smartphone-maker HTC thus took control of the TVBS Media group, which runs four national
and one international TV channels. It did so by buying a high number of shares in 2011 and
then by becoming majority shareholder in 2015. Furthermore, the Taiwanese group Ting
Hsin, specialized in food production (biggest producer of instant noodles in China) also
bought one of the biggest companies of cable TV, China Network System (CNS), in 2014.
At the time, CNS ran eleven channels.157

5. Other levers
The other available levers of influence include clandestine funding (some
Taiwanese groups have been paid to occasionally publish some articles that fit Beijing’s
interests: for instance, the TAO presumably paid RMB30,000 (€3,800) for two articles)158;
appointments to key positions (a CTi TV journalist explained that the way a number of
Taiwanese media cover China was “organized” by representatives of the Chinese state who
appointed China-based correspondents to editorial positions);159 and the organization of
bilateral forums such as the Cross-Strait Media People Summit (兩岸媒體人峰會/兩
岸媒體人北京峰會) created in 2015. During its fourth edition in Beijing, in 2019, more
than 70 representatives of Taiwanese media were told that it was their “duty” to promote
Chinese culture and the reunification with China.160

B. Private cyber-armies
Cyber-armies are groups of individuals that can be recruited to conduct campaigns
for or against an entity or a person. This “post-helpers” (貼文小幫手) business, which
consists in creating fake accounts and fake articles, has grown a lot in Taiwan during the past
decade. It is also accessible to all budgets (“[you] could hire an Internet army for NTD
10,000 [$330] a month”).161 Initially used by companies to promote their products,162 this
process can be used for political purposes. Some agencies are specialized in political
campaining, like AutoPolitical, which has worked all over Asia. Its slogan is “win an election with artificial intelligence.” There is also a black market for social media accounts, sold
to the highest bidders, where the most followed and oldest accounts are the most expensive
(→ p. 376), PTT accounts for instance.163 Because they act through local agencies, it is not
always easy to trace them back to foreign contractors and to prove an interference.

C. Politics
1. Political parties
The KMT has become less important to Beijing since it lost power: “more and more
you will hear voices in the CCP who also claim that the KMT is no longer the counterpart
that they were banking on for unification with Taiwan.”164 For that reason, Beijing tries
to diversify its channels of influence. In this instance, three small pro-unification
political parties are used as local intermediaries by Beijing:
• The New Party (NP – 新黨), created in 1993. Its spokesperson Wang Ping-chung
(王炳忠), his father, and two executives of the Party’s Youth were found guilty of
espionage on behalf of China in June 2018 due to their implication in an operation
led by the Chinese citizen Zhou Hongxu (周泓旭) – also charged with espionage in
September 2017. The small group, which called itself the “secret Star Fire unit,” created a website (Fire News) to recruit Taiwanese people, including civil servants. They
tried to obtain classified documents through members of the Taiwanese military,
mostly on armament programs. Investigations discovered evidence of money transfers
from mainland China and a document on which Wang Ping-chung wrote “I work under
the guidance and assistance of the CCP to help the forces working to achieve unification
across the Taiwan Strait.”165 This indictment clearly did not deter the NP from building
a closer relationship with Beijing, as the party announced its intention to open a liaison
office in mainland China right after the conviction.166
• The Chinese Unification Promotion Party (CUPP – 中華統一促進黨) created
in 2005. It was created by Chang An-le (張安樂), a man with a sultry reputation who

became famous for his ties to organized crime. Known as the “White Wolf,”167 he was
a leader of the Bamboo Connection (竹聯幫) gang, one of the largest Taiwanese triads,
which also operates in the United States. Chang An-le was arrested there in 1985 under
several charges including murder and drug trafficking. After serving a ten-year sentence
in a U.S. prison, he came back to Taiwan where he quickly became involved in a case
of corruption, which led him to flee to mainland China where he stayed for ten years.
According to J. Michael Cole, that was when Chang An-le spent time with several “Red
princes” including Hu Shiying (胡石英), who is said to be part of Xi Jinping’s “close
circle.”168 He then founded the CUUP from China, and its Taiwanese branch in 2005.
He came back in Taiwan in 2013 and was briefly arrested. He was arrested again in
August 2019, charged with several offences including having received tens of thousands
of dollars from China, which is illegal in Taiwan under the Political Donations Act.169
Some suspect that the CUPP, like other pro-Beijing political groups, receives
money from Beijing through Chinese companies, including those tied to the Taolue
group (韜略集團) but also from criminal organizations (the Bamboo Connection and
the Four Seas (四海幫)),170 networks of Buddhist temples and various United Front
organizations in the area and in the world.171 The CUPP also created several cross-strait
groups such as the Tainan Cross-Strait Exchange Promotion Association (台南市兩岸
交流協 會) and the Cross-Strait Taiwan Guangdong Exchange Association (台粵交流
協會會), whose final goal is to circumvent the Taiwanese government.172 The CUPP
is presumably also used as an intermediary for Taiwanese companies that wish to settle
in China and ensure that “ideological conditions” will be met by incoming companies.173
• The Home Party (HP – 紅黨)174 created in 2017, which aims, among other things,
to “uniting the majority of Taiwanese farmers and fishermen” (統合廣大農漁工)175
– key populations in the Taiwanese political landscape (and historically swayed by the
KMT), who are regularly targeted by disinformation campaigns that, for example, discredit the agricultural policies of the DPP (→ p. 465). The HP was involved in at least
two cases that showed its role in Chinese influence operations on the island. The first
was a recruitment campaign, active since at least 2017, for the Taiwan Elite Class of
the Communist Party School of the Fujian Province (中共党校福建省委党校台湾社
会菁英班).176 The school “serves as an incubator of the central government,” and
its teachers come from Beijing-based think tanks affiliated with the CCP. Student were
expected to identify as Chinese and to support the One China policy. The second case
occurred in April 2019, when the HP co-organized an event in Taichung called “2019

two organizations from the United Front (the China Council for the Promotion of
Peaceful Reunification (CPPRC, 中國和平統一促進會 (台灣)) and the China Peace
Development Association (中華和平發展促進會)). The slogan of this event, which
was eventually cancelled, was: “Proclaim the 1992 consensus, support peace and unification” (宣揚九二 共識、支持和平、支持統一).177

2. Individuals
In addition to investing in political parties, Beijing also invests in individuals –
politicians noticed for their potential or existing pro-Chinese inclinations and for
their more-or-less strategic positions in the Taiwanese political landscape. Members
of parliament, mayors, and advisors of various political backgrounds are invited on allexpense-paid, usually luxurious trips to mainland China where they meet CCP executives for instance. They are then expected to implement policies in favor of Beijing at their
respective levels.
Granting access to a special economic zone is one of the methods used to capture the political elite and/or their family members, thus offering preferential conditions to foreign companies. Cole reported that Beijing used this technique to “capture”
Lin Kuo-ching (林 國慶), a former DPP politician who became independent and stood
out in October 2019 when he said that “no one likes Taiwan more than Xi Jinping.” This
declaration was surprising but probably explained by the fact that his son Lin Chih-yuan (
林智遠) owns a company operating in the Pingtan free-trade zone. He is also the assistant
general manager of the Pingtan Free Trade Zone Cross-Strait Development Co. (平潭自
貿區兩岸發展公司) and has been active within the Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference.178

D. Influencers and other intermediaries
1. Groups and prominent figures on the cultural and artistic scenes
Beijing has, at the very least, two different tools in this area. First, using Chinese artists
or cultural events as relays: Chinese artists that tour Taiwan can be used as vectors
of “political warfare,” through the propaganda that they can spread or the contacts
they can make. J. Michael Cole explained that the events themselves are usually not problematic, but they are used as a cover or opportunity to carry out other operations: “when
they organize Chinese singing competitions, or concerts at National Taiwan University, it’s
not the songs that they’re singing that are a threat to Taiwanese society, it’s the individuals
who are organizing the event […] coming to Taiwan and using their time off to interact
with other individuals and hopefully recruit some Taiwanese, or co-opt them.”179
Taipei is aware of that risk and has already barred some individuals from visiting – such
as Liu Qi (刘奇), who introduced himself as the leader of an art group planning to per177. Ibid.

form in Taiwan in November 2019. Liu was also the director of the Cultural Department
of a United Front organization, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese
(ACFROC, 中华全国归国华侨联合会).180 Cole also mentionned the Shanghai-Taipei
“Sing! China” music festival, which was planned at National Taiwan University (NTU) in
September 2017 and co-organized by the city of Taipei and several cultural organizations
in Shanghai. The event was actually devised to promote “the peaceful unification of the
motherland,” as one Shanghai organization described on its website.181 The Chinese counterpart even made a request, which was eventually granted: they wanted the “National
Taiwan University” renamed as “Taipei City Taiwan University” in promotional material.182
The event was eventually cancelled following student protests, but similar events had taken
place on other campuses in the preceding weeks and years.
Second, Beijing can also use the Chinese market as a lever to control Taiwanese
artists. There, as often, both the carrot and the stick are used. The carrot: Beijing identifies Taiwanese celebrities on TV, invites them to China and explains that, over there, their
salary can be between 5 and 10 times higher. The stick: members of the Taiwanese cultural industry identified as hostile to the CCP are denounced and often targeted by
naming and shaming campaigns on social networks, which push them to apologize and
publicly recognize that they identify as Chinese, or else they risk seeing their contracts, tours
and shows cancelled. Access to the huge Chinese market being important, even vital, for
much of the cultural industry, Beijing thus succeeds in whipping them back in line, and in
some cases in turning Taiwanese actors, singers and models into real ambassadors
for the CCP.183

2. Civic organizations

Besides, Beijing uses “civic organizations” such as the Concentric Patriotism Association
(中華愛國同心會) – which, along with its secretary general Chang Hsiu-yeh (張秀葉),
openly advocates for reunification184 – that defend the CCP’s interests down to the
streets of Taiwan, sometimes violently attacking targets such as Falun Gong members
and pro-democracy and pro-independence activists.185 These organizations are also used to
mobilize people for protests, even paying them (between 800 and 900 Taiwanese dollars

Some temples are suspected of contributing to the United Front’s activities. An article
published in Mirror Media on October 2, 2019 revealed that yearly pilgrimages, including
one dedicated to the goddess Mazu, are reportedly used as a cover for agents to organize meetings, transfer Chinese funds for United Front activities and to pressure

uncooperative temples.187 About thirty temples, mostly in the south of the island, are presumably involved. The article explained that these temples had been infiltrated by members
of the Chinese Unification Promotion Party, led by Chang An-le. However, according to
a study by Luo Cheng-tsung,188 a professor at the Southern Taiwan University for Science
and Technology, the 30 mentioned temples are only minor temples with little influence.
According to him, attention should be paid to the main temples on the island, which are
also under the influence of the CCP.
In June-July 2017, a campaign accused President Tsai and her government of “persecuting religion” and rapidly grew in intensity. The rumor specifically targeted the network of
Buddhist and Taoist temples, with false announcements, such as a fake news announcing
that the government would prohibit incense.189

4. The business community
The Taishang (臺商) – businesspersons working in mainland China – are important intermediaries for Beijing, not solely because of their sheer number, but also because
of their economic and political weight. Some of them, members of local CCP branches or
of United Front organizations, participate in Chinese influence operations.

5. Members of the military
Senior officers and retired generals, especially freshly-retired generals, are a prime
target for Beijing, because they are knowledgeable on Taiwanese defense capacities and the
organization of its armed forces, and because they have a high-level network of still-active
promotion comrades who have reached the highest levels of the hierarchy. These young
retirees are thus invited to China to participate in ceremonies, where they embody the One
China policy (in November 2016, the presence of 32 former Taiwanese officers singing the
Chinese anthem at a memorial ceremony in China stirred a controversy), or to various events,
during which sports or culture are useful opportunities to organize meetings.
Between the summers of 2009 and 2011, at least twelve such events took place in China.
For example, from June 1 to June 6, 2011, Chinese and Taiwanese retired military officers
attended a golf tournament in Sichuan, visited the area hit by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and held a seminar on cross-strait relations in Beijing.190 Other meetings do not
even pretend to be cultural or sports events and get straight to the point: in April
2010, retired general Hsu Li-Nung (許歷農), the former director of the department
of political warfare of the Taiwanese army led a delegation of twenty former officers through a trip in Beijing and Shanghai where they met, among others, “State
Council Taiwan Affairs Office Director Wang Yi, Politburo Standing Committee Member
Jia Qinglin (贾庆林) and CMC Vice-Chairman General Xu Caihou (徐才厚).”191 More

rarely, these meetings take place in Taiwan (in May 2010, about fifty former officers
from Taiwan and around sixty former PLA officers met up in Taipei for a “cross-Strait
friendship conference”192). The also target intelligence services: in December 2010,
“Lieutenant General Hsu Ping-chiang of the National Security Bureau (NSB) and Major
General Huang Chi-mei of the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) – led a delegation of 17
retired MIB officials on a trip to China.”193
These ties between both straits are often maintained by the Whampoa Military Academy
Alumni Association (黄埔军校) – founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1924; the military academy
has trained generals from both the nationalist and the communist sides of the Strait.194 Yet,
this alumni association is actually a United Front organization operated by the UFWD.
Hence, meetings between Chinese and Taiwanese officers are anything but spontaneous:
they are simply one of the United Front’s many programs.
Beijing uses these meetings to create a network and solidify its influence, even
inside the Taiwanese armed forces and intelligence services. It also sometimes
uses them to destabilize the Taiwanese public opinion. It was thus revealed that, at a
mundane event in Beijing, Hsia Ying-chou (夏瀛洲), a retired general from the Taiwanese
armed forces, and former NDU President, reportedly said that “[from] now on, we should
no longer separate the ROC Army (ROC meaning Taiwan) and the PLA. We are all China’s
army.”195 Hsia Ying-chou denied saying this. Regardless, Beijing achieved its goal by convincing Taiwan, where a controversy erupted, that such outbursts were at least possible.
Following the story, President Ma asked the Ministry of Defense to prepare a code of
conduct for retired generals visiting China.196

New legislative dispositions were adopted in 2019 to avoid compromising situations
like these: retired generals and highlevel officials, such as vice-ministers, who participate in
political events in China, can now lose their pension (or fined up to 10 million Taiwanese
dollars – €295,500 – if their pensions were paid in one installment when they retired).

6. YouTubers
Everywhere in the world, YouTubers have become a main channel for information
for young audiences. Cognizant of this, Beijing tries to control their impact on
Chinese public opinion, and to use them to attack Taiwan. During the last presidential
campaign, for instance, after YouTuber Potter King (波特王) filmed a show with President
Tsai, his Chinese partner Papitube asked him to delete it, criticizing him for calling Tsai
“President” (a forbidden label in China, which uses “Taiwan leader” to avoid implying that
Taiwan is a sovereign state). Potter King refused, thus ending the contract that allowed him
to broadcast in China. Papitube said it “strongly rebukes any action which undermines the
nation’s (China) dignity.”197 After the incident, the YouTuber was also unable to access his
Weibo account, where he had a million fans.198
Beijing also tries to recruit Taiwanese people to influence the Taiwanese public opinion while covering its tracks, especially after the scandal around the Chinese
YouTuber posing as a Taiwanese person (→ p. 467). They are reportedly trained by
the PLA (both in terms of their technical skills and in terms of the content they will produce).199

7. Disgruntled individuals
Generally, Beijing targets those in Taiwan who can become spokespersons because they
have influence, but it also looks for those who are motived because they are unhappy with
the current political order. For instance, and not unlike Canada or Australia, Aboriginals,
or “First Nations,” are prime targets as they are regularly neglected by authorities. In Taiwan,
Beijing targets aboriginal media and young people aspiring to a better life, but also
disappointed shop owners in distressed areas, such as in the touristic sectors areas. To
counter Beijing’s strategy of controlling the number of tourists to pressure the island, the
government’s diversification strategy has been a success in recent years. It compensates
the loss of Chinese tourists with a higher number of tourists from Japan and from Gulf
countries especially, who also have a greater purchasing power. Tourism was doing well
before being impacted by the pandemic, in ways similar to tourism all around the world.
Nevertheless, because Chinese tourists visited specific areas not always toured by new tourists, some tour-operators, gift shops, restaurants and other local shops in these areas were
upset by the development. Hence, they are prime targets for Chinese influence operations
attacking the Taiwanese government. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that most
of these areas are in the south, where local authorities are more sympathetic to China to
begin with.

8. Overseas Taiwanese people
Reaching inside Taiwan also means reaching outside of the island; Beijing targets the
Taiwanese diaspora all over the world, starting with Taiwanese people living in
China (presumably over 1 million people). They were mostly left alone under Hu Jintao.
But, under Xi Jinping, they are increasingly relied upon and mobilized against Taiwan.200

9. Chinese people living in Taiwan
Conversely, Beijing also look at Chinese citizens in Taiwan, or at people of
Chinese origin on the island, as potential relays. The business community is the most
obvious interlocutor. Wives are among the less obvious (and less scrutinized) relays: 70%
of Chinese people who become Taiwanese citizens are women. This can be explained by
the relative low competitiveness of middle-class Taiwanese men on the Taiwanese marriage
market, which means that these men sometimes go to China or Vietnam to find spouses.
Hence, women can become relays, but they must be accounted for individually, as they do
not form an organized group and they cannot trigger mass movements of their own.

III. Information manipulation
In its outward appearances, the Chinese strategy of information manipulation in Taiwan
roughly follows the same pattern: fake or biased information “first appearing in Chinese
state- or party-controlled media is then spread via Chinese social media. The disinformation
is subsequently injected into the Taiwan media environment via social media – PTT board
(a Taiwanese bulletin board system), Facebook fan pages, and closed groups – and is finally
picked up and legitimized by traditional media.”201 Facebook is the most widely used
social network (nearly 79.6% of Taiwanese people, a world record which explains why
Facebook “has been a very important playground for disinformation in Taiwan”202).
Facebook is ahead of YouTube (72.6%) and LINE, which is the most prominently used
instant messaging application (98.5%), way ahead of Facebook Messenger (48.2%).203
2,400 disinformation attacks are carried out daily on Facebook solely, “all of them
originating from China,” and aiming to undermine Taiwanese democracy and its
institutions.204 They are all meticulously planned, with spikes of disinformation occurring
between 7 and 9 a.m., when Taiwanese people are in public transports using their phones.
During a parliamentary hearing in May 2019, lieutenant general Vincent Chen (陳文凡),
deputy director of the National Security Bureau, confirmed that a few Taiwanese media
had adopted Beijing’s editorial line (he described them as “complying media” (同路媒體)),
and operated on a number of platforms (print or online press, social media) to spread disinformation in Taiwan. The NSB said these operations were part of cognitive warfare (认
知 作战) in that they aim to shape a narrative that fits with Beijing’s interests.205 Chen did

not reveal the names of these media, a decision that was criticized, including by KMT representative Lu Yui-ling (呂玉玲), but it could be interpreted as a warning shot sent to these
media companies.206 He however insisted on problems stemming from the purchase
of Facebook fan pages and social influencers by Beijing and confirmed that some
Taiwanese media were asking Beijing for approval before publishing opinion pieces.207
The credibility of people spreading disinformation is at stake. How to earn the trust
of the targets? One of the main methods is to pretend to be a direct witness, someone speaking from experience (at Kansai airport, for example, in the case of typhoon
Jebi → p. 456). Another method is to institutionalize fake information, by making it
seem like it comes from government officials, sometimes counterfeiting documents
to legitimate the information.208 By the time the information is verified, and the government issues a denial, the damage has already been done.
In terms of substance, these stories mainly revolve around four topics. First, the
(DPP) government is painted as unable to work efficiently, not providing for the needs
of its population, its protection… Some ad hominem attacks also target the president and
members of the ruling majority. Second, they discuss Taiwan’s relationship to China
(its independence), which is the key question defining the Taiwanese identity. Here, we
obtained contradictory information from our interviews: for some, Chinese operations nurture both sides of the debate, pro-unification and pro-independence alike, because they aim
to divide the society rather than to impose a narrative, mirroring what the Russians did in
the United States and in Europe (→ p. 620).209 For others, Beijing differs from Moscow as
it only supports unification and always discredits independence and the DPP. Third, they
focus on divisive societal topics that include agriculture (spreading rumors on falling
prices), labor (a government allegedly pushing people to work more and earn less), LGBT
rights and gay marriage (society is divided along generational lines here, with young people
being more favorable, older and more religious people opposed to it), nuclear power, economic problems (particularly low wages; unemployment is not an issue in itself), pensions,
etc. Immigration is among other controversial topics that could be used in the future, but
it has been relatively left aside for now. Fourth, the stories emphasize diplomatic relations and Taiwan’s uncertain position on the international stage (→ p. 476).
Of course, the narratives are adapted to different targets: the government’s economic
failure and the lack of a future in Taiwan for young people (Taiwan is presented as a
ghost island, see box below); the agricultural crisis, insecurity, health issues… to old people
(harder to reach because they are less connected).

The ghost island narrative
One of the most common narratives used by Beijing to weaken and divide the Taiwanese
society is the ghost island narrative (鬼岛): Taiwan is portrayed as having nothing to offer
to its youth (low salaries, no professional opportunities).210 Beijing nourishes that story, not
only by spreading messages on social media (there is even a namesake Facebook group,211 and
forums on which young Chinese people discuss the topic). They also organize a brain drain:
the China’s State Council Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) disclosed in early March 2018 “31
incentives” (对台31项措 施) to attract companies and Taiwanese individuals to come live in
mainland China, by pushing for the distribution of Taiwanese cultural products (movies, television programs, books) in China, for example, or by having authors receive training in China
or become members of Chinese professional organizations.212 In November 2019, 26 new
measures were added to the list, 13 for companies and 13 for individuals.

A. The Typhoon Jebi Affair: when disinformation kills
This is a rare example of information manipulation that indirectly
led to someone’s death; the incident “was a turning point in the
understanding of information manipulation in Taiwan and
their capacity to inflict damages.”213
Category 5 typhoon Jebi was the most violent typhoon to
hit Japan since 1993. It hit the Kansai region on September 4,
2018. Consequently, Kansai International Airport, not far from
Osaka, was severely flooded, grounding more than 3,000 persons, including 750 Chinese and 500 Taiwanese citizens. On
day later, at 12:23pm, a Weibo account named “Baby flooding
beast” (洪水猛兽baby) posted a message stating that the Chinese embassy was “sending chartered buses to evacuate Chinese travelers” and ending with “I spontaneously
feel pride and cannot help to have tears in my eyes. China, I love you!” while tagging the
Xinhua press agency, the People’s Daily (人民日报) and the Communist Youth League
to attract their attention. Three hours later, the Chinese website Guancha (观察者 网)
published an article untitled “750 Chinese citizens blocked at a Japanese airport, the
powerful motherland comes to rescue them” which stated that the general consulate in
Osaka had sent 15 buses to evacuate Chinese travelers. The article cited the aforementioned message from “Baby flooding beast” as well as Weibo account users claiming to
have been among the Chinese people evacuated from the airport. According to those
messages, Taiwanese people who wanted to get on the bus were told that they could

benefit from this service from the “motherland” if they felt Chinese (觉得自己是中
国人就能上车).214 Official Chinese media picked up the story.215
The story reached Taiwanese social media the following morning, first via Professional
Technology Temple (PTT), the most popular online forum in Taiwan. An account
named “czqs2000” posted a message titled “Does anyone have information on Chinese
passengers getting preferential access to buses in Kansai international airport?” Other
users shared articles from Guancha and the Global Times. Following this, the daily tabloid Taiwan Apple Daily (蘋果日報) published a message initially titled “The Chinese
embassy sent buses to pick up Chinese passengers at the Kansai airport and asked
Taiwanese people to declare themselves as Chinese to get on the bus.”216 Two hours
later, a PTT account user under the name “GuRuGuRu” claimed to be a Taiwanese
traveler stuck at the airport the previous day, and said she was able to get on a bus
sent by China without having to identify as Chinese. She added that she had contacted
the Taiwan Representative Office in Osaka but did not receive any help. Her message
was extensively shared and discussed on Taiwanese social media. On September 14,
Su Chii-cherng, (蘇啟誠), a Taiwanese diplomat and managing director of the
Osaka branch of Taipei’s Economic and Cultural Bureau committed suicide, hanging
himself at his home in Japan. He left a letter in which he said he could not bear the
humiliation and public criticism that accused his bureau of not doing enough for
his fellow citizens blocked at the airport.
The following day, TFC published an investigation showing that all these stories were
based on a false premise: in reality, and as was confirmed by a spokesperson of the Kansai
airport, the Chinese consulate never sent buses to pick up Chinese citizens.217 The
buses were chartered by Japanese authorities for all passengers, without distinction. The
Chinese consulate had indeed asked to send its own buses, but its request was rejected by
the Japanese authorities.218 Airport authorities moved the passengers to a transit terminal
in a mall in the city of Izumisano, 11.6 km away from the airport. And it is there that the
Chinese consulate sent its buses, which picked up Chinese citizens, but no Taiwanese citizen (not the 1044 “Chinese” people, including 32 Taiwanese, claimed by the Chinese consulate).219 During the airport’s evacuation, staff members from the China Southern Airline
company gathered Chinese citizens in one of the buses, but it had not been sent by the
consulate.
Hence, a controversy was allowed to grow for a dozen days, leading to one death,
as none of the Taiwanese media involved in the scandal bothered to check the
initial information: they simply took anonymous online testimonies for granted, without being suspicious. Political figures such as KMT’s Arthur Chen (陳宜民) were also
instrumental in spreading the Chinese narrative. On September 17, the Taiwanese media
watchdog (National Communications Commission, NCC) intervened and sent a warning
to several televisions channels and online media who had not verified information in this
story. In reality, the case showed that “the Taiwanese society in 2018 was generally

not aware of the [risk posed by] disinformation operations.”220 This incident made
the population and social platforms more aware of disinformation as both serious
and potentially lethal. It was evident for PTT, which stopped registering new accounts
for some time afterward.
In December 2019, Taiwanese influencer Slow Yang (楊蕙如), who built her wealth
in the credit card business, and Tsai Fu-ming (蔡福明), were charged for having organized online harassment against Su Chii-cherng by paying several Internet users to
insult him.221
While Taiwanese media bear a huge responsibility in this story, its origin remains
suspicious. A rather common incident was transformed into an issue tied to the Taiwanese
identity by an article from Guancha, which spread the (false) news that Taiwanese people had
to identify as Chinese to get on buses reportedly chartered by the Chinese authorities. But
Guancha “operates under Beijing’s Central Network Security and Information Committee
Office.”222 The “czqs2000” account then spread the rumor on Taiwanese networks by posting it on PTT. This is not irrefutable evidence, but its IP address (221.219.231.115) is based
in Beijing and is apparently owned by a Chinese press photographer.223 Moreover, there
was a “grouped publication” phenomenon on Facebook, found in many other disinformation cases, including during electoral campaigns, which consists in groups of fan pages
publishing at about the same time or within very similar time frames.224 This highlights a
possibly coordinated campaign, further signaling its potential state origin. To sum up, this
fake story, designed to become viral in Taiwan, was presumably fabricated in China,
spread by Chinese relays, introduced in Taiwan by a Chinese Internet user and then
circulated on Taiwanese social networks, including on Facebook, in a coordinated
fashion. For all these reasons, this could be a Chinese disinformation operation in
which Taiwanese media, because of their incompetence, were objectively Chinese
allies.

B. Electoral interference
Not only does Beijing continue to rely on the permanent networks described in this
chapter, it also intensifies its efforts during key moments of the Taiwanese democratic
life, particularly during electoral campaigns. Electoral interference mainly takes two shapes.
First, covert financial support for selected candidates: “[such] funds are believed to be
made available through Hong Kong, through ‘dual use’ Chinese companies, via Taiwanese
companies with a presence in China, and in the form of hard cash brought by couriers (e.g.,
businesspeople on visits across the Taiwan Strait).”225 Second, it is evident in the numerous
information manipulations.

There was a peak in information manipulations during the municipal elections organized on November 24, 2018, and which were largely won by the KMT. It was highlighted
by a study of more than 5,000 messages reported to the Cofacts platform as being potentially false during the four months preceding the elections, and one month after.226 Taiwan
has always been the target of influence and disinformation operations emanating from
mainland China, but they were particularly intense in this instance: “Taiwan’s 2018 election
was the first time for this island to be massively attacked by fake news or disinformation.”227
There are probably a few reasons explaining this intensity: President Tsai’s election two
years earlier put an end to the KMT’s political dominance and redefined Taiwan’s relation
to China. This election, which was largely perceived as a referendum on the president,
questioned the national identity. Finally, the President was unpopular (her approval rate
had fallen from 70% to 30%), mostly because of reforms on divisive issues – gay marriage,
labor rights, pensions, etc. – some of which were at the center of a multiple-choice referendum on the day of the election. These controversial topics were logically instrumentalized
during the electoral campaign. Minister Lo Ping-chen (羅秉成), who was in charge of the
fight against disinformation, said that “on the gay marriage issue – this policy was distorted
to such an extent that [it claimed] there will be no more moms and dads after such a referendum was passed.”228
Two months before the election, the Ministry of Justice’s Investigation Bureau (法務
部調查 局) released a communiqué claiming to have “unequivocal evidence” of the
Chinese government’s interference in the campaign through content farms producing divisive fake news to divide the Taiwanese society.229 It also investigated 33
cases of suspected Chinese financial contributions to Taiwanese candidates.230 The
National Security Bureau (NSB) speaks of “media and psychological warfare” against the
island, which it compared to the Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. It detected
“many content farms, many bots and purchases of ‘likes’ coming from China and supporting pro-Chinese candidates only, through private companies.”231 “It costs 5,000 Taiwanese
dollars to buy 1,000 logins, and the price rises during election campaigns. Some accounts
change their IP addresses every day,” a member of government explained, adding that “the
most common modus operandi was the spreading of fake news on social media, on Facebook
and on LINE, before they got picked up by conventional media. We also saw usurpated IP
addresses, fake accounts, and attempts to provoke or accentuate divisions between people
who were pro and anti-China.”232 It also seems that illegal bets played a role too: “the likelihood of high returns if a certain candidate is elected could encourage bettors to call upon
their friends and families to vote for the candidate in question.”233

Many irregularities were found in the campaign for the country’s second biggest
city, Kaohsiung (2.8 million inhabitants). For two decades, the city was controlled by the
DPP, which won the previous elections with 68% of the votes. The incumbent mayor,
Chen Chu (陳菊) held the record of political longevity in the country after 1945 (20062018). This time, she was facing a KMT candidate, pro-Beijing Han Kuo-yu, whose populist style, such as the slogan “Make Kaohsiung Rich and Great” won him the nickname of
the Taiwanese Trump, save for the fact that, unlike Trump he had largely been unknown
months before the vote. His meteoric rise, which led him to be elected mayor, may
have been greatly helped by Beijing. At first, there were a few suspicious signs. His
social media accounts had a level of “community engagements” (an aggregate of likes,
comments, and shares across the Internet) many times higher than all of the other KMT
candidates combined.234 His Facebook account in particular prompted suspicions. His
official page’s popularity growth was spectacular, it gained 225,882 “likes” and 235,038
followers in less than a month, three times more than his DPP opponent and higher than
the national average (around 12,000 “likes” and followers).235 The page had about half a
million followers at the end of the campaign – twice as many as his DPP opponent, Chen,
whose page was filled with insults and hateful comments.
A Facebook group supporting him named “Han Kuo-yu Fans for Victory! Holding
up a Blue Sky!” (韓國瑜粉絲後援團 必勝! 撐起一片藍天), created just one day after
Han declared his candidacy, played an important role in the campaign. With around
61,000 members at the time of the election, it became a hub offering many resources
(talking points, memes, fake news discrediting the DPP opponent, etc.) to Han supporters.
Yet, it was later established that this group had not been created by actual fans of the
candidates, but rather “created, managed, and nurtured by what looks very much
like a professional cybergroup from China.”236 Three of its admins, involved from
the beginning, were suspicious accounts which turned completely inactive a day after
the election. The LinkedIn profiles linked to these accounts exhibited stereotypical patterns
and displayed the exact same characteristics as 249 other accounts: same description
in simplified Chinese characters, similar mugshot-style photos that could have been cropped
from decades-old graduation pictures, all claiming to be Tencent employees and Peking
University graduates.237 Some even used the same photo under different names, thus
confirming the fraud. Paul Huang, who uncovered the operation, added that “LinkedIn
is known to be one of Beijing’s favorite playgrounds for conducting espionage and
influence operations.”238 Numerous cases revealed in the United States,239 in Germany,240
or in France,241 showed Beijing to be capable and used to creating hundreds or thousands of accounts to scout, approach – and potentially recruit – targets, which is easier on LinkedIn, where people are usually looking for professional opportunities. Besides,
LinkedIn is the only major American social media allowed in China.242

Another element pointing to Chinese interference came after the fact, with the defection
of Wang Liqiang (王立强), who claims he had been an intelligence officer and asked
Australia for political asylum in November 2019. His confession should be taken with
a pinch of salt, but he claimed to have participated in influence operations against
Taiwan during the 2018 elections by creating 200,000 fake accounts on social media
and offering no less than 1.5 billion yuan (€188.5 million) to Taiwanese media to
promote Han Kuo-yu’s campaign against President Tsai.243 Based on the data released by
Wang, two people he named were arrested in Taiwan for being Chinese agents.
Finally, regarding the extent to which fake news spread during this campaign actually
reached their goals – whether or not they really influenced the electors’ opinions – a survey
carried out immediately after the vote, on a sample of 1,068 voters, highlighted the two
most influential fake news: that President Tsai did not leave her armored vehicle and “hid”
behind armed soldiers as she visited a region that had suffered from heavy floods in 2018;
and the typhoon Jebi affair (→ p. 456). The study also showed that the voters who were
the most influenced were politically independent. That year, a majority of them voted for
the KMT.244
Largely perceived as a referendum on the government and as a general repetition for the
January 2020 general elections, the 2018 municipal elections were also an eye opener,
and increased awareness of the risks posed by electoral interference. They also highlighted the leading role played by content farms (→ p. 367) since it is now accepted that,
during the 2018 campaign, a large part of the published content was produced in content farms coordinated by the PLA.245

2. The presidential and legislative elections of January 2020
On January 11, 2020 Taiwan organized its 15th presidential election and 10th legislative
election. Democratic Progressive Party Incumbent Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected with 57.1%
of the votes, against the Kuomintang candidate Han Kuo-Yu (38.61%) and the People
First Party candidate James Soong (4.26%). Turnout stood at 75% (compared to 66% in
2016) – the highest in twenty years. According to Liberty Times Net, the number of voters
that registered abroad doubled compared to 2016.246 The DPP also maintained its majority
in the Legislative Yuan, while losing a few seats (from 68 to 61). The KMT gained three
seats (now 38). The Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), led by the mayor of Taipei, won 5 seats
but only 1.5 million votes, compared to 4.8 million and 4.7 million for the DPP and KMT
respectively. The remaining 9 seats went to other parties. This election also contributed
to feminizing the parliament: women won 45.6% of the seats, which is comparable to
Scandinavian countries.
During this election, and not unlike the preceding one, “we observed Chinese
state-affiliated activities stealthily targeting every segment of the influence operations lifecycle, from production and amplification to dissemination.”247 Beijing
started by covertly funding some candidates. In December 2019, the Justice Ministry

revealed it had identified 66 cases since July, involving 279 people, six of whom had been
arrested, in connection to amounts paid from accounts located in China as well as in Hong
Kong, Indonesia, and Vietnam, reaching 100 billion Taiwanese dollars (€2.95 billion).248
Authorities also found and closed 1,700 clandestine casinos, seized more than 50 million
Taiwanese dollars (€1.48 million).249
Information manipulation was however less prominent than expected, for several
reasons. First, precisely because the government and civil society were better prepared following the 2018 fiasco.250 Second, because Chinese efforts had been concentrated on the Hong Kong crisis, particularly between September and November 2019,
leading to more sloppy and less subtle operations against Taiwan that were easier to spot
for these reasons. These operations were also carried out in vain, since the Hong Kong
crisis was a strong repellant: it confirmed Beijing’s anti-democratic ambitions and the
failure of a “One Country, Two Systems” policy. This clearly made things more difficult
for pro-unification candidates, particularly for Han Kuo-yu (KMT), the incumbent president’s main opponent. It became quite clear during the summer, or at the beginning of
the fall of 2019, that he would not win the presidency. From that moment on, there was
no point for Beijing in investing too much in an unwinnable election. What could be
impacted, though, were the legislative elections, which was taking place simultaneously, with
the objective of making as many pro-unification candidates win as possible. Finally, digital
platforms were proactive. Facebook, especially, recruited a staff to specifically oversee
the electoral campaign, set up an “election war room,” deleted 51 accounts, 118 pages as
well as 99 groups linked to them for “unauthentic behavior.” Suppressions of this kind are
actually frequent but they were noticed this time around, because one of the groups, supporting Han Kuo-yu’s candidacy, had more than 150,000 followers. Facebook had to justify
itself. Apparently, the manipulations were not coordinated, and their origin was not established. From Facebook’s point of view, elements hinting to China (such as the use of
simplified characters or the time when people were active) were not necessarily problematic, Chinese web-users having the right to express support for a Taiwanese candidate.
We should also note that the page belonging to the third candidate, James Soong (founder
and president of the pro-unification and anti-independence People’s First Party) gained
500,000 “likes” (+359%) and almost 500,000 followers (+356%) between the December
12 and 16, 2019, compared to only about 12,000 (both likes and followers) in the following
weeks – a gain “unlikely to be organic,”251 that points at the use of bots and fake accounts
to artificially inflate a community.
According to the Taiwan FactCheck Center, the first fact-checking organization in
Taiwan, the disinformation campaign accelerated in October: before, most of their
activities revolved around debunking false news about science, health, food safety, environment, trafficking, and so on. But in October, political topics became prevalent. And
most of the false news were published in simplified Chinese, thus presumably produced in mainland China.252 A significant proportion focused on procedural elements,
the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) mostly, with rumors about the ink that was being

used (said to invalidate votes for Han Kuo-yu), ballot delivery, counting, etc. These tactics
hoped to cast doubt on the election’s integrity, thus lowering trust in the results.
This is a tactic used by people who know they will lose: if an election cannot be
won, at least try to weaken the winner. Other more topic-based operations targeted
international tourism (accusing the government of paying tourists), gay marriage, or the
idea that President Tsai “was profiting off AIDS” because she invested in biotechnologies.
In order to spread the idea that even the administration had lost trust in the government, opponents published a fake news targeting the
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chen
Chu (陳菊), a leading DPP figure, saying that an
investigation from the Ministry of Justice established that she was corrupt and had stolen 50 billion Taiwanese dollars (€1.48 billion) when she
was Mayor of Kaohsiung. This rumor was initiated in April 2019 by the Chinese Phoenix press
agency. The Ministry of Justice Investigative
Bureau did deny it in a November press release,
but it was not enough, and the fake news was
intensely shared during the campaign’s final
month, in December 2019. And it completely stopped the day after the election, which
confirmed that its goal was indeed to influence the results.253
Media-based disinformation was present during the campaign. On Facebook,
DFRLab gave the example of a CCP-aligned page that spread disinformation on the
president: “Headlines across the Strait” (@taiwanheadlines 兩岸頭), was still active in
March 2021, with more than 766,000 followers. Created in 2015, DFRLab noted that it
underwent a series of name changes – one indicator of inauthentic behavior. In October
2018 (ahead of the 2016 president election), its first name was “2016 Taiwan Presidential
Election” (台湾大选). Following Tsai Ing-wen’s victory in January 2016, the page became
“Advice to Tsai Ing-wen” (向蔡英文建言) and was later renamed several times, adapting it to the local political context. The owner of this page is the Chinese company VTV
Internet Technology Jiangsu Limited Co. (微视网络科技江苏有限公). The main shareholder of the company is the Elion group, whose chairman of the board, Wang Wenbiao,
is a businessman “who also holds [an] important position in the CCP’s Chinese People’s
Political Consultative Conference, the ‘highest-ranking entity overseeing the United Front
system’.”254

Aside from Facebook, Twitter, LINE, and YouTube, other platforms such as PTT,
Dcard, and Weibo, were also used to spread disinformation during the 2020 presidential election campaign.255 YouTube can be used to recycle debunked printed fake
news into videos, and it was used much more than before.256 Several videos, for example,
questioned the authenticity of Tsai Ing-wen’s PhD (see screenshot below) – a persisting rumor, already prevalent on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, so much so that the
prestigious London School of Economics (LSE) had to publish a press release in October
2019 to attest that Tsai ing-wen did indeed receive a PhD in law in 1984.257 This campaign
lasted until after the election, as the idea that her PhD was fake gave legitimacy to
the notion that the election was fake as well. Thus, on February 21, 2020, a petition
appeared on the White House website258 “We the People,” titled: “Luc 8:17: we want the
truth on the Taiwanese president’s fraudulent PhD.”259 This petition was shared profusely
on social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) in Taiwan as well as in the Chinesespeaking press in the United States,260 as part of articles or advertisements that called on
the Chinese diaspora to sign the petition.261 But, with only 42,347 people signatures in 30
days, the petition did not reach the 100,000-signature threshold required to be considered
by the U.S. government. However, as soon as the petition closed, another petition was
created by the same Internet user (L.H.) which claimed that the reason why the petition
did not meet the required threshold is that it was “hacked” by “Tsai’s hackers,” including
her minister of digital affairs Audrey Tang. This second petition asked the White House to
conduct an investigation – without much success either, it only collected 3,647 signatures
in 30 days.262

C. Agriculture as a key battleground for disinformation
Farmers are a significant voter base in Taiwan and, with the Taiwanese working-class,
one of the two groups most supportive of the current government. They are thus regularly targeted with disinformation in the hope of turning them against the DPP – operations in which content farms (→ p. 367) usually play an important role.264
Banana prices fell in May 2018 due to a rising production, quickly reaching a five-year low
before the Agricultural Council intervened. But many articles written by content farms sustained and exaggerated the farmer’s “panic.” One article on Mission titled “Pineapple prices
are bad, bananas also go below the dollar, and seasonal fruits are not good either: farmers
are now panicking,” was largely shared on May 29, 2018 on the Facebook pages “Kaobei
DPP, Recall the DPP” (罷免民進黨) and “Kaobei Current Events” (靠北時事). Two days
later, the website China Review, which belongs to the China Review News Agency, created in
Hong Kong in 2005 (a part of the China Review Group (中国 评论集团) created in 1998),
published an article on its website in Taiwan quoting a farmer who presumably said that “if
the Tsai government does not act quickly, we will see if farmers do not rebel.” This article
was picked up by the content farm Nooho which merged it with another article and added
a new title: “if the DPP does not fall, farmers will be good-for-nothings.”
The following day, on June 2, an unknown writer on Mission copied and modified an
article initially published in the Apple Daily Taiwan (蘋果日報), changing its title to “Helen
Chang [a DPP politician]: it’s China’s fault if we have an oversupply of fruits, it’s a matter of national security” and spread it on forums and on Facebook. At the same time,
Xinhua and the Chinese content farm Meiri Toutiao (每日頭條) wrote that “the Taiwanese
public opinion believes that the DPP authorities’ refusal to recognize the 1992 consensus
effectively froze inter-strait relations and severely impacted tourism industries, agricultural
industries and fishing in Taiwan. The continental market is essential in solving unmarketable price declines in Taiwan.”

Picture with misleading captions also circulated on social media. On one of them, presumably taken in June 2018, a truck is seen dumping bananas in a ditch in Kaohsiung.
On LINE, this photo came with comments such as “the media does not dare report that
the bananas from Qishan and Meinong in Kaohsiung are massively thrown away, everything has been silenced” (高雄旗山美濃的香蕉棄置現場新聞不敢報，一切都新聞封
鎖), or that a kilo of bananas was now sold for one dollar (台香蕉一公斤一元). But the
Taiwanese journalist Li Huiyi (李慧宜) took the picture in 2007 for the 我们的岛 TV
show on public television. And to prove that the “recent” photo was a fake, she went back
to the exact same spot on June 6, 2018.265
Similarly, a picture showing thousands of pineapples rotting in a pond spread on social
media in 2018, particularly on LINE, with the same narrative (DPP policies are responsible
for declining prices, pushing farmers to throw their production away). In fact, this photo
had been taken in Xuwen District, in the Zhanjiang city jurisdiction of Guangdong, in
mainland China.266
A year later, the same scenario was repeated: articles initially published on Mission and then
shared on Facebook fan pages divided the
Taiwanese society (this time about a story on
pesticides and bananas) and Chinese content
farms like Meiri Toutiao kept painting China in a
positive light, claiming it bought Taiwanese goods
to help the island’s farmers, who were incidentally
grateful for that.
For example, on March 8, 2019, in the middle of
an election campaign – in a move visibly aimed at
weakening the DPP – the pro-KMT CTi television channel aired an interview in which a grapefruit producer said that farmers had poured 200
million tons of grapefruits in the Zengwen reservoir (曾文水库) the previous year.267 The
interview was immediately picked up by KMT member Hsieh Lung-chieh (謝龍介) who,
standing behind the presenter, corrected the number because it was too high: he admitted
it was probably closer to 120 million tons – which remains huge and unconvincing. Later in
265. 李慧宜 (Li Hui-yi), “記者還原真相! 旗山美濃香蕉「沒有棄置現場」請別流傳傷害農民” (“A
Journalist Re-Establishes the Truth! No Abandonned Banana in Qishan, Please, Do Not Spread Rumors that Could

about the Zengwen River (曾文溪). Nevertheless, CTi captioned its video: “200 million
tons of grapefruit are thrown in the reservoir” (see screenshot below).

D. A Chinese journalist posed as a Taiwanese YouTuber (2019)
In August 2019, an Internet user showed what he considered to be evidence that
President Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP were “selling” Taiwan to Japan and the United States
in a video shared on YouTube and Facebook.268 He spoke Mandarin with a Taiwanese
accent and used traditional characters in his video’s subtitles. He even perfectly
mastered the Taiwanese dialect, so much so that he really seemed to be a native of
Taiwan. However, the Investigative Bureau of the Ministry of Justice revealed that he was
a Chinese agent spreading fake news.269 A body of corroborating evidence did indeed
show that he was a journalist and radio presenter serving the PRC.
In his video, the Internet user contended that DPP members were the descendants of
Japanese colonizers who took money away from Taiwanese taxpayers to enrich Japan. He
said that, according to official numbers from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, more than
a third of the trade surplus from business with the PRC was given to Japan. It was meant
as an irrefutable proof that DPP members, including Tsai and the Taiwanese representative in Japan Frank Hsieh (謝長廷), were “sold” to Japan: they were described as inciting
Taiwanese people to accept imported “radioactive” food from the Fukushima region, that
Japan struggled to sell abroad. The video’s author also criticized Tsai’s government for
squandering Taiwanese taxpayer’s money by buying military equipment that “is not even
working” – a hint at the F-16V bought from the United States. He ended the video by calling his viewers to make the right choice during the 2020 presidential election.
This was the first video posted on his YouTube channel and Facebook page “At the
Foot of Mount Jade” (玉山腳下), a name referring to the Yu Shan mountain at the center
of Taiwan. In two months, the video was liked over a thousand times on each platform,
shared more than 1,700 times on Facebook, watched more than 15,800 times on YouTube

and 127,000 times on Facebook. The YouTube channel has since been made private, but
the videos remain accessible on his Facebook page. In other videos, he fueled controversy
over Tsai’s PhD,270 accused the United States of interference in Taiwanese elections through
their support for Tsai,271 or called on Taiwanese media to be more disciplined, verifying
facts rather than spreading rumors.272
This person, who introduced himself as Xida (希達), seemed to be Zhang Xida (
张 希达), a PRC journalist and radio presenter. His employee profile is easy to find
on HelloTaiwan (nihaotw.com),273 a media platform for Taiwanese audiences owned by
the China National Radio (中央人民广播电台).274 The latter belongs to the China Media
Group (中央广播电视总台), or Voice of China (中国之声), a subordinate to the State
Council of the PRC.

Zhang Xida is a journalist, author of many articles on issues related to relations
between China and Taiwan.275 He also followed Han Kuo-yu for a few months and portrayed him in a very favorable light in a video published on Weibo on March 27, 2019
by the Cross-straits Internet Exchange Committee of the Internet Society of China (中
国互联网协会海峡两岸互联网交流委员会).276 It effectively introduced Zhan Xida
as a CNR journalist (“央广记者”).277 The post was then picked up by the account of
a show on the Shenzhou Easy Radio station, otherwise known as CNR 6 (中央 人民

conception of one of its daily shows, broadcast since 2012 from the first Chinese boat
that connected the city of Quanzhou to the Kinmen (Quemoy) Island, the Pengjiang (蓬
江輪).280
Other details revealed his Chinese identity: he used the term “dangju” (当局) to talk
about Taiwanese authorities, which is not used by Taiwanese people because it implies that
the authorities in power are not legitimate.281 It is used by the Chinese however. In addition to that, in another video, the wrong transcription in simplified characters of the word
“gan” in the expression “dried mangos” (芒果 干) was noticed. The traditional character
is usually written “乾” (pronounced in the first tone) but the author used “幹,” which is
homophonous (pronounced in the fourth tone). However, both characters were simplified
in the PRC as “干.” Hence the mistake made by Zhang Xida, who involuntarily revealed
that he was from the continent, and not from Taiwan.282

taken the time to construct a robust backstory and to delete any trace of his activity in
China.

E. The Li Jie Case (2019)
On June 18, 2019, an Internet user called Li Jie (李杰, also transcribed as “Li Chieh”)
circulated a text on several Facebook groups stating that the Tsai administration had given
1 billion Taiwanese dollars (€29.5 million) to support the “violent” protests in Hong Kong,
but that it had refused to give anything for the prevention and the fight against dengue fever
in Kaohsiung (see screenshots below).
His posts gathered between 600 and 800 “likes” on the groups, and they were shared
between 300 and 800 times, all within less than 24 hours. The Taiwanese authorities
refuted the claim as early as the next day, opened an investigation, and revealed that
the IP address belonged to an Internet user who had already been reported for a similar initiative the year before.284 Li Jie’s profile was thus suspended, and his posts were
deleted. From screenshots captured before he was suspended, we learned that Li Jie
had signed up to Facebook in July 2018 and presented himself as an inhabitant of
Kaohsiung.

On the left: “The violent protests in Hong Kong received an aid of one billion [Taiwanese dollars] from Tsai’s government [but]
Kaohsiung did not receive anything to prevent and fight the dengue fever.”
On the right: “Open your eyes wide, one billion!!! It was one billion!!! We have enough money for others to spend it,
but not one cent to save our own population! Tsai’s government sent one billion [Taiwanese dollars]
to support the protests against the amendment to the Extradition Law
by the Hong Kong government, and receives severe warnings from mainland China.”
Source: Liberty Times Net.

The cases of dengue fever in Kaohsiung had already sparked controversy between KMT
supporters who, out of sheer political calculation, criticized the DPP for not allocating
enough money to dengue prevention in Kaohsiung; on their part, DPP supporters criticized how Han Kuo-yu dealt with the crisis.285
At least three of the Facebook groups on which Li Jie spread the fake news were
identified as overtly anti-DPP or pro-KMT. A first group was created in February and

had more than 23,500 members.286 It was fully aligned with the positions adopted by CTi

“[the] analysis of Ms. Joyce Huang is rational and pertinent,
always grounded in evidence and it deserves to be praised.
Together with our new website of Confucian commentaries [Rujiawang], she can support us
and unmask the absurdities and lies of the so-called Taiwanese who are actually Japanese.”

With more than 32,000 members,287 another group was created in March 2018 to support Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜), the KMT mayor of New Taipei, in his campaign for the 2018
provincial elections. Thanks to its page’s current cover picture, we can see that the group
also supported Han Kuo-yu’s 2020 presidential bid.

Screenshot of the Facebook page that endorsed Hou Yu-ih.

The third group,288 with a community of 54,000 members, was created in April 2014
to support the KMT politician Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱). The group changed its name
in August 2019, signaling its direct support for Han Kuo-yu, seen below with Hung. The
group’s earlier description called for everyone to come together against “pro-independence
people and fascists.”

Hence, it is hardly surprising that Li Jie’s posts were well-received in these groups, in
which several members expressed their opposition to the protests in Hong Kong.
We know little on “Li Jie,” whose Facebook profile is no longer available, except that
his name was written in simplified, non-traditional characters. This detail fed speculations
that Li Jie, a common name in Chinese, was a PRC agent masquerading as Taiwanese and
claiming to be from Kaohsiung, or at least as living there.
Moreover, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) revealed
that Li Jie’s IP address was the same as Li Ronggui’s (李榮
貴, also transcribed as “Li Jung-kuei”), and located in
Singapore.289 According to the CIB, it likely to be the same
person. Li Ronggui’s profile spread a number of false news targeting Chen Chi-mai (陳其邁), a DPP candidate at the provincial elections for the city of Kaohsiung in 2018; for example, it
claimed that he and his father owned foreign assets worth 2.2
billion Taiwanese dollars (€65 million).290 Han Kuo-yu won the
election, but it is impossible to assess whether these manipulations played a role in the KMT candidate’s victory.

F. The Covid-19 pandemic (2020)
This lost opportunity, for China, was quickly followed by a new opportunity for disinformation: the Covid-19 pandemic. It was all the more important that, in Taiwan,
information manipulation had focused on health issues more than on politics in
recent years, as Audrey Tang explained: “most viral rumors are not political, they are

472

about food safety, they are about health […] That is dominant.”291 In other words, the
Taiwanese society was particularly vulnerable to the Covid-19 “Infodemic.”
In late February and early March 2020, “Chinese users organized a coordinated disinformation campaign to smear the Taiwanese government on Facebook,
Twitter, and YouTube. Rumors spread included that the government was covering up
domestic cases of the coronavirus, the DPP was profiting off of the disease, and bodies
were being burned en masse or buried secretly in construction sites. Chinese Weibo users
openly bragged about spreading these rumors on Facebook.”292 On Twitter, the hashtag
#台湾肺炎 (Taiwan pneumonia) was used to make people believe that the virus was
Taiwanese. Chinese media also defended the idea that Taiwanese authorities used the
health crisis to pursue political independence (以疫谋独) but that this “shameful ploy”
would end in bitter failure.293 The announcement of a Taiwan-United States partnership
to combine their efforts in the fight the pandemic (台美防疫伙伴关系) and Taiwan’s
subsequent donation of 10,000 masks a week to the United States triggered a surge of criticisms from China. In an op-ed widely shared across Chinese networks, Xinhua described
the decision as a political maneuver by Taiwan to get closer to the U.S. at the expense of
its population’s well-being, an act depicted as treason. How could the DPP give so many
masks to the United States when the Taiwanese population had trouble finding any? Xinhua
condemned Taiwan’s policy of being “distrustful toward China but not the United States or
Europe” (只防大陆，不防欧美). This policy, which they described as “hating China and
flattering the United States,” was “even more harmful than the virus” (仇中媚美 比病毒
更毒) according to the media.294
This campaign also contained interesting cases of
image and identity theft. On several occasions the
accounts spreading these rumors portrayed themselves as
established media: for example, @APChinese_ (an
account since suspended by Twitter) used the logo of the
Associated Press as a profile picture. In a tweet posted
February 28 (see image), this account, which posed as a
Chinese branch of the Associated Press, accused the government of hiding Covid-19 deaths and illustrated its
point with a hijacked picture of corpses (captured in 2006
and showing the victims of an Indonesian earthquake).
In the second half of March 2020, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice
organized a press conference to announce that 196 (72%) of the 271 cases of disinformation on the pandemic for which an investigation had been opened had originated
in China: “Chinese users prepare messages aimed at the Taiwanese public, they
co-ordinate the manner in which these messages are spread, then they use fake
accounts to spread the messages on Taiwanese Facebook groups.”295

Among those cases were false testimonies which all followed a formulaic blueprint:
“My father is a city councilor and another council member told him that Taiwan actually
has more than 500 cases of Covid-19 and 200 related deaths” (elements of the formula
like “my father” or “councilor” sometimes changed to give the impression of a variety of
sources). One could also find doctored screenshots of Taiwanese TV channels and fake
Taiwanese governmental press releases.296
One of the most persistent rumors in subsequent weeks was that of a (fake) racist
Taiwanese campaign against the director general of the WHO. On April 8, Tedros
Ghebreyeus, who is known to be close to the CCP (→ p. 213), declared during a press conference that he was the target of a racist campaign on social media that had been going on
for months and he accused Taiwan of being its instigator.297 President Tsai and the Taiwanese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately denied having anything to do with the campaign.
Two days later, in the midst of numerous messages of apology posted by Taiwanese users on
social media, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice declared that these accounts
were in fact Chinese, and not Taiwanese. The investigators noted the existence of numerous
identical messages to prove that this was a coordinated operation, as shown by the screenshots
below. These messages frequently appeared on a false account modelled on that of Radio
Free Asia in order to spread confusion.298 The ASPI showed that 60% of the 65 accounts
diffusing these messages of apology in traditional Chinese had previously tweeted in
simplified Chinese, which seemed to indicate that their owners were Chinese from
the mainland hoping to pose as Taiwanese.299 The whole campaign was apparently a
Chinese operation meant to weaken Taiwan’s position. This seemed to be confirmed
by the rapidity with which officials from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed
support for the director general of the WHO, and by the mobilization of the patriotic rap
group CD REV which published a video clip about the scandal on April 14. The song entitled
“Mr. Virus is warning us!” took up the idea of a racist Taiwanese campaign against the head
of the WHO.300

Examples of identical messages (thus indicating a coordinated campaign). Translation: “I am Taiwanese
and I am terribly ashamed of the Taiwanese who attacked Tedros in such a vicious way.
On behalf of the Taiwanese people, I apologize to Tedros and ask him to forgive me.”

The campaign had probabaly a twofold objective. A long-term objective first:
Beijing could not prevent the re-election of Tsai but it could try to discredit her
and the DPP while undermining the confidence of the population in its government’s actions. And a short-term objective: to make people forget Taiwan’s excellent handling of the pandemic, which could be interpreted by some observers as a
demonstration of the virtues of the model of liberal democracy, especially in terms of
the circulation of information. Indeed, Taiwan was seldom affected by the pandemic
(there were very few cases, no necessary nation-wide lockdown and citizens kept living
normal lives even in crowded entertainment venues) and, even worse for the CCP, in
2020, Taiwan’s GDP growth (+2.98%) was greater than China’s (+2.3%) for the first
time since 1991. Furthermore, Taiwan had never been more internationally visible and
president Tsai’s popularity broke records – these factors merely exacerbated Beijing’s
resentment.
The deteriorating health situation on the island in the spring of 2021 therefore provided the CCP with an opportunity. Numbers remained very low compared to other countries, but there was an epidemic outbreak in May 2021. This was accompanied by an
“Infodemic” outbreak, a spike in informational attacks presumably created and/or
amplified by mainland Chinese actors.301

G. Diplomatic Relations
Diplomatic relations, along with military affairs, are more often used in the psychological warfare (see the case of military exercises → p. 478), but they can also be at the center
of the dissemination of false information. Here are four examples. First, in 2018, as
Taiwan had just lost its diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso, a user of the Taiwanese social
media platform PTT spread the rumor that the Foreign Affairs Minister of Honduras was
currently in Beijing negotiating the conditions for breaking its diplomatic relations with
Taiwan in the next 48 hours and that Haiti would follow suit. This created a wave of panic
in Taiwanese diplomatic circles until the Honduran minister denied the rumor.302 Beijing’s
objective is to maintain a permanent insecurity and tension over Taiwan’s diplomatic relations by wooing away its few diplomatic allies one by one and by manipulating information to heighten its anxieties.
Second, in the course of the summer 2018 a rumor spread on social media, mostly on
LINE, according to which Air Canada would no longer recognize Taiwanese passports
after July 25 – the rumor picked up in intensity and forced the Minister of Foreign Affairs
to publish a press release to deny it.303 It is true, however, that more and more airline companies and airports are giving in to Beijing’s pressure to categorize Taiwanese booking as
Chinese and Taiwanese cities as destinations inside China. Nevertheless, a Taiwanese passport remains valid and gives visa-free access to far more countries (145) than a Chinese
passport (75).304 In fact, Taiwan announced in early September 2020 the removal of the
appelation “Republic of China” (the official name of Taiwan, which can lead to confusion)
from its new passports, to avoid any ambiguity and to resist Chinese pressure. This concession should be put into perspective, as the Chinese wording (中華民國) remains present
and the one in English appears inside the passports.
Third, the Taiwanese Minister of Foreign Affairs was forced to intervene to put an end
to an insistent rumor spread by the Chinese website xilu.com that Taiwan was planning
to lease the Taiping Island (Itu Aba) to the United States. This is the largest of the
Spratly Islands, a disputed archipelago in the South China Sea.305 In the context of a SinoAmerican “Cold War,” misinformation tied to the United States will certainly become
more prevalent, to increase inter-strait tensions and ultimately provide a pretext for
Beijing to intervene.
Fourth, to kill two birds with one stone, turning the Taiwanese population against its
own government and an allied state, Beijing also spreads fake news aimed not only at the
United States but also at Japan. For example, in April 2021, a fake memo from the Office
of the President stating that the Taiwanese government had agreed to receive contaminated
(nuclear) water from Fukushima circulated on Facebook. The real origin of the memo was
easy to discover as it contained simplified Chinese characters. The president’s spokesperson
immediately denounced the maneuver, calling it “cognitive warfare” and President Tsai also
published a denial on Facebok:

The ICAO’s Twitter account
Late January 2020 several Twitter users found that their accounts had been blocked by
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) after posting tweets on the agency’s policy toward Taiwan.
The ICAO was then headed by Liu Fang, one of the Chinese nationals in charge of one of the
15 UN specialized agencies (→ p. 206). Since her arrival at the head of this agency, the ICAO
has stopped inviting Taiwan to participate in its tri-annual assembly.306 This exclusion has
led to criticisms at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Several people expressed regrets
on Twitter that Taiwan was not included in the exchanges with ICAO members, even
though Taoyuan airport is a major hub for airport connections in the region, with more than
72 million passengers transiting every year toward more than 150 cities across the world.307
The polemic grew with the reactions of Jessica Drun, a non-resident member of Project 2049,
who posted the following tweet on January 22: “Want to drive the point home that two orgs,
@WHO & @icao, refuse to share knowledge w/ Taiwan authorities. This means civil aviation
authorities for one of busiest regional airports do not receive up-to-date info on any potential
ICAO-WHO efforts.”308
A few days later, on January 25, she brought attention to the fact that she had been blocked
by the ICAO’s Twitter account even though she was not calling for recognition of
Taiwan as a member of the ICAO, but only for Taiwan’s inclusion in the talks.309
Numerous other users – think-tank analysts, academics, journalists and other observers – also
noticed that they had been blocked by the agency after criticizing Taiwan’s exclusion.310
Beyond the symbolism of this gesture, the effect was that these users could no longer consult
the publications of the agency’s account.
The ICAO went even further by blocking users who simply referred to the affair, such
as Alex Dukalskis, associate professor at University College Dublin and China Fellow at the
Wilson Center. Dukalskis revealed that, after writing to the ICAO, following its advice, he
was asked to criticize himself to have a chance of having his Twitter account unblocked: “If
you could therefore firstly reassure me that you recognize you were mistaken in your earlier
questions and posts, and secondly confirm that you were not aware that your activities were
augmenting risks to the safety and security of our staff, we’d be willing to reconsider re-establishing your ability to post your personal opinions on our account.”311
The ICAO’s immunity – originally conceived to protect international organizations from
state interference – does not allow these decisions to be challenged in court. But this behavior

contradicts the fundamental mission of these agencies, which are supposed to facilitate information sharing, and it brings into question the impartiality of ICAO authorities. In this instance, the ICAO’s Twitter account was managed by a Chinese national named Guang
Qining, who seemed to have suspended her LinkedIn profile as the affair was publicized.312
Before being recruited by the ICAO, Guan worked for the Civil Aviation Administration of
China, as did Secretary General Liu Fang, and for the Pan-Chinese Journalist Association
which, as J. Michael Cole explained, is an organization that oversees, among other tasks, the
broadcasting of Party propaganda on foreign media.313 Guang Qining was not, however, in
charge of the agency’s PR but this modus operandi seemed to have been fully approved by
the head of communication, Anthony Philbin, according to whom the ICAO is obliged to
block people who intentionally and publicly damage the agency’s image, forcing the ICAO
to protect the integrity of its broadcast information and the discussions arising from it.314
The ICAO has in fact characterized Taiwan as a Chinese province.315 Besides, this
agency also behaved similarly in March 2019 by blocking voices critical of its environmental
policy.316

IV. Armed Force
Beijing has always used military exercises – for the impact they have in their
own right and for the ease with which they can be exaggerated in the media – as
a means of psychological warfare against Taiwan – particularly (but not solely)
during elections, as a way to influence, or at least to send a message to the winners. For instance, between July 1995 and June 1996, with the presidential election scheduled for March 23, 1996, China organized no fewer than six military exercises aimed at
the island, firing missiles into the sea a few dozen kilometers away from the Taiwanese
coast. Not long before, in 1994, while a novel anticipating a Chinese invasion of Taiwan
one year later became one of the island’s best-sellers,317 Beijing was conducting its biggest
military exercises in years.
Military pressure has intensified since Tsai Ing-wen’s election in 2016, an admission that the Chinese soft power failed to win the hearts and minds of Taiwan’s
population. The PLA regularly simulates an invasion of the island. For example,
in August 2020, in response to what Beijing saw as an American provocation (the U.S.
Secretary of Health and Human Services visited Taiwan), the PLA conducted amphibious
landing exercises. The PLA actually has a full-scale replica of a part of downtown Taipei on
the military base of Zhurihe, which includes the Taiwanese presidential palace and has been
used to simulate assaults.318 Intrusions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone
(ADIZ) have multiplied in recent years. And 2020 was saw a record 380 incursions by

Chinese aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.319 Beijing stepped up its activities immediately after
President Tsai’s re-election, as if to send a signal. The first quarter of 2021 confirmed
that the pressure is still mounting, with two large Chinese air sorties on March 26 and
April 12, the latter involving 25 aircrafts simultaneously.320 These violations usually grow
more intense during particular events over which Beijing wishes to exert its influence, such
as the Taiwanese national holiday (October 10), diplomatic visits (as in September 2020,
with the visit of the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the
Environment), or during the inauguration of the new U.S. president. Between January 23
and 25, for instance, a few days int Joe Biden’s presidency, Beijing tested the president’s
resolve by sending 13 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ the first day, 15 on the second, and 15
on the third, a record number since September 2020.321 On September 23, 2021, and while
it expressed disapproval of Taiwan’s accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the
Party-State sent 24 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. These massive sorties are becoming more
and more frequent, and intimidating, with a clear acceleration since October 1, 2021 (the
PRC’s National Day): 145 Chinese planes entered Taiwan’s ADIZ in 4 days (38 on
October 1, which was already an absolute record, then 39 on the 2nd, 16 on the 3rd and 52
on the 4th).322
As J. Michael Cole explained, this “latest militarization of Beijing’s posture comprises
two main vectors – increased PLA activity and preparedness in the vicinity of Taiwan, combined with a sustained campaign of psychological warfare against the Taiwanese government and public.”323 Indeed, these exercises are generally accompanied by a bellicose
rhetoric from Chinese media, which exaggerate their scale and significance. In April
2018, relatively minor scheduled exercises were taking place off the coast of Quanzhou
in the province of Fujian, but the Chinese press turned them into “live fire drills to check
‘Taiwan Independence,’” as the Global Times headlined.324 J. Michael Cole also noted that
these exercises “were ostensibly timed to coincide with a visit to Swaziland by President
Tsai Ing-wen.”325 In August 2020, the Global Times described military exercises “not
[as a] warning but [as a] rehearsal for [a] Taiwan takeover” by the PLA, which was
deemed inevitable.326 Confirming the crushing superiority of the PLA and its capacity
to attack the island from all sides, the unabashed objective of these exercises is to “deter
Taiwan secessionists.”327 Hence, military exercises targeting Taiwan are increasingly
frequent and the propaganda that accompanies them is growing more aggressive.
The purpose of these daily intrusions and this constant pressure is not only meant to
create a permanent threat in the Taiwanese minds, or even a sense of inevitability for
a Chinese invasion, but to create the conditions for an incident which would likely end
badly. Pierre Haski explained that “[the] risk is not, at least not yet, a deliberate trigger of

war, but rather an incident that can trigger a series of events which would be difficult to
stop.”328 The Taiwanese are aware of this and remain calm: they know they are targeted by
operations of psychological warfare and that the mistake, the excuse Beijing is waiting
for, would be to offer an overreaction paving the way for an escalation.329
One case is particularly instructive. On December 16, 2016, the PLA Air Force (PLAAF)’s
Weibo account published a picture of an airborne (nuclear-capable) H-6 bomber, registered under the number 20019 (which indicated it belonged to the 10th Bomber Division
based in Anqing330). On the picture one could see two mountains in the distance peaking
above a sea of clouds (Figure 1).331
Chinese Internet users quickly put forward a first hypothesis: the two peaks in the background could be part of the Jade Mountain, also called Yushan (玉山), which culminates at
3,952 meters and is located on the island of Taiwan, in Nantou County. Hence, by analyzing
the orientation of the two peaks, some Internet users believed that the bomber was coming
from the north and heading south and that therefore the picture was taken by the PLAAF
during a drill around Taiwan on November 25.332 Others suggested that it was more likely
the long-distance surveillance exercise of December 10.333

When users linked this photo to others published by the same PLAAF Weibo account
two days earlier, which showed the plane in the same position but from a different angle,
it revealed not two but three peaks in the background (Figure 2). And a second hypothesis was then laid out – about another Taiwanese mountain, Mount Beidawushan (北大武
山), which culminates at 3,902 meters, and is located on the southern tip of the island in
Pintung County.334
On December 17, 2016, the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense denied that the picture
showed Mount Yushan.335 In fact, as Mount Yushan is 50 km away from the sea and around
200 km inside the ADIZ, the proportions of the aircraft in relation to the mountain suggested that if it were Mount Yushan, the picture had to have been taken from inside the
Taiwanese ADIZ.336 One Internet user suggested that the picture was taken at a distance
of 100-150 km from the Mount (Figure 3).337 But two complementary counter-arguments
were advanced by Taiwan: if this was indeed the silhouette of Mount Yushan then the
proportions in the picture had to have been doctored, or it could simply have been a different mountain, such as Beidawushan, which is closer to the sea.338 The reluctance of the
Taiwanese authorities to recognize that the PLAAF’s picture was taken from the eastern
coast of Taiwan was understandable since it reinforced the idea that the PLA was capable
of attacking the island from all sides.339

In April 2018, the PLAAF’s Weibo account posted a 4-minute promotional video in
which a scene had clearly been taken from the preceding photos (Figure 4). This was not an
isolated case: the Chinese Air Force frequently posts photos and videos of its fighters
around Taiwan, to keep the pressure up. This is a typical illustration of psychological
warfare. Whether the picture had been taken from Mount Yushan or not, the harm was
done as doubt was sowed in the Taiwanese public opinion. The goal was to undermine the Taiwanese people’s trust in their armed forces’ ability to track PLA movements, to react quickly, defend the territorial sovereignty of the island and protect
the people from a PRC attack. “The photos send a message […] to Taiwan’s citizens,
to highlight the inability of their government to stop such flights. […]. When two H-6Ks
entered Taiwan’s ADIZ during the July 20th flight, the Chinese pilots said they and the
Taiwanese were the “same people,” an illustration of Chinese claims to Taiwan.”340

Another way for Beijing to exert military pressure on Taiwan is to spread false
or biased news that would constitute a casus belli if they were proven accurate. For
instance, a rumor suggested that American military planes were using Taiwanese bases: in
August 2020 Internet users claimed that a U.S. Navy Lockheed EP-3 electronic warfare and
reconnaissance aircraft had landed in Taiwan and taken off several times.342 The news was
spread on social media, most notably by the South China Sea Probing Initiative (SCSPI).343 It
was then taken up by the Global Times, which quoted the SCSPI and, as usual, issued threats
as to the consequences for Taiwan if this was proven true: it would amount to “crossing a
red line” and Beijing could “destroy the relevant airport on the island and the US military
aircraft that land there – a war in the Taiwan Straits [would] thus begin.” The newspaper
demanded to the Taiwanese and U.S. authorities to avoid “[playing] with fire,” and it went
further, recommending that “Beijing officially declare the ‘airspace’ over the Taiwan Island

as a patrol area of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The PLA’s reconnaissance aircraft
and fighter jets will perform missions over Taiwan Island [to] check whether there are US
military planes landing at Taiwan’s airports or US warships docking at the island’s ports. If
the island’s military dares to fire the first shot at the PLA’s aircraft, it will mean provocation
of a war, and the PLA should immediately destroy Taiwan’s military forces and achieve
reunification through military means.”344
The initial information on the presence of U.S. military planes on the island had no
factual basis and it was denied by the Taiwanese authorities. As Cole noted, the SCSPI on
which the Global Times based its threats is not a neutral actor, despite the fact that
it presents itself as such: the group has ties to the University of Beijing. The director of the SCSPI, Hu Bo (胡波), is also the director for the Center of Maritime Strategic
Studies at the University of Beijing. One of the members of the SCSPI’s board of director
is the president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies (NISCSS, 中国南海
研究院). The SCSPI and the NISCSS are regularly used as “platforms to support Beijing’s
territorial claims.”345
What is certain is that the method is well established: false or biased information
emerges on social media or on various forums, preferably with no visible link to the
CCP and is taken up and amplified by Chinese media, generally the Global Times,
which issues threats. This method may vary from full-fledged operations built from
scratch, for example when Chinese intelligence plants the initial information, to
sheer opportunism when the media identifies any piece of information that could be
damaging to Taiwan, irrespective of its origin.

V. Conclusion
The Chinese political warfare against Taiwan has won a few tactical victories to
the extent that it has contributed to polarizing the Taiwanese society and, thus, convinced a section of the public opinion that “Taiwan’s real enemy was the opposite camp
(the DPP) rather than the authoritarian regime across the Taiwan Strait.”346 Additionally,
it “may have helped a few politicians to get elected.”347 Some seduction methods,
notably through the business community, can work but others appear to be ineffective.
This is notably the case in the Taiwanese academic world which is well educated about the
Chinese threat and its methods: those who have been targeted by state-sponsored influence
peddling (luxurious trips to continental China, indoctrination sessions supervised by CCP
executives), returned without being converted by Chinese efforts and, if anything, rather
sarcastic about them, according to Cole: “I’ve had several interviews with the Taiwanese
academics who went on these trips to China, they come back and they tell me: `we had great
food, the hotel was nice […]. But did they succeed in brainwashing me or convincing me
that I’m something that I’m not? Absolutely not’. And they normally laugh it off saying that
the Chinese are spending a lot of money on these activities, and that the actual dividends are quite minimal.”348 The Chinese probably know that these measures are

not efficient; their justification is found only in the mechanisms of the Party-State
apparatus: certain operations are in fact the product of an administrative logic as
civil servants hope to show their hierarchy that they are doing something.
Strategically, this is a failure. In fact, the Chinese political warfare that targets
Taiwan has been counterproductive: incentives and punitive measures under Xi Jinping
have not produced the expected results; the majority of the Taiwanese population still
approves of the president and the DPP and is even more distrustful of China than before.
Beijing has even lost the KMT, which was once a useful CCP relay and is now distancing
itself from China and vice versa (Beijing said it “will no longer rely on the KMT”).349 Besides,
the 2020 presidential campaign confirmed the KMT’s loss of influence and the need for
Beijing to rely on other channels, usually not political parties, to reach out to the population,
and especially to the younger generations (China has lost its attractiveness among them
because of the China-US trade war and of the Hong Kong crisis). Moreover, the nationalist sentiment is rising: the number of people identifying as “only Taiwanese” has never
been higher (67%).350 The Hong Kong crisis has much to do with this since it played
a role as a powerful turnoff. Taiwan’s government subsequently adopted a series of
measures to combat interference – especially Chinese interference – which should make
influence peddling more difficult in the future. This also reinforced the Taiwanese government’s determination to reduce its dependence on China and to diversify its economy
– in particular in the sectors used by Beijing (i.e. tourism) to exert pressure.
Overall, Beijing’s mounting aggressiveness in recent years, against Taiwan and
globally, has considerably increased the island’s attractiveness. Without gaining any
formal diplomatic allies, Taiwan has seen its relations with the US strengthened with
the visit of the US Secretary of Health in August 2020 (the highest ranking US official to
visit the island since 1979), of an Under Secretary of State in September, and with the creation of a U.S. F-16 maintenance center, the only one in East Asia. The visit of an impressive Czech delegation in late August 2020 also brought international attention to the island
while incurring Beijing’s wrath. In a word, Chinese efforts to weaken and isolate Taiwan
have had the opposite effect of what they intended.

From Taiwan to Hong Kong and Back
What has been the link between Taiwan and Hong Kong since the beginning of the
Hong Kong crisis? Are the Chinese using the same methods and content in Taiwan as
they have in Hong Kong, or vice-versa? Both probably. There seems to be an adaptive
recycling of methods and content. On the one hand, the Hong Kong crisis contributed
to shaping the narratives used against Taiwan, such as the rumor according to which “the
Taiwanese government is interfering in the Hong-Kong crisis – by offering financial support”
(a Facebook post asserted that President Tsai Ing-wen spent a billion Taiwanese dollars (€29.5
million) to finance the protests in Hong Kong, all the while refusing to finance the fight against
a dengue outbreak that afflicted the south of Taiwan), or tactical support (the pro-Beijing press
in Hong Kong, picking up in Taiwan, claimed that Taiwanese agents were spotted advising the
protesters on the best way to face off against the police).351 More generally the Hong Kong crisis has not really had an impact on the frequency and the intensity of the informational attacks
against Taiwan: Beijing has the resources to operate on both fronts. However, the crisis has
had an impact on the narratives as they now focus less on unification (a delicate subject during
the Hong Kong crisis) and more on Taiwan’s internal issues (social problems).
On the other hand, among the 13.8 million tweets identified by Twitter in August and September
2019 as part of a pro-Beijing operation against Hong Kong, Taiwan was an issue. There were
attempts to promote Taiwanese pro-unification leaders such as the journalist Joyce Huang (黃
智賢) or the politician Wang Ping-chung (王炳忠), both known to have worked with Chinese
intelligence, something confirmed by several criminal investigations.352 Also, China seemingly used its Taiwanese allies to intervene in Hong Kong, because they could use traditional
Chinese characters. They were less susceptible to make mistakes than Chinese individuals from
the PRC, thus making them harder to detect.

INFORMATION OPERATIONS AGAINST
HONG KONG PROTESTERS IN 2019

Hong Kong was retroceded to China in 1997 after an agreement between the United
Kingdom and the PRC that preserved the existing political system in Hong Kong for 50
more years (in conformity with the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s “constitution”). This arrangement is commonly known as the “One Country, Two Systems,” and the island became a
“Special Administrative Region” (特别行政区–SAR) with its own judicial and political
system. The PRC’s authority is represented by the Liaison Office of the Central People’s
Government in the Hong Kong SAR (中央人民政府驻香港特别行政区联络办公), aka
the Liaison Office.
Throughout the winter of 2019 a bill on extraditions to China angered the population,
which began to protest against it. The movement intensified as the police repressed them.
The June 16 protests gathered a record two million people according to the organizers, but
confrontations with the police became more violent. And tensions culminated during
the summer and fall of 2019. In this context, Beijing conducted a number of influence and disinformation operations against protesters using three narrative lines: support for the police and the Hong Kong government, attacks against the reputation of
protesters, and accusations of foreign interference.1-2

I. Beijing’s difficulties in imposing its narratives on the
protests
On the ground, the Chinese regime proved unable to anticipate the size of an opposition or to understand the movement’s evolution and the meteoric decline of executive head
Carrie Lam’s standing in the public opinion. The failure of the Liaison Office’s representative was also obvious. In this regard, images of protesters surrounding the Liaison Office
and trampling the PRC’s flag were seen as a clear affront to the CCP. Surprised by the
scale of the protests and the inability of Lam’s government to restore order, the CCP was
forced to react quickly. The Party’s margin for maneuver was slim however since Hong
Kong remains largely autonomous and a direct coercive action would only have come at a
high political price, detrimental to the CCP’s public image – and completely demonetizing

the rhetoric of the “One country, Two systems” in the eyes of the people of Hong Kong
but also in Taiwan.
Faced with this humiliation that rapidly tested the Chinese regime’s capacity to restore
its authority – in China strictly speaking as much as in Hong Kong or within its population
– Beijing’s response turned to the informational sphere.
Beijing’s counter-attack faced three challenges. Its discourse had to address three target audiences simultaneously: (1) mainland public opinion, which was the easiest to
channel, as information is tightly controlled behind “the Great Chinese Firewall” with
the Propaganda Department setting the tone and Chinese media falling behind; (2) Hong
Kong’s public opinion, and more generally the Chinese diaspora, especially in North
America and Europe; and (3) the non-Chinese-speaking international public opinion.
The challenge for China was to retain a minimum of its capital for sympathy: the
protests indeed attracted the attention of foreign media to the situation in Hong Kong and
naturally to the management of the crisis by the Party. However, the Chinese government
was facing a complex international environment, under growing criticisms and hostility with
the “trade war” it faces with the U.S. administration, the backlash against its colonization
policy in Xinjiang and its increasingly brazen constraints on public liberties for instance.
Beijing’s real margin for maneuver was slimmer than appeared at first glance.
The regime’s objective was to spread counter-narratives that could be heard and
accepted by all three audiences. The channels and languages used to diffuse these narratives were numerous. On the one hand, in the Chinese-speaking world, Beijing essentially
used sealed-off ecosystems like WeChat, Weibo and Douyin (the continental version of
TikTok), in which only content that conform to the mainland’s laws and rules can circulate
(→ p. 196). These platforms are widely used by overseas Chinese and constitute an efficient
way to influence the diasporas. On the other hand, to shape international public opinion
Beijing mostly used U.S. platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, banned in China,
and the Chinese TikTok. Social media occupied an important role in the Chinese communication strategy regarding Hong Kong but traditional media were not neglected either.

II. The Chinese media’s narrative
The Chinese government’s spokespeople often complain about the foreign media coverage of the PRC. This coverage is often considered to be too negative and too ignorant of
the successes of the Communist Party to focus on “smear” campaigns instead. This tactic
or posture as a victim, which consists in criticizing the coverage of China in western
media, is the main – and most commonly used – method to influence a public opinion. The
target audience is just as much that of China as that of the diaspora and sometimes even
certain fringes of the international public opinion (the far left and the far right in European
liberal democracies for example).
On the continent the Party can rely on its well-oiled propaganda apparatus and
its network of censors to steer the public’s attitude to the protests. David Bandurski from
the China Media Project analyzed the methods and narratives used to achieve this goal on the
continent.3 Along with big official daily newspapers, he noted the importance of numerous
WeChat accounts massively posting “low quality” articles or junk propaganda. These articles

serve to inflame public opinions through carefully selected and powerfully divisive content
(desacralized flag, imputing acts of violence to protesters or even “proof ” of foreign interference– most notably from the CIA). This content, largely spread on the web, can be likened to political “spam” aiming to drown a public opinion in manipulated content.

Examples of articles posted around October 8, 2020 on WeChat after an Internet
search for “the bandits of Hong Kong” (香港暴徒).4

In Hong Kong, however, the Chinese government could not directly censor or influence the protesters’ media narrative. The Liaison Office did have relays in public opinion inasmuch as it had acquired publishing houses or formed close links with a number
of daily newspapers and tabloids beforehand,5 but the CCP could not control flows
of information on social media as it did on mainland platforms. Besides, Beijing
announced its decisions, at least officially, to let the Hong Kong government handle the
protests. All the declarations from the Liaison Office, or from the general secretary of the
CCP Xi Jinping, displayed the “CCP’s confidence in the Hong Kong government.” The
Party-State’s actions kept a low profile and strived to unite the “loyalist” forces with a
dual strategy: forcing the hand of Hong Kong’s institutions (firms like Cathay Pacific,
the Mass Transit Railway or the Ministry of Justice for instance) but also playing the longterm game of letting the opposition movement wither away, collapse or be discredited
because of the protesters’ violence and radicalization.
The channels used to get this type of messages through varied. Aside from the declarations of official representatives and organized protests against certain TV channels (illustrated by the 41-page letter sent in late August 2019 to prominent international newspapers
and press agencies),6 the task of amplifying the message was mostly assigned to official Chinese media.7 For instance, a Google search for “Hong Kong media coverage
biased” returned several videos posted mainly in August 2019 by CGTN, CCTV or even
China News.

4. This is only a sample among hundreds of proposed search results. In his article, David Bandurski and his team
have listed more than 200 published in July. See “暴徒以镭射笔照射军营 _驻港部队首次 ‘警告’” (“Rioters Shine

Another example of this type of content designed to spread Beijing’s narrative was analyzed by David Bandurski.9 On August 1, 2019, the PLA broadcast a video from a training
of its Hong Kong garrison on Chinese public television. This video, which showed PLA
soldiers training to disperse protesters by force, was widely taken up by the “pro-Beijing”
opinion as a guarantee that the “motherland” would not abandon the “loyalists,” but also by
the protesters themselves to illustrate the threat China represented. The video was shared
by several official accounts (PLA, China Daily) in English and Chinese, totaling tens of
thousands of views. It is still available today. In fact, the threat of an armed intervention
was used recurrently as part of a Chinese strategy of gradually imposing more pressure
on protesters, as testified by the announcements made on August 12,1018,11and 28.12
The state media’s strategy seemingly favored shocking content that could catch the
attention, spark a debate and generate views. For example, a TV clip compared Hong
Kong protesters with jihadist terrorists for the way they presumably instrumentalized
children (see the screenshot below).13 Posted on Facebook in mid-September, this video
was later broadcast by the main Chinese media channels (Global Times, China Daily, etc.).

III. The Example of Guancha
The official social media accounts of certain Chinese media outlets played a central role
in spreading anti-protest narratives and similar iconographies.14 “RealGuancha” in particular played a prominent role. Guancha (观察) is a popular Chinese news website in the
style of Jimian (界面), Sina (新浪) or Global Times ((环球时报). If Global Times was already
well-known on Western social media (particularly Twitter) for its nationalist remarks and
clear-cut stances, the Guancha platform had not been noticed outside of China at that
point. But its Twitter account, created in March 2019, turned out to be very active and
virulent in its coverage of the protests.

The Twitter account @realGuancha mostly shared content in Chinese but not only.
Posts from October 7 (see above) showed the destructions of shops and boutiques belonging to mainland franchises and brands. These undeniable acts of violence were depicted
as a generalized pillaging and even as “pogroms” (targeting mainland Chinese residents). On the screenshot on the left, the sentence “[if] you commit a crime, is an apology
enough?” was a reference to the initiatives of moderate protesters who wanted to apologize
for the violence.
Hence, the @realGuancha account published content intended to divide, like the content circulated on WeChat or Weibo. Even if it remained a small account (more than 32,000

subscribers on March 21, 2021), its growth during this period was significant: it went from
2,000 subscribers on October 6, 2019 to 3,543 on the 19th – a 77% increase in two weeks.
Extremely active, it posted no fewer than 750 messages during the same period (from
1,800 tweets on October 6 to 2,550 on the 19th) for an average of 57.7 messages a day.
According to the Accountanalysis application, a peak of activity was registered on October
1, 2019, during the national holiday of the PRC, with 633 messages.
Guancha was present not only on Twitter: it was just as active on YouTube, with at
least a hundred videos uploaded between October 3 and 6 on its YouTube channel.15 All
these videos showed images of violent protesters and highlighted their acts of violence.
Quality and length varied but they all seemed to originate from different sources, having
been filmed by Hong Kong locals and mainland Chinese citizens in Hong Kong. Very few
of these videos seemed to have been the object of a journalistic approach, or even edited,
and on the whole they resembled a compilation of amateur videos rather than a careful
montage.
These posts were frequently posted, almost akin to a saturation attack, and it led people to believe that the objective was not to inform. Guancha aimed to flood platforms
with a counter-discourse favorable to the “loyalists.”
Jimmy Sham’s “self-mutilation”
On October 16, the activist Jimmy Sham, who had organized numerous peaceful protests that
rallied several hundred thousand Hongkongers, was targeted and beaten by a group of men
armed with hammers and iron bars. On October 19, Guancha posted a video entitled “Jimmy
Sham’s self-mutilation” (岑子杰的苦肉计 – “kurouji” which means “to wound oneself to
gain the enemy’s trust”).16 The video shows the blood-stained scene of the attack with Jimmy
Sham lying on the ground. Then Sham was shown at the hospital the day after the attack, smiling. The innuendo was clear: if he had been as gravely wounded as he claimed how could he
only have had a little plaster on his forehead and be seen smiling, as if he had never felt better?

The case of Jimmy Sham’s “self-mutilation” is only one example among dozens of videos uploaded on October 19 at an industrial pace – by midday ten videos had been
posted in two hours. They covered news related to the movement while, of course, offering an “alternative” point of view. For example, on “the list of the cockroaches’ crimes”
(曱甴罪行錄CASE 01),17 we found videos showing the “truth” behind the case of a young
15-year-old girl whose lifeless body was found in the port. These videos insinuated that it had
just been a suicide and that other explanations were mere rumors to defame and humiliate
the police.18 Despite these suspicious messages, Guancha was not one of the 210 accounts
suspended by YouTube.19 According to YouTube, the accounts affiliated to Guancha
used VPNs to post videos on its platform. Even if the firm announced that this discovery “was consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by
Facebook and Twitter,” it was not able to establish a clear link between these activities
and the PRC, unlike for the two other platforms.

IV. The use of social networks with an international audience
A. TikTok
As we explained in part three (→ p. 200), TikTok is censored and instrumentalized by Chinese authorities. For instance, The Washington Post observed that a search for
“#hongkong” on the application gave no result tied to the protests.20 And “violence in
Hong Kong” (香港暴力) mainly returned videos from official media which unanimously
condemned the protesters’ “terrorism.”

On August 19, 2019, Facebook deleted seven pages, three groups and five accounts that
showed “coordinated inauthentic behavior” from a network that “originated in China and
focused on Hong Kong.”21 These pages compared the protesters to cockroaches and
terrorists, among other posts. They also posted photo montages showing armed protesters, or police officers being attacked.
If the content was certainly shocking, it was removed for another reason: Facebook, in
accordance with its rules, suspended these pages, groups and accounts because of
their inauthentic and coordinated (i.e. manipulative) behavior and not because of the content they were disseminating.

The massive disinformation campaign organized by China is most visible on
Twitter. On August 19, 2019, the same day as Facebook (which had been tipped off by
Twitter), the platform made public a “significant state-backed information operation”: the company explained that it had deleted around 200,000 fake accounts implicated
in a campaign meant to “[undermine] the legitimacy and political positions of the [Hong
Kong] protest movement” and it published the archives of the 936 most active of these
accounts, all “originating from within the PRC.”22 A month later, on September 20,
Twitter published the archives of another batch of 4,301 accounts, which were also among
the most active in this operation.23

China Hong, based in Singapore. Particularly quick to respond, the ASPI published its report,
Tweeting through the Great Firewall, on September 3, only two weeks after the data was published by
Twitter.24 The report dweals on the means used by Beijing to build its disinformation campaign
as well as its targets, but does not confine itself to Hong Kong since it gies examples of older
campaigns targeting political opponents such as Guo Wengui and Gui Minhai.

1. A Typology of the accounts involved in the disinformation campaign
First preliminary observation: this campaign was conducted in haste. The ASPI
noted that the operators behind the surge did not take the time to build credible digital
identities, unlike the Russian operators who had attacked the presidential campaign in 2016.
Of course the difference is that the calendar for the U.S. election was pre-established,
allowing the attackers to prepare their operations several years in advance and to patiently
build an “infrastructure of influence,” whereas the Hong Kong crisis was unexpected and
evolved quickly. The modus operandi of the disinformation campaign had to be adapted at
the last moment, taking “shortcuts” to buy time, such as purchasing existing accounts for
instance, which made the operation quite easy to detect.25
Two types of Twitter accounts used against Hong Kong protesters need to be
analyzed separately: on the one hand, there were “mercenaries,” which previously used
different languages (English, Indonesian, Korean, Japanese, Russian) to post content ranging
from English football to pornographic messages (sex dating websites, escort services), or
even information about Korean boy bands. Having been bought, these accounts changed
their language and cause overnight, thereafter defending Beijing and going after Hong Kong
protesters. Selling accounts is a common practice already mentioned in part three (→ p. 375).
On the other hand, there were also “dormant” accounts: among the data published by
Twitter, ASPI identified 233 accounts where there were intervals of at least a year between
two tweets. Among them, the oldest had been created in December 2007.
Their interest in Hong Kong intensified in May (one day before Carrie Lam suspended
the extradition bill) and June 2019 (with the “capture” of the Legislative Council by the protesters).26 Even if the tweets referencing Hong Kong were only a small part of the sampled
data, the ASPI identified three main narratives: a rejection of the protesters and the
condemnation of their positions, support for the Hong Kong police and the “rule of law,”
and finally conspiracy theories suggesting “Westerners” were involved in the protests.
Hastily organized and lacking technical means, the ASPI describes a “blunt” influence
operation. The method was similar to those used in mainland China, where censors often
use spams to flood public opinion with certain types of content, and to armies of Weibo
accounts paid to plaster official messages under certain types of posts globally.27
Chua Chin Hong, a Singapore-based specialist on Chinese media proposed a more granulated analysis of the second batch of data published by Twitter (ten million tweets) that
refines our understanding of the campaign. These tweets, posted between May and July 2019,
represented a “campaign surge” which “could ironically be one of the key reasons

the accounts disseminated 87,000 tweets and retweets (but only 27,000 original tweets). The
overwhelming majority of these messages were in Chinese with only 6% in English. 28
One indication of the artificial nature of these accounts was their lack of experience
using Twitter, which is banned in China. For instance, Chua highlighted that many of the
accounts unknowingly posted the welcome message on Twitter (“Just setting up my twitter
#myfirstTweet”), before they started to successively retweet the “lead” accounts. For the
Singaporean analyst, one of the main clues to the “massive and coordinated” nature of
the disinformation campaign could be found in the accounts’ dates of creation. Indeed,
as the ASPI study showed, the accounts removed in August were rather old. In the September
archive, the accounts were far more recent: out of the 4,301 accounts listed more than half
(54%) were created during the previous three months. The largest spike in creation was
on June 14 – one day before the extradition bill was suspended – but the analyst remained
prudent and, in the absence of proof of any coordination, spoke only of a coincidence.

2. Spam and dormant accounts
Another analyst, “AirMovingDevice,” underlines several other characteristics.29 First, the
tweets were synchronized with Beijing’s time zone: the time slots during which the majority of the tweets were published did not correspond to the local time zone (that is to say with
the geographical zones advertised by Internet users) but to Beijing’s. Moreover, like the ASPI,
AirMovingDevice highlighted long periods of dormancy or non-activity in many
accounts (nearly 41%). He described the following model: the accounts were created before
2018, posted in different languages, and then remained inactive for more or less long periods of
time. They were reactivated around 2018-2019 and started posting in Chinese.
The analyst gave the example of 披荆斩棘 (#saydullos1d), a female user presumably based
in Colorado.30 This account, created in 2013, posted mainly in English on topics linked to hunting and fishing, without ever being retweeted or “liked.” She then progressively disappeared
from the radars before reappearing in 2018. During these five years, she had “learned Chinese”
and “developed a passion for butterflies,” for a few weeks at least. But this passion mysteriously
evaporated to make room for Chinese tabloids. AirMovingDevice then showed that she spread
content found on Weibo, even going as far as posting 1,000 messages in 2018. Then, in June
2019, she suddenly started to retweet numerous messages condemning Hong Kong protesters.
“Qujianming” was another example analyzed by Chua Chin Hong. Immediately suspect,
Qujianming boasted 28,000 subscribers for 24,000 subscriptions, but, as Chua explained, it
is rare for accounts to have that many subscriptions. Qujianming mainly tweeted in Chinese
and called for “severe punishment for the violent protesters, systematically described as
rioters (暴徒 – hooligans, thugs)” – who were accused of following their own interests only
(and not those of Hong Kong).

3. Case Study
In a complementary approach to the essentially quantitative studies published by the ASPI in
2019, and in order to better understand the methods used by Beijing to influence and manipulate
online discourse, we conducted a qualitative investigation on Twitter and Facebook.
28. Hon, “Failed Surge.”

a. Methodology
We chose to start with hashtags, that are a signature for the digital narratives and the narrative communities that conveyed them, to further investigate
some emblematic Twitter accounts. This approach has several advantages: first, a
hashtag is often used and shared by large groups of users at the same time, but it
nonetheless remains defined and intelligible. In the case of the Hong Kong protests,
each “side” defended its representations through clearly differentiated and divisive
hashtags. Sometimes the two sides fought over the same hashtags (#HongKongPolice
for instance), with one side defending the actions of the Hong Kong riot police, and
the other condemning their violent actions. In other words, hashtags were a point of
convergence for the different sides and a structuring force for their discourses – a
shared signature of some sort. As markers, they helped identify a group of relatively homogeneous users. This also allowed us to study the users’ discourse,
which involved various channels (tweets, images, memes, allusions, wordplays, etc.).
Finally, the hashtag is also a time marker, since it allows us to date its first use (and
sometimes its decline). For all these reasons, our study analyzes of a set of hashtags
used in September and October 2019.
Starting with these hashtags (listed below), we chose representative accounts based
on three criteria that questioned their authenticity: anonymous user IDs (a Twitter
user ID made of a word, or part of a word, with many numbers); a linguistic dissonance (IDs using a “Western-sounding name” but tweeting only in Chinese); and their
non-linearity or non-regularity (accounts that boasted more than 5,000 subscribers
or subscriptions a few months after their creation, or accounts that had been inactive
for a long time but suddenly starting to tweet in Chinese).
These suspicious accounts were then analyzed in more details with the help of opensource research tools (OSINT) such as “tinfoleaks” or “accountanalysis,” which gave us
the precise date of an account’s creation, the date of the first tweet, the hashtags used,
and so on. This method was relatively efficient: half the accounts quoted in our investigation have since been suspended (between the last weeks of September and mid-October
2019).
The research on these accounts focused on the period that started on September
20 and ended on October 20, 2019. The advanced research tools provided by Twitter
made it possible to target certain phrases, enabling us to concentrate on the events
that shaped this period: the protests of September 28 and October 1, and those
that followed the adoption of the law outlawing masks during demonstrations. The
choice of this one-month period allows us to propose an analysis that takes into
account the evolution of the methods and narratives used during this period, but
also to propose an original qualitative study that goes beyond a mere observation of
the virality of the messages. We formulate hypotheses regarding the intentions and
strategies that could have underlain their publication, thus complementing already
existing studies. The analysis hopes to show the technical levers used with Twitter
accounts and, therefore, their non-authentic or “unnatural” character (inherent to
their irregular uses).

b. Reactivated dormant accounts
• @loverealface2 (active until October 9, the day it was suspended) was registered in the
United States. Created in December 2017, it boasted 5,100 subscribers (5,800 subscriptions) and only posted 56 tweets after its creation. The long period of inactivity between
August 2018 and September 17, 2019 made it suspicious.
It last tweeted in English in August 2018. And, from September 2019 on, it tweeted in
Cantonese when covering Hong Kong and, more rarely, in Mandarin when dealing with
“personal messages” (for example a message about a trip to Yunnan).

We give two examples of tweets posted by @loverealface2 here: the first (see below,
left) accused Joshua Wong, Jimmy Lai, Anson Chan, and Martin Lee of having “collaborated” with the “exterior anti-Chinese forces” (境外反华势力) to organize a color
revolution (颜色革命) in Hong Kong. The photo showed a “calm, clean” Hong Kong
that contrasted with the mass of umbrellas. The message meant “let Hong Kong recover
her past glow (glory).” The second picture (see below, right), exploited the theme of the
collaboration with “exterior anti-Chinese forces.” Joshua Wong was accused of wanting
to destroy the social order and to break the “One country, Two systems” compromise.
The photo was supposed to represent a U.S. diplomat having dinner with several pro-democracy figures.
• @Nirmala1244 (last consulted on October 3, and suspended around October 9) was
created in March 2019. For someone who tweeted very little (only 21 tweets), the account
boasted 5,000 subscribers and 5,400 subscriptions. This account posted in Mandarin and
Cantonese and wrote “personal” tweets (which had very little to do with the Hong Kong
protests). Furthermore, between April 8 and July 24, the account was barely active, with
only three visible messages. The peak of its activity occurred between September 21 and
October 1 – not unlike @loverealface2 – which could mean there was a rapid campaign
in the lead up to October 1. The content of the tweets was similar to that of @loverealface2: patriotic images and others meant to tarnish the protesters.

Above are two tweets that @Nirmala1244 posted. The first (on the left) questioned
foreign influence: in this case one person presumably met with a foreign diplomat to discuss the protests. The message mentioned “meetings” between foreign agents and protests leaders. The second tweet (on the right) criticized the fact that protesters allegedly
“used” children to conduct their violent acts.
• @FunnybonesBob (consulted on October 2, suspended on October 10) had 5,400
accounts and collected 5,100 subscribers. Created in November 2017, it did not tweet
between March 2018 and September 2019 and had only published 37 tweets in total.
Most of the tweets were old and they discussed an application that supposedly “cleans”
Twitter profiles and subscriptions in particular.31 This account only became active in
September 2019 and more precisely on September 30, with only a few tweets that took
up the iconography linking protesters to the Ku Klux Klan; another tweet drew an analogy between protesters and saboteurs.
• @Lancy39681596 was also very active. Its number of subscribers grew sharply: from
1,720 on October 10 to more than 2,000 on October 19. In addition, it published more
than 12,000 tweets after its creation, five months earlier, in May 2019. Even more troubling was the frequency with which this account sent messages. On Sunday, October 6,
as major protests took place in Hong Kong in reaction to the law banning the wearing
of masks, @Lancy39681596 sent nearly 1,400 tweets between 7am and 10pm. In comparison, on Saturday October 5, the account sent “only” 387 tweets.

On Sunday, October 6, @Lancy39681596 was particularly moved by the violence perpetrated by protestors (in particular against a cab driver, stores, and individuals). It also
presented cases of looting of Chinese stores or simply of “ordinary citizens” by Hong
Kong protesters. The tweets were often bilingual (the screenshots above were taken on
October 5).
• @anyaafairy, another suspicious account, was consulted on October 14 and 18, and
suspended around October 20. This account was typical of the “improvements” made
to more basic accounts. @anyaafairy claimed to be a roleplay “NSFW” account (not safe
for work, i.e. erotic or sexual), and its profile picture was stolen from a real Thai model.32
The account had over 12,000 followers and fewer than 130 subscriptions. In other words,
it was at first glance an “authentic” account. However, in its three years of existence,
it tweeted only 234 times. Only a dozen tweets were visible at the time the account was
consulted in October 2019, with the oldest dating back to October 7. On average, two out
of three (visible) tweets were about Hong Kong and published in Mandarin.

The user deplored that, since June, more than 4,200 meters of railing, close to 400 lamp
posts and traffic lights, 2,600 square meters of asphalt and 1,700 items of city property
had been destroyed by rioters.
• @TXT_Tathyunnn (last accessed on October 18, suspended on October 30) was a
fan-made account about Kang Tae Hyun, one of the singers of the Korean K-pop group
“TXT Tomorrow-X-Together.” It was not the official account of the boys band. Created
in August 2015, it posted 8,800 tweets, with 19,000 followers and barely 50 subscriptions.
At its creation and until April 2019, it behaved “normally”: retweets of the band’s official
account (in Korean), pictures of the singers, etc. Then, between April and October 7,
2019, the account was completely inactive. In early October, the account posted a series
of photographs of members of the band but without text. Then, on October 9, the
account tweeted in traditional Mandarin to criticize the Hong Kong protesters, following
a model similar to the tweets mentioned above (infographics/photos, videos and comments). The account kept tweeting about the members of the Korean K-pop group but
tweets became less frequent and interspersed with other tweets about Hong Kong. TXT
also tweeted in Cantonese and English, and seemingly focused on looting and violence.

• Our last examples show the reactivity of these accounts’ operators, in this instance
their ability to quickly activate fallback accounts. The account @CrealDllmhg, consulted on October 14, but since suspended, was a particularly active account with almost
1,100 tweets and 1,300 subscribers in its three months of existence.33 On October 17,
however, another account @DllmhgCreal, created in July 2019 with the same profile
picture, and around 1,300 subscribers, resumed its activities.34 The content was very similar to what was already presented: highlighting the protesters’ violence was its leitmotiv.
They were often compared to terrorists. Each misdeed was scrutinized (or made up) and
the messages recycled the specificities we have observed on WeChat: shocking images
and titles that sought to prompt indignation, etc.

c. “Relay accounts”
In this study we also noted numerous accounts with a marginal audience, i.e. only a
few subscribers and subscriptions. These accounts seemed to simply retweet and share
the content disseminated by the more important accounts presented above. We named
these “relay accounts.”
There are many such fake accounts, but we could also find many “micro users” among
them who try to go undetected by Twitter moderators. For example, “Wurufan” (务如凡
@kWz33lF6nCU9Z7E – last accessed on October 19) was one account whose user33. See the archive we made: https://archive.fo/ozJfK.

name seemed to have been randomly generated by computer. Not very active (123
tweets between its creation in July 2019 and October 10), the account had only five subscriptions and only one subscriber. Its first message dated from September 10 and they all
followed the same principle. The account retweeted and commented on messages coming
from bigger accounts (such as those quoted previously). The first tweets sent on September
10 actually relayed messages from accounts which are now suspended.

Many accounts like this one took turns to generate content online. The account @
BeverleyMclare3, active on October 9, was suspended the next day; a similar account,
@RuthannGant9, created in September 2019 (accessed on October 9 – 2 subscriptions,
2 followers, 28 tweets), used the same codes; it subscribed to two other fake accounts @
anntaranti and @MaThao91, both created in September 2019, with one or no subscriber.
If they had been created in September, they apparently did not start tweeting until early
October, which would indicate that they were back-up or secondary accounts. Both
accounts were accessed on October 9 and suspended the next day. It is likely that these
accounts are regularly suspended and then reprogrammed. A new example is provided by
@UshaBoardman (account accessed on October 14, suspended on the 16th) created on
September 23 and almost inactive until October 14.
Another peculiarity is that most of these “new” accounts used Western names. For
instance, @GillianMonteith and @MarineMcgregor5 were two accounts that tweeted
only in Mandarin about Hong Kong-related topics. These accounts were not the most influential because their audience was after all inexistent, but they revealed the Chinese strategy
described in the ASPI reports or in other studies.

d. Anti-protester hashtags, narratives and iconographies
The following texts were collected from hashtags used both in English and in Chinese.
Generally, the tweets did not contain more than three or four keywords, among which we
always found “Hong Kong” / “香港.” Here is an overview of the main hashtags:

These hashtags can be classified into two groups: those displaying patriotism or
nationalism (particularly among Diba members) and those which specifically covered
protests in Hong Kong (either by supporting the police or disparaging the protesters).
To get a better understanding of the anti-protester narratives disseminated on Twitter
one need to study the content of the tweets and images. The two main lines of attack
were the alleged violence of protesters (drawing an analogy with terrorists, highlighting
the pillaging, accusations of rape, of lynching, etc.) and the alleged manipulations of
“foreign anti-Chinese forces.” Hereafter we show several tweets and infographics, both
in English and Chinese, which are representative of these topics.

On image #1, the first strip shows protesters as cockroaches yelling “five demands and
not one less” (the protesters’ slogan), “I want to break stuff, hit people and stop them from
going back to work or to school.” On the strip at the bottom, under the red title (“Once
the law prohibiting the wearing of masks is enacted”), the “protester” on the right in the
foreground says to his comrade: “Come on, you go first,” the other answers: “Errrrr ok,
but I’m scared…” This image posted in late September 2019 was supposed to illustrate
the fact that protesters only dared follow through with their actions because they
felt protected by the anonymity provided by masks.
The main message was that masked protesters were violent, that they hid real weaponry (Image #2), and caused major damage (Image #3).

A particularly predominant leitmotiv advanced that protesters behaved more violently
than the police. A number of posters and messages highlighted the acts of violence presumably committed by protesters against the police (Image #4). For example, Image
#5, posted by Guancha, showed the following: “Neither peaceful nor reasonable,” followed
by the caption “Peaceful? Reasonable? Certainly not!” Guancha was here trying to demonetize the values exhibited by protesters (“we are peaceful and reasonable”) to better discredit
them.

While certain images denounced the protesters’ violence against the police, others praised
the attitude of the police in regard to the “thugs” (Images #6 and #7). This very cinematic
style could also be found among both protesters and “counter-protesters.” Once again the
role of Guancha in the dissemination of this content was noteworthy.

Another angle was the “whataboutism,” a form of sophistry which was about trying to
create a diversion by invoking a different target. For example, in response to what was perceived as the biased Western coverage of the Hong Kong crisis, criticizing the violence of
the police and Beijing’s support, many influential Chinese-speaking accounts turned these
criticisms back against the West using comparisons – especially to the U.S. police, as we saw
in part three (→ p. 385) and as illustrated by Images #8 and #9.

D. The new corps of volunteers on Weibo
In mainland China, Weibo is the equivalent of Twitter, and its content is strictly regulated (→ p. 199), as with all the Chinese platforms. However, Weibo plays an essential role
in the “fans’ economy.” Weibo is very lucrative for movie, reality TV, and music stars who
have mastered mobilizing their communities.35 The race for popularity on this network has
pushed many users to organize themselves in militant communities in order to support
their idols or pay “water armies” (水军)36 to artificially increase the popularity of a
star (or product) on the network. Weibo is thus a permanent battlefield between different
communities of users defending their favorite celebrities.37

1. Diba
A well-known example among Chinese users is the group “Li Yi Ba” (李毅吧), which
has morphed over time to become “Diba” (帝吧). “Liyiba” was originally a sub-section
of an online forum named “tieba,” a community of users known for mocking a football
player named Li Yi. It progressively became more organized and now regularly leads
“campaigns” (出征 – as in “military campaigns”) against targets “outside the Great
Chinese firewall” under the slogan “[when] Diba launches a military expedition not a blade
of grass is spared” (帝吧出征，寸草不生). For instance, Diba attacked the Facebook
page of the newly-elected head of the Taiwanese government Tsai Ing-Wen38 and

essentially active in China’s peripheral environment (Taiwan and Hong Kong notably),
its campaigns can also strike more distant targets: they attacked the satirical Swedish
show Svenska Nyheter in September 2018 (→ p. 532) and the Danish daily newspaper
Jyllands-Posten in January 2020, after the publication of a caricature representing the flag
of the PRC with the characteristics of the coronavirus.39

by the Danish daily newspaper Jyllands-Posten on January 28, 2020, triggered a campaign
by pro-Chinese trolls which Diba partly led, against the paper and Denmark more generally.

On Twitter, the group Diba used the account @D8China. Thanks to Twint, we were
able to collect all the published tweets before the account was deleted in late October or early
November 2019. The first was posted in April 2019 and targeted activist groups defending
the rights of the Muslim Uyghur minority (and not Hong Kong demonstrators). The account
showed its successes through an article it shared.40 @D8China did not participate in targeted
campaigns but played the role of a propagandist, highlighting Diba’s successes and relaying
Beijing’s watchwords: territorial unity, the fight against “biased Western media,” etc.
On Facebook, Diba has several official groups (and pages). Foremost among these is
“Diba’s army group center” (帝吧中央集团军) created in 2015.41-42 In October 2019, it had
83,000 members including 3,000 new members that subscribed during the previous 30 days.
Diba also had several Facebook groups intended to organize its activities: “Diba’s campaign
to protect Hong Kong” (帝吧出征守护香港),43 created in July 2019 with 8,000 members
(October 2019), but also “Diba’s base of operations,” created in April 2016 and which had
22,000 members (October 2019).44 To join some of these groups, administrators impose rules
or submit users to questions which often consists in showing off one’s patriotism.
Diba was supposed to launch a campaign (出征) against Hong Kong protesters on
July 23, but it was brought forward to July 22 and the announcement was made on the
39. Diba’s implication was confirmed during our interviews in Denmark.

group’s Weibo account.45-46 The pages of certain Hong Kong protesters’ support
groups were targeted in a well-defined modus operandi: the attackers copied and pasted
messages (often the same messages) one after another to saturate the spaces. However,
this time Diba was quickly detected and its main operators “doxxed”: their names,
addresses, telephone numbers and bank account details were made public and some of
these were used for enrolment applications in the PLA. The main operation was apparently
cancelled by the organizers for fear of reprisals.47

2. Fanquan
Another operation was apparently conducted between August 14 and 17, 2019 and this
time by a set of groups called “饭圈女孩” (fanquan nühai).48 Literally translated as
the “girls of the fan circle,” this was a group of young Internet users (most often high
school girls) deeply involved in the “pursuit of stars” (追星– zhuixing).49 There were in fact
different groups of fans of pop idols who “joined together” to help and support “阿中”
(a-zhong) or 阿中哥哥 (a-zhong gege) – or, in other words, China.50 These fans developed a
whole iconography based on “gifs” or memes (humoristic Internet images – biaoqing bao (表
情包 in Chinese)). And they responded to hashtags on Weibo such as “守护全世界最好的
阿中” (“Let us, in all corners of the world, protect the greatest China!”).51 A search with this
hashtag on Weibo returned a frenzy of activities over the slightest subject that involved China,
such as the NBA, Huawei, the military parade of October 1 and, of course, Hong Kong.
Furthermore, the “fan girls” also have a Twitter account, @520CHINA666,52 created
in June 2019 and suspended in late October. When we created our archive, around October
25, the account had published nearly 3,700 tweets (we were able to collect around 1,000).
In October, the fanquan boasted 5,000 subscribers and 55 subscriptions. In comparison to
Diba’s account, this one was more aggressive insofar as it actually answered (often with
insults) Internet users who favored democracy.53

3. Coordinated actions
The peak in activity of both Diba and Fanquan groups apparently occurred between August
14 and 20. Chinese websites spoke of the “814大团结” (“the Grand Unity of August 14”):
that day, different fan groups came together to lead a highly “disciplined” attack
against China’s enemies. Diba and Fanquan groups apparently led the charge. This attack

49. In the West, the importance of media consumerism and the fascination generated by pop-stars and other
idols is seldom understood. This economy is also a very proactive social movement (with extremely organized online
groups) that does not hesitate to use its striking force to support their artists or, like in this case, conduct campaigns
against their adversaries.

was in fact a meme war meant to control the comment section on the adversary’s posts,
to stop them from disseminating thir version of events and even to block their page.
On August 15, Guancha (→ p. 491) wrote an article about this symbolic victory.54
Another wave of coordinated attacks reportedly took place on August 17.55 More than an
“offensive campaign,” this “operation” aimed to stimulate patriotism and was supported by
the pro-Beijing Hong Kong representative Junius Ho.56 The day before, Diba’s official Weibo
account issued a mobilization order. This message, “虽千万人吾往矣” (“even in the face of
ten million, I shall advance”), was a quote from the Confucian theorist Mencius. It accompanied instructions on how to “defend the right of the Hong Kong police to arrest protesters”
(坚决支持香港警察依法拘捕暴徒). According to Guancha, who used screenshots as evidence, these groups were organized around QQ groups and into “regiments” (团). For
the occasion “reinforcement” groups from China (阿中后援团) were formed.
In terms of content the groups’ administrators provided the “ammunitions” (阿中
后援): images of violent protesters, phrases and messages previously prepared in Chinese
and English.
It is worth noting that the members of these groups took up the
codes of Hong Kong protesters only to turn them against them.
For instance, echoing the “five demands” of the protesters,57
they issued “five positive demands” (5大正能量诉求 – see picture on the left): an end to violence (止暴制乱), the restoration
of order (恢复秩序), severe punishments for the rioters (严惩
暴徒), attack on lawlessness (打击违法), fair coverage of the
news (公正报道).
In parallel to this type of targeted content, Diba’s Twitter group
asked its subscribers to spread messages of support on the Hong Police Facebook and
Twitter groups.58
Of course these actions encountered difficulties: Facebook and Twitter are banned in
China. Diba and Fanquan “soldiers” had to “cross the wall” (翻墙 – a word used to
mean “go around the great Chinese firewall”). Diba’s Facebook page seemed to give
instructions and technical advice on how to do it (see below).59 Included among the
ammunition, were “instruction manuals on how to use foreign social media and methods to avoid the blocking attempts (spam accounts) of foreign social platforms” (针对各
大海外社交平台制作了扫盲教程、防封号教程).60 On Twitter (see below) one account
advised “young patriots” (爱国青年) to use a VPN (theoretically banned by the Chinese

authorities) and an “accelerator” (加速器) called “Ant Accelerator” (蚂蚁加速器) to cross
the wall and thus contribute to China’s defense. On Weibo, another account explained that
the government “tacitly blessed” these illegal practices (see below).

The scale of the “attacks” on August 14-18 was such that the Weibo account of
the official TV network CCTC took up the information. Many articles, idols and popular
Chinese social media accounts endorsed the initiative, calling on their members to spread
images of support.61 This wave of patriotism also included Chinese students abroad.62 The
organizers and articles dealing with this campaign asserted, while backing their claims with
screenshots, that they were able “to take control” of the comment sections of several
Facebook and Instagram pages belonging to Hong Kong media outlets or protesters.63
The Chinese also deployed their narratives through pornographic accounts on Twitter,
Facebook and YouTube. The porn audiences of these accounts were no doubt easier targets
for Beijing’s pre-fabricated narratives, but also to skirt around the growing vigilance of
traditional platforms in regard to Beijing’s activities.64 Rejected on certain platforms,
Chinese intermediaries disseminating the Chinese narrative decided to use PornHub. This
platform is not allowed in China, so Chinese agents acting from the mainland also had to
use VPNs to “cross the wall.” One such account took the name “CCYL_central,”65 which
seemed to be a reference to the Communist Youth League (→ p. 72), even if there was
probably no link between the operators and the CYL. As on the traditional platforms, protesters were compared to hooligans, or cockroaches, and the idea of democracy itself was
discredited with references to its alleged deficiencies and malfunctions.

• The accounts were differentiated according to the effect sought: spam, dormant or
relay accounts with a complementary roles in disseminating anti-protester narratives.
• The approach focused on compiling very basic content but emphasizing their volume
to saturate the spaces of the target communities and play with their emotions.
• The modus operandi was relatively artisanal because they did not have the time to
mount a targeted operation and because events in Hong Kong accelerated, but this was
largely compensated by a multi-channel and pragmatic approach that used Twitter
and Facebook just as much as WeChat or TikTok.
• They showed a real ability to adapt themselves to Twitter’ repeated decisions to
delete waves of accounts, by adopting other approaches and other relays, notably via
communities that seemed apolitical at first sight, like the fans of celebrities. The campaign led by Diba was the most sophisticated example of this in terms of its degree of
organization, its length, the aggressiveness of its members and its viral character.
• The Twittersphere and the “institutional relays” of official Chinese TV channels converged, and even aligned themselves semantically. This is another indicator of a willingness to coordinate informational operations.

SINGAPORE

Singapore has an ambivalent relationship with China, which mixes proximity and distrust, and several characteristics of the country make it both vulnerable and uniquely resilient to Chinese influence.

I. Vulnerabilities
First, there are structural weaknesses such as its size. Singapore is a city-state that can
be toured in one day with a bicycle and this affects everything: “here everything is strategic:
there is no distinction between the tactical and the strategic.”66 This concentration, combined
with the country’s hyper-connectivity, means that online fake news can reach the entire
population within minutes. Besides, the widespread use of both English and Chinese
makes the Singaporean society easy to penetrate for foreign actors. Its dependence on imports
for all essential goods and its tense relationship with Malaysia (which is itself vulnerable
to radical Islam and more or less aligned with Beijing) are other exploitable weaknesses. In
fact, Beijing can use intermediaries based in Malaysia, for instance, to conduct disinformation operations against Singapore that would seem all the more credible as Singapore
and Malaysia have a tense relationship and because a number of informational operations
have already originated from Malaysia. Furthermore, there are precedents of known Chinese
groups paid to produce content in Malaysia, to target Taiwan especially (→ p. 367).
Yet, the main vulnerability lies in the very nature of Singapore’s multiethnic, cross-community society. These attributes are both a source of great richness and a lever easily accessible to an ill-intentioned third-party actor. For now, cross-community tensions have been
avoided, but this harmony is never guaranteed and it requires proactive policies (such as the
constitutional revision that has allowed a Malaysian candidate to run for the presidency).67 A
terrorist attack could easily trigger such tensions. Indeed, among the improbable but high-impact scenarios that must not be overlooked is the possibility of a terrorist attack targeting the
Chinese, which could subsequently serve as a pretext for Beijing to intervene.
Second, there are particular vulnerabilities in regard to China, primarily the proportion of the population that is of Chinese descent: according to official statistics, 3.01 of
the 4.04 million inhabitants (74.5%) were Chinese in June 2020, 550,000 were Malaysian
66. From an interview with one of the authors, in Singapore (Nov. 2019).
67. The constitutional amendment allows a presidential election to be reserved for candidates from a particular
ethnic group if that group has not been represented in the presidency in the last five terms. This applies to all ethnic
groups: if there were a series of five non-”Chinese” presidents, the next election would be reserved for “Chinese”
candidates. See in particular Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s speech, “Race, multiracialism and Singapore’s place in
the world” (23 Sept. 2017).

(13.6%), 360,000, Indian (8.9%) and 130,000 classified as “others” (3.2%).68 This is why
Beijing’s main narrative describes Singapore as a “Chinese country” part of the
“Greater China” that owes its loyalty to China. For this precise reason, and to avoid being
assimilated into China’s orbit, Singapore has always been wary in its dealings with China.
For example, out of the five earliest ASEAN members, Singapore was the last to establish
diplomatic relations with China. However, the former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew (19591990) contributed to the rapprochement by going to China frequently and by promoting, as
early as 1979, the use of simplified characters in Singapore to align it with mainland China.
The Chinese community is very organized, in clan associations for instance, a system
dating back to the early 19th century. More than 300 associations are officially registered in
Singapore. These serve as key institutions for “preserving a sense of Chinese identity and
kinship.”69 They organize cultural events, trips to China, etc. Older generations, who generally
have a stronger affinity with China, are more likely to be members of these associations.
Immigration from China keeps the proportion of the Chinese population in Singapore
at around 75%: their exact number is classified but there are an estimated 20,000 Chinese naturalized in Singapore every year, and even more permanent residents. This flow contributes
to maintaining a Chinese majority because the community has the lowest birth rate there
(7.6 per 1000 in 2019, compared to 8.7 for Indians and 14 for Malaysians70). Chinese newcomers, who retain their networks in mainland China, are an additional vector of influence.
For younger Singaporeans, who are less interested in clan associations, Chinese influence
is channeled mostly through its economic attractiveness. The youngest, born after the
Tian’anmen generation, have a tendency to see China solely as an opportunity and not as a
threat. The two economies are highly integrated: in the last two decades, Singapore has
increased its exports to China while reducing the ones to the United States, Europe and Japan.
Hence, the most powerful vector of Chinese influence is neither clan-based nor cultural,
but economic, with professional organizations, notably the Chinese Singapore Chamber of
Commerce and the Singapore Business Federation. “The PRC exerts leverage over Singapore
businessmen by making it harder for them to get contracts, licenses, permits, loans, etc – especially in the real estate sector, where Singaporeans hold significant investments in China.”71 Those
doing business in China are in fact questioned by Chinese intelligence services, which extract
negative information that could damage the Singaporean government. They also give businessmen key elements of speech that are printed on little cards and need to be disseminated by
them.72 The Chamber of Commerce and the Business Federation have also created the Chinese
Development Assistance Council, which offers scholarships to study in China, among other
actions. The Confucius Institute of the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), inaugurated in 2005 – one of the first in the world (→ p. 300) – had only 200 students in 2006, but
7,000 in 2020.
Beijing can also count on media and individual relays. On the one hand, Xinhua has
a local office, China Daily has a supplement in the weekend edition of The Straits Times and
there are local Chinese-speaking media, such as Lianbe Zaobao, a daily newspaper created
in 1983 that has become the largest Chinese-speaking media in the city-state. On the other
hand, certain influential and notoriously pro-Chinese voices regularly intervene in the pub68. “Resident Population by Ethnic Group, Age Group and Sex Dashboard,” Department of Statistics, Singapore,

lic debate, including Kishore Mahbubani. In July 2017, as dean of the Lee Kuan Yew
School of Public Policy of the National University of Singapore, he published an op-ed in
The Straits Times calling for Singapore, “a small State” which he compares to Qatar, to be
more cautious in its relations with Beijing.73
Another, often under-estimated, vulnerability of Singapore is its approach to human
rights, since Beijing can prove a natural ally in the face of the hegemony of Western values
that are presented as universal (i.e. the debate on Asian Values).
In this context, Beijing’s objective “is to impose a Chinese identity on Singapore
so that it will align more closely with the PRC’s expanding interests.”74 In concrete terms
Beijing wants Singapore to stop training its armed forces in Taiwan (see the Terrex
Affair below), to stop speaking of the freedom of navigation, and to further develop
its trade with China. For example, Beijing wants a Chinese company to build the highspeed Singapore-Kuala Lumpur railway. Singapore refused, asking the Chinese to respond
to the call for tenders like everyone else. Beijing responded by canceling a ministerial visit.
Consequently, the main narratives conveyed in Chinese operations targeting
Singapore are the following: “Singapore is a country of Chinese culture if not altogether a
Chinese country”; “it is a small country that can’t afford to be arrogant or make an enemy out
of the Chinese juggernaut”; “It is a country that has not had a strong leadership since Lee
Kuan Yew (unlike his father, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong underestimates the importance
of the relationship with Beijing)”; “the country is too close to a declining United States, while
China represents the future (it would be in Singapore’s interest to align itself with Beijing)”;
and “Singapore shouldn’t meddle in the debate on the South China Sea.”

II. The Terrex Affair: taking pledges
Since 1975, and for lack of space at home, Singapore has trained its land army
in southern Taiwan. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with China in 1990,
Singapore has had a tacit agreement with Beijing which, while asking Singapore to use
Hainan instead of Taiwan, never turned the issue into a problem because Singapore kept
a low profile (notably by making their military wear Taiwanese uniforms when they are
there75) and respected the One-China policy.76 However, on November 23, 2016, Hong
Kong customs seized nine military Terrex armored vehicles belonging to Singapore
that were transiting in a commercial carrier to Singapore from Taiwan, where they had
taken part in military exercises. The transit was routine: Singapore has been transiting its
military vehicles, on the way back from exercises in Taiwan, through Hong Kong since the
1990s and it had never been a problem. Furthermore, this military equipment benefits from
an immunity and cannot legally be confiscated or withheld by the authorities of another
state.77 This did not prevent Beijing, via Hong Kong, from doing so.
The spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded Singapore that
states which have diplomatic relations with China must abstain from “[having] any form of

official exchanges with Taiwan, including military exchanges and cooperation.”78 Chinese
media, particularly the Global Times, took over after the ministry. They exhorted Singapore
to abandon its military training in Taiwan – unless it wanted to see its relationship with
China deteriorate. The affair generated tensions between China and Singapore until the
eventual restitution of the vehicles on January 30, 2017. In this interval, a disinformation
campaign hit Singapore using dormant accounts (inactive for a long time before they
were suddenly awakened), according to a Singaporean social media analyst.79
Truly, this was not an isolated case or a random occurrence: Hong Kong customs
officers seized the containers carrying the Terrex vehicles at a moment when Beijing was
ostensibly looking for a way to heighten the pressure on Singapore. The relationship
had been deteriorating for almost a year.80 In December 2015, a strengthened cooperation
defense agreement between the U.S. and Singapore, which notably involved the deployment of US Navy P-8A Poseidon military airplanes in Singapore, was not well-received by
Beijing. In June 2016, the absence of the Singaporean Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian
Balakrishnan at a joint ASEAN-China press conference in Kunming was also noted. In
September, the Global Times accused Singapore of having tried to raise the issue of freedom
of navigation in the South China Sea and The Hague’s verdict on the matter at a summit of
the Non-Aligned Movement in Venezuela. The attempt, according to the Party’s newspaper, was immediately blocked by many countries.81 The Singaporean ambassador to China,
Stanley Loh, protested against this “fabricated” information. Responding to the ambassador, Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times, attacked Singapore for siding with
the Philippines and Vietnam on the conflictyal South China Sea, and accused the country
of hosting U.S. warplanes “aimed at China.”82 On October 1, General Jin Yinan (金一南)
of the PLA National Defense University went further, declaring on Chinese national radio
(CNR) that Singapore had been meddling for years in affairs which are none of its concerns
(the South China Sea) and advising Washington on the subject. He believed that “[it was]
inevitable for China to strike back at Singapore, and not just on the public opinion
front… Since Singapore has gone thus far, we have got to do something, be it retaliation
or sanction.”83
The Terrex affair thus crowned a series of incidents in a tense bilateral relation.
This sequence itself was not coincidental: its climax, the Terrex affair, came exactly one
year before Singapore’s chairmanship of the ASEAN (November 2017), and coincided
with Singapore’s coordination of the ASEAN-China Dialogue (2015-2018). From
Beijing’s point of view it was necessary to remind the city-state about “who was in charge,”
particularly on the topic of freedom of navigation, and especially after Singapore had called
for the implementation of The Hague’s decision rendered in July 2016. During this period
Singaporeans were bombarded with YouTube videos in Mandarin and clan associations subjected to particularly intense pressure, always with the same narrative:
Singapore “must stay in its place” as a “Chinese country” which must not rely on
the United States; besides, the ASEAN was presented as worthless without China.84

Singapore has since scaled down its Taiwanese training exercises from 15,000 to 6,000
men (which is also explained by a downsized military service) and is planning to move them
to Australia, where training facilities should be available in 2022. The episode contributed
to the authorities’ and the public’s growing awareness of the city-state’s vulnerability to Chinese influence, or even interference. Since then, this question has been
discussed with growing frequency in public.

III. The cases of Huang Jing and Jun Wei “Dickson” Yeo
In the past few years, two cases of Chinese espionage in Singaporean academic circles
have received media attention. The first concerns Huang Jing (黄靖). Born in China in 1956,
educated in both China (masters at Fudan University) and the United States (PhD at Harvard),
he is an American citizen who lived and worked for twenty years in the United States, occupying
different positions in universities and research centers, including Stanford and the Brookings
Institution, before joining the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National
University of Singapore, serving as director for the Center on Asia and Globalization as well as
the Lee Foundation Professor on US-China Relations. In parallel, Huang was an analyst for the
Chinese press agency Xinhua. In August 2017, he was accused by the Singaporean Ministry of
the Interior of being “an agent of influence for a foreign state” that was not identified; he and
his wife were expelled from the country (with their residency permits revoked). They went to
China where, since 2019, Huang Jing has been the dean of the Institute for International and
Regional Studies at the Beijing Language and Culture University.
The second case is less ambiguous: it was tried in U.S. courts.86 It involved Jun Wei
“Dickson” Yeo (杨俊伟), born in Singapore in 1981. He may also have been linked to the
previous case as he was one of Huang’s PhD students at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public
Policy. This link led Bilahari Kausikan, an ex-diplomat and a major figure in the Singaporean
foreign policy debate, to declare that it was Huang Jing who had Yeo recruited by Chinese
intelligence services, something Huang denied.87 Yeo was recruited by Chinese intelliBeauchamp-Mustafaga, Jeffrey W. Hornung, Chinese Disinformation Efforts on Social Media, RAND Corporation, 2021, p.

that they were specifically targeted at Singaporean clan associations.

gence in 2015 through Chinese think tanks which invited and paid Yeo to write reports.
He quickly came to understand that these “scholars” were in fact intelligence officers. He
was debriefed during frequent trips to China and online via WeChat. Initially used to transmit
information about South-East Asia, he was reoriented toward the United States, where he had
previously studied, he subsequently lived in DC for several months in 2019. His mission was
to collect information and to recruit U.S. sources, which he did through LinkedIn and by
creating a fake consultancy agency that put out job offers in order to collect CVs.
In this way he came into contact with U.S. military member and officials with access to
confidential information. He would ask them to write reports in exchange for money.88 A
U.S. Army officer working at the Pentagon was hence hired to write a report, allegedly for
private Asian clients, on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and its consequences for
China. This work was paid $2,000, which was wired to the officer’s wife’s account to avoid
raising suspicion. An agent from the State Department also became entrapped by writing a
report about a member of the U.S. Cabinet. Yeo’s Chinese handlers asked him to go further
by trying to recruit the U.S. officer so that he could transmit different, more confidential,
information this time. But Yeo was arrested when he landed in the U.S. in November 2019,
precisely to do that. He pleaded guilty of espionage during his trial and was sentenced to 14
months in jail. After serving his sentence, he went back to Singapore, where he was arrested
by the Internal Security Department on the day of his arrival (December 30, 2020).89

IV. Resilience
Chinese influence is not a new problem for Singapore, which had defended itself from
it during the 1950s and 1960s “when People’s Republic of China (PRC) leaders sought to
export communist revolution to Southeast Asia.”90 Singapore has always been able to offer a
nimble resistance. Its defense rests on the development of a counter-narrative where a
unique national identity, one that is multicultural and multi-racial, “is closely managed
as an existential issue by Singapore’s ruling elites.”91 It defends the singular identity of Chinese
Singaporeans compared to other Chinese identities in the world and, of course, to the way
Beijing views this identity. For instance, to counter – or at least to compensate for – the creation in 2012 of the Chinese Cultural Center, the Singaporean government created its own
“Singapore” Chinese cultural center in 2017. It promotes the idea of “a vibrant Singapore
Chinese culture, rooted in a cohesive, multi-racial society,” and during his speech at the center’s inauguration Prime Minister Lee Hsien Long emphasized that “Chinese in Singapore are
very different from the Chinese in China, in terms of both history and identity.”92
If three quarters of the population are theoretically “Chinese,” the vast majority
of them feel Singaporean, speak English (many only speak very imperfect Mandarin),
have a largely Western, Asian and non-Chinese culture (Taiwanese and Korean singers are
far more popular in Singapore than Chinese singers). In spite of Beijing’s efforts there
is very little cultural penetration. Chinese influence on Chinese-speaking media is rela88. Michael Yong, “How a Singaporean Man Went from NUS PhD Student to Working for Chinese Intelligence in

tively limited because of the already tight control Singapore exerts on all outlets. Ultimately
money and business ties remain the main vulnerabilities.
Moreover, in recent years, people have grown cognizant to the risks posed by
Chinese influence in Singapore, in the course of several episodes: the Terrex Affair in
2016, the Huang Jing Affair in 2017, the departure the same year of Mahbubani, whose
op-ed on the “small state” generated controversy, and also the hack on the Ministry of
Health (between June 27 and July 4, 2018). 1.5 million patients’ medical files were stolen,
among which were that of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who was “specifically and
repeatedly targeted.”93 The attack was never attributed but, according to some sources, the
incident may have been a response to the Huang espionage affair to find compromising
information on the Prime Minister and blackmail him, or simply to undermine him. The
attackers found nothing however.
Meanwhile, Bilahari Kausikan, a former ambassador and permanent secretary of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published several articles in The Straits Times in June and July
2018. In these, he called on Singaporeans to “be aware” when Beijing is trying to manipulate
them and not to “trust oversimplified narratives.”94 He wrote that “China uses a range
of tactics – from legitimate diplomacy to more covert and often illegal deployment
of agents of influence and operations – to sway decision makers or public opinion
leaders.”95 He believes that these operations against Singapore were intended “not
just to direct behavior, but to condition behavior. China does not just want you to
comply with its wishes, it wants you to… do what it wants without being told.”96
He also noted that “[o]ur identity, based in the idea of multiculturalism and meritocracy,
is under pressure. There are centrifugal forces trying to pull us apart”, and went on to cite
China’s attempts to “assert the Chinese identity on multiracial Singapore.”97 These interventions inspired others afterward.98
A year later Russell Hsiao published an often-mentioned report on Chinese influence operations in Singapore.99 China reacted through its embassy, dismissing the claims
as “absurd.” But the report was benefitial as it liberated the discussion on the subject in
Singapore: the topic remains touchy but it is well-documented and, with the accumulation
of scandals since 2016, which are frequently analyzed in more and more details, the subject
has become unavoidable and easier to talk about.
Finally, the Singaporean government is acutely aware of its vulnerabilities, particularly in regard to national unity, and regularly takes measures against what a 2013 report
called “corrosive speech.”100 Unlike hate speech, it targets certain communities, and can
easily be instrumentalized, possibly by a third state, to create inter-community tensions.
For example, the Internet website TheRealSingapore.com was shut down in May 2015 by
the Media Regulation Authority (MDA) because some articles threatened public order and

national harmony. The MDA accused the website of “inciting hostile sentiment toward
foreigners in Singapore.”
In combating information manipulation, Singapore is one of the most advanced
and well-informed states in the world. Its officials travel a lot, and are willing to learn
from the experience of their foreign counterparts, in Europe, North America and Australia
in particular. The Center of Excellence for National Security (CENS) of the RSIS also
organizes an annual international symposium on these questions which has become one
of the largest meeting of that kind globally, particularly because it brings together experts
from different geographical areas (Euro-Atlantic and Asian regions). For all these reasons,
Singapore, along with Sweden, can be considered among the best prepared states
in the fight against information manipulation, and even against hybrid threats in general.

SWEDEN

Why is China interested in Sweden? Generally, China takes an interest in all Nordic
countries, that is to say Denmark (with the Faeroe Islands and Greenland), Finland,
Norway, Iceland and Sweden, to which China has been proposing for several years, in
vain for now, to meet in a “5+1” format modeled on the “17+1” group with states from
Central and Eastern Europe (→ p. 310). China considers these countries to be a double
entryway, toward the Arctic first (Sweden has hosted a Chinese satellite station in its far
northern reaches since 2006 – this is China’s first fully-owned station1), and then toward
the EU, because it has a longstanding relationship with these countries (Sweden, Denmark
and Finland, in that order, were among the first Western countries to establish diplomatic
relations with the PRC in 1950) and because they “are politically stable, pro-free trade and,
importantly, described as less suspicious toward China than many other ‘Western’ countries.’”2

They have the advantage of offering both a regulatory environment that is not
very restrictive, even permissive, for foreign investment, and leading technology
sectors, with some of the world’s most innovative companies. And this combination is
valuable. As Heather Conley and James Lewis showed, “China remains dependent on
the West for advanced technology, and it uses four techniques to acquire it: (1)
forced technology transfers as a prerequisite to conducting business in China; (2)
placement of students and workers in universities and companies in the West; (3)

cyber espionage; and (4) the acquisition of foreign firms.”4 In Nordic countries
China mostly uses economic espionage, as it does elsewhere – except in local universities
(China lacks the critical number of Chinese students it has in Australia or Canada for
example), but also the acquisition of local businesses, as a privileged way of accessing
technologies.
If “the primary motive for Chinese investment in the Nordics is commercial,”
strategic interests are never far behind: it can be illustrated by investments in “semiconductors and munitions-related technology as well as emerging technology such
as FinTech, GreenTech, BioTech and MaritimeTech.”5 The acquisitions of Awilco in
Norway (2008), which produces drilling equipment among other things, of Volvo Cars
in Sweden (2010) and of Elkem, dealing with the production of silicon, silicone and
carbon materials, in Norway (2011). They still rank among China’s most important
purchases in Europe.
In this region, Sweden has generated the greatest Chinese interest because it is particularly innovative and has a strong start-up culture. “Sweden is China’s Nordic Hub6”
and it attracted the highest levels of Chinese investment in Europe ($3.6 billion) in 2018,
far ahead of other countries ($1.6 billion in the United Kingdom, 1.5 in Germany and 1.4
in France).7 When the Chinese Geely purchased Volvo Cars in 2010 and Volvo AB (which
makes trucks and buses) in 2018 – one of the most important Chinese acquisitions in
Europe and North America – it made an impression in Sweden and internationally. A peak
in acquisitions was reached in 2017 (51 majority and 40 minority holdings). In 2018,
China had a majority stake in 114 companies.8 And, in November 2019, more than 1,000
companies declared that they were, in effect, owned by a Chinese or Hong Kong citizen –
and yet, the real scope of these acquisitions is certainly greater than what can actually be
measured.9
Beijing has taken a notable interest in firms that develop dual-use technologies,
i.e. for both civilian and military uses. For instance, Chinese companies have purchased
three Swedish semiconductor businesses, including Silex Microsystems (by a company with
ties to the Chinese defense sector), and Chematur, a spin-off of the ammunition manufacturer Nobel which stands at “the center of Sweden’s defense industrial base”10 (by the
Wanhua group). The government’s China strategy, presented in September 2019, confirms
that CCP intelligence activities in Sweden are not only significant but also focused
on acquiring military technologies, in addition to intelligence on Swedish military capabilities. It also mentioned that the Chinese satellite station in northern Sweden could also
be used for military intelligence.11

I. A typical case of a “Machiavellian moment”
For a long time, China invested a good deal in its relationship with Sweden and the
Swedish public opinion was rather favorable, since China meant new jobs. But then the
Party entered in a “Machiavellian moment” with the appointment of a new ambassador in August 2017: Gui Congyou (桂从友), apparently tasked with dominating the
public debate. He quickly showed himself to be aggressive (some observors acknowledged
a turning point in early 2018), attacking the media, journalists, the government, political
parties, scholars, and denying visas with the aim of enticing fear and self-censorship.
The ambassador’s profile is revealing: Gui Gonyou admitted that he did not know anything about Sweden when he was appointed, that he had never visited the country, and that
he had never had a Swedish friend.12 He even declared in February 2020 that “he did not
know why he had been sent to Sweden.”13 However, he speaks very good Russian and he
is an expert on Russia: the earlier part of his career alternated between Moscow, where he
was posted twice and he remained for about 10 years, and Beijing, where he kept a close eye
on Russian affairs for the ministry, often accompanying Xi Jinping during his diplomatic
visits to countries in the former USSR. He was one of the main instigators of the Xi-Putin
summits and he attended at all high-level meetings between Chinese and Russian leaders.
In Stockholm, the ambassador multiplied attacks and threatening statements,
especially against the media. He even talked of “the tyranny of the media.”14 On television he likened Swedish media criticizing China to a “48-kilogram lightweight boxer who
starts a fight with an 86-kilogram heavyweight boxer, who out of kindness and goodwill urges the (smaller) boxer to take care of himself.” This provoked a reaction from
the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, who interpreted the ambassador’s words as an
“unacceptable threat” and an attempt to intimidate, and incidentally to muzzle, the press.15
The embassy also publishes a lot on its own site: during 2019, it published at least 74 negative comments on Swedish media, most of them in reaction to publications perceived to
express criticism of China.16 Gui Congyou maintains constant pressure on the media,
inviting some journalists to lunch to comment on how they cover China, sending protest
emails himself when he doesn’t like an article.
These practices were documented and analyzed by journalist Patrik Oksanen, head
of the Center for Influence and Disinformation Analysis at the think tank Frivärld, in a
September 2020 study titled China’s attacks to silence critics.17 When conducted a follow-up
analysis a year later, he found that the embassy’s tactics had changed. In an August 2021
report entitled The Dragon’s Changing Tactics, he noted that the frequency of public statements
on the embassy’s website appeared to have decreased, with the emphasis shifting to direct,
intimidating and even threatening letters to journalists, experts and MPs.18 Already,
in a survey made public in January 2020, at least four of Sweden’s largest media groups
(Svenska Dagbladet, Expressen, Sveriges Radio and Sveriges Television) said they had been

contacted and criticized repeatedly by the Chinese embassy – some of the language used,
in letters and emails, was threatening.19 And, in April 2021, Jojje Olsson, a Swedish journalist based in Taiwan who has long been a target of the Chinese authorities, received yet
another email from the Chinese embassy, clearly threatening him: “we ask you to stop your
wrongful actions immediately, otherwise you will end up facing the consequences of your
actions.”20 In order to denounce and counter this practice, the think tank Frivärld launched
a campaign on social networks, calling on the recipients of these messages to testify using
the hashtag #Kinabrev.
This behavior is not exclusive to the embassy: Swedish journalists we met said that
they were victims of intimidation tactics from Chinese diplomats but also from various
Chinese associations, including student associations, which demanded that the journalists
stop writing about specific topics. Some journalists were even followed by car to their
homes.21
This pressure goes far beyond the media: for instance, the embassy convinced the
Sheraton Stockholm hotel to cancel the celebration of the Taiwanese national holiday in
October 2019, even though it had hosted the event for more than a decade. The celebration
was finally hosted by the Swedish History Museum, which resisted the embassy’s pressure.22
China’s aggressive turn in Sweden has been consequential since 2018: the SinoSwedish relationship has considerably deteriorated. The Chinese ambassador has been
summoned by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs nearly forty times since he was
appointed. In late 2019, several MPs demanded his expulsion. Then again in 2021 after
the journalist Jojje Olsson was threatened by the Chinese embassy: several Swedish politicians then again called for the expulsion of the ambassador.23 Sweden was also the
first European country to close all its Confucius Institutes (the last in December 2019
and the last Classroom in April 2020).24 Sweden eventually rewrote its “China strategy,”
which was presented to the national parliament in September 2019, and it created a center for China Studies (along with another privately-funded institution) to better anticipate
challenges posed by China’s growing influence. Even the city of Gothenburg, the second
largest in the country, home to Volvo, and where China is omnipresent (to the extent that
restaurant and service personnel are trained to speak Chinese), has cancelled its twin
city program with Shanghai in April 2020 – a 34-year-old partnership. In October 2020,
the Swedish Post and Telecommunications Authority (PTS) banned equipment from
Chinese companies (Huawei, ZTE) in its ongoing call for tenders on the 5G infrastructure (a decision confirmed in January 2021 by the Administrative Court in Stockholm,
which rejected Huawei’s appeal). The government is increasingly distrustful of China, once
seen only as an economic boon, but now perceived as a national security threat. China’s
public approval plummeted with 49% of unfavorable opinion in 2017, 52% in 2018, 70%
in 2019, 85% in 2020, and 80% in 2021. Nowadays, out of the 34 countries surveyed, only
the Japanese hold more negative opinions on China than the Swedes (→ p. 191).25 From
a regional perspective, far from being tempted by the Chinese proposition of a “5+1” for19. “China’s large-scale media push.”

mat, the Nordics are considering organizing themselves against Chinese influence in a “5
against 1” format.
In September 2021, the Chinese embassy in Stockholm finally announced the departure
of Ambassador Gui Congyou, who was recalled to Beijing. This announcement was welcomed in Sweden with a certain relief (expressed on social networks by journalists, researchers and political leaders26), but without naivety as to his successor who could follow in his
footsteps if Beijing wishes. His record is objectively disastrous. Since the end of 2017, he
has unpicked the relationship his predecessors had built. “By launching a combative campaign
ill-adapted to local conditions, China appears to have shot itself in the foot.”27 How can it
be explained? First, as Jerdén and Bohman showed, his priority was not to seduce the
Swedes but the CCP: “[his] actions may [have been] motivated by a desire to impress superiors in Beijing. By vocally propagating China’s narrative abroad, he [put] his embassy in the
spotlight and positioned it as a front runner in Xi Jinping’s mission to increase China’s global
influence over media and ‘tell China’s story well.’”28 This is an overall feature of the phenomenon of “wolf warrior” diplomats – which we presented in the third part (→ p. 222). Gui
Gonyou was one of its precursors. Then, the ambassador’s lack of understanding of liberal democracies – his experience abroad being exclusively Russian – very likely contributed
to his haphazardeous crisis management and in underestimating the negative consequences
of an overly aggressive behavior in Sweden for China. The embassy should have foreseen that
Sweden, being one of the most hostile countries toward the CCP and toward authoritarianism
in general, was also likely to resist this pressure.
Beyond the personality of the ambassador, Sweden is debating whether the country
was chosen as a testing ground for a more aggressive strategy that China could ultimately generalize globally. Why Sweden? There are several reasons:
• Sweden is the right size: small enough not to be a threat, with no diaspora-related
issues (there were only 31,700 people of Chinese origin in Sweden in 2017, 10,000 more
than in 2009, and 2,671 students),29 but large enough to be significant, in any case for
Europe.
• Sweden is a world champion of democratic and liberal values, one of the leaders
in terms of “soft power diplomacy.”30 The country always tops rankings (thus the cultural shock experienced by the Chinese ambassador when he arrived in a country systematically in the top five of RSF’s Freedom of the Press rankings, whereas China is in
the bottom five or three out of 180 countries). Sweden is then a symbol, a model to
be broken (with the idea that if China achieves this, the foundations of all democracies
can be shaken at their core).
• Linked to this, this is also a state that is among the most vehement critics of human
rights violations in China. From this point of view, going after Sweden was an opportunity to demonstrate that criticizing China comes at a cost. This is a message for the
world and especially for Europeans.

• Sweden is one of China’s main rivals in certain key industrial sectors, including
5G infrastructures, batteries and trucks.
• There were already several irritating issues in their bilateral relations: the most
infamous being the Gui Minhai (桂敏海) affair, involving a Swedish citizen detained in
China since 2015 (see box below). But also Peter Dhalin, a Swedish human rights activist, who was kidnapped and incarcerated for 23 days in China in 2016, and was forced
to confess on television.31 The “hostage diplomacy” practiced by China has left traces
in Sweden. There was also the Qiao Jianjun (乔建军) affair, which involved a former
civil servant who became one of China’s most wanted fugitives, allegedly for corruption
(he was accused of misappropriating millions of dollars). He was arrested in Sweden at
Beijing’s request in August 2018, but Stockholm refused to extradite him (the Swedish
Supreme Court held that this would be a violation of the European Convention on
Human Rights, since he would risk death, torture and/or other inhuman or degrading
treatment). He was freed in June 2019 and re-arrested five days later at the request of the
United States, which was also looking for Qiao. He was extradited to the United States
in late May 2020.
• Finally, Sweden – which hosted the Dalai Lama in September 2018 – has granted asylum to Uyghur, Tibetan and Falun Gong refugees, i.e. Beijing’s main targets. This
was confirmed by a series of spying cases in these communities: in 2010, a Uyghur
refugee was condemned to 16 months in prison on charges of spying for China (he had
infiltrated the Uyghur World Congress and provided information to a Chinese intelligence officer posing as a diplomat)32; in 2018 a Tibetan refugee was also condemned to
22 months in jail on charges of espionage in the service of China (he had infiltrated the
Swedish Tibetan community and was transmitting information to a Chinese intelligence
officer in Poland).33
For Beijing the objective is to make Sweden submit by limiting its freedom of expression, notably on the “five poisons” while sending a warning shot at other countries,
especially in Europe. But this has completely failed: instead of giving in, Sweden has
resisted and the consequence has simply been the deterioration of bilateral relations and of
China’s image in Sweden.
In any case, the Swedish case is both an opportunistic test and a symptom of a
worldwide evolution in the behavior of China: the same happened in Canada (→ p. 537),
Australia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Among them, there are differences of intensity but not of nature. The Swedish case is particularly spectacular because of preexisting
tensions in the bilateral relations, but this announces a larger turning point and was interpreted as such, even in 2018.34 We call this turning point the Chinese “Machiavellian
moment” (→ p. 619).

The Gui Minhai Affair
Gui Minhai is a writer, editor and librarian who, born in China, arrived in Sweden in 1988 to
begin a Ph.D and who stayed there, acquiring the Swedish citizenship while renouncing his
Chinese citizenship. He then settled in Hong Kong, creating several publishing houses from
2006 on. Under a pseudonym (Ah Hai), he published a number of works on China’s political
life that were banned in mainland China. Knowing himself to be watched and under threat, he
avoided going back to China, missing his father’s last days of life and funeral as a result.
In October 2015, he was abducted by Chinese intelligence officers during his holiday in Thailand and disappeared. Four of his colleagues also subsequently disappeared.
Confirmation of his incarceration came in January 2016 in a quintessential Soviet-style
televised confession – a practice that has made a comeback in China in recent years35
(in July 2020, Britain’s Ofcom estimated that CGTN had violated the broadcasting rules of the
United Kingdom by showing the forced confession of a British citizen).36 In a CCTV broadcast, Gui, in tears, “confessed” to having killed a young woman in a car accident in 2003 and
explained that, full of remorse, he had surrendered to the Chinese authorities. He added: “I do
not want any individual or organization, including Sweden, to involve themselves in, or interfere with, my return to China. Although I have Swedish citizenship, I truly feel that I am still
Chinese – my roots are in China. So I hope Sweden can respect my personal choice, respect
my rights and the privacy of my personal choice.”37
In October 2017, Chinese authorities informed Sweden of Gui Minhai’s release. He, however,
had not provided any news, which left the exact situation unclear. What we do know is that
in January 2018, while in the company of two Swedish diplomats on a train headed for
Beijing for medical examinations, Gui was once again abducted by ten men dressed as
civilians. He reappeared in another televised confession, in which he admitted to having been
pressured by the Swedish authorities into trying to leave China, using a medical appointment
at the Swedish embassy as a pretext.
In November 2019, he received the Tucholsky Prize for Freedom of Expression from the
Swedish section of PEN, which angered the Chinese embassy. In February 2020 he was finally
sentenced to ten years in prison on charges of espionage – a new accusation that came
as a surprise as it had never been raised before. On this occasion, it was revealed that in 2018
Gui Minhai had “demanded” to recover his Chinese citizenship (which was largely seen as a
maneuver to deprive him of his consular visitation rights). However, Sweden still considers
Gui as one of its citizens since, as far as Sweden is concerned, there has been no proper and
formal renunciation of Swedish citizenship.

II. The case of the Chinese tourists and the reactions to satire
(2018)
This affair took place in September 2018, in two stages. First some Chinese tourists claimed
they had been abused by the Swedish police, the embassy became involved and the affair was
largely covered by Chinese media. Second, a Swedish satirical program mentioned the events
and its take on them generated a violent reaction. Before examining these two phases in detail,
we should note that the timing of the affair was suspicious, because very opportune, coming
at a moment when the Chinese embassy in Sweden was on the defensive.

A. Prologue
This affair took place in a context of tensions that had been escalating after early June
2018, following the simultaneous publication, in 38 Swedish newspapers, of a call for the release
of Gui Minhai signed by 45 intellectuals and public figures.38 The embassy immediately reacted
by sending emails, letters and texts, and by calling the signatories; more than two thirds of them
confirmed that they received a lengthy file from Chinese authorities incriminating Gui Minhai. Jojje
Olsson and other Swedish journalists subsequently demonstrated that these files were fabricated.39
The very aggressive embassy multiplied its often ad hominem attacks against the signatories and
the media which published the call to release Gui Minhai. This offensive was counter-productive
insofar as it drew negative attention and “raised interest and awareness not only about the Gui
Minhai case, but Chinese influence on Swedish society in general.”40 In late June protests took
place in front of the embassy. In late August, Gui Minhai was formally invited to the Gothenburg
Book Fair: the invitation was published in the press and sent to the Chinese embassy.
Björn Jerdén and Viking Bohmans’ quantitative study, which counted the number of critical statements released by the Chinese embassy,41 confirmed their marked increase since
early June 2018. The authors also showed that most of the embassy’s statements pertained
either to Gui Minhai or to human rights in China (notably Xinjiang or organ trafficking).

This timeline shows that the affair that occurred in September 2018, which we present in the following pages, occurred precisely when the embassy was on the back
foot and it constituted a riposte to criticism of human rights violations in China. In other
words, it allowed Chinese authorities to create a diversion and turn the accusation
around in a piece of hypocritical sophistry (tu quoque) that let Beijing attack Sweden
for violating the rights of Chinese tourists on its own soil. This coincidence corroborates
our hypothesis that this affair was, at the very least, a blatant instance of Chinese
instrumentalization of an incident, and it may even have been an entirely fabricated
incident designed to manipulate public opinion.

B. Chinese tourists allegedly abused by the Swedish police
On September 1, shortly before midnight, the Zengs (曾), a family of three, arrived at
the Generator Hostel in Stockholm nearly fifteen hours in advance, their reservation having
been booked for the afternoon of the following day. They demanded to sleep in the hall
which the hotel refused.42 The family settled down on the sofas and refused to leave.
Hours later, judging their behavior as threatening,
the staff called the police, which removed the family.
Whereupon a theatrical scene ensued, with several
cameras rolling: the father, suddenly unable to walk
had to be carried out of the hotel by the police while
the son screamed in English: “This is killing! This is
killing!” The mother, seated on the ground, began
crying and screaming in Chinese: “Save our lives.”
To add to this comedy, without anyone having touched him, the son hurled himself on the
ground crying, as if he had been pushed.43
Three videos were apparently shot by the son and a fourth by a bystander, who later gave
an interview in which he said that the police was in no way violent. According to the son, in

parents were old and in poor health. The son then left claiming to go in search of a room in another hotel, but returned
accompanied by a woman. The hotel refused to let them all sleep in the hall and asked that they leave the premises.
When they refused the establishment called the police (https://m.rrrtttyyy.com/news/148118.html).

comments published two weeks later by the CCP’s daily newspaper Global Times, the police
allegedly forced the family into a vehicle.
They were then driven around for an hour while the parents were
allegedly beaten and, finally, all were thrown into a cemetery out
of town, surrounded by woods and exposed to the cold. Actually,
there was no indication that the family suffered any physical
violence; they were dropped off by the police not in a cemetery
but at a metro station bearing the name Skogskyrkogarden
(“wooded cemetery”), a reference to a site on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The station
was located not outside but inside the city, less than six kilometers and a 10-minute metro ride
away from the hotel. This was standard procedure and in conformity with the law, according
to the prosecutor in charge of the case, who could not find anything to reproach to the police.
One of the videos and several photos were released by the anonymous Twitter account @
Swedenpoliceto1 (Swedenpolicetorturechineseelders), which only ever posted on the day of the
event, September 2, 2018. It posted 58 tweets in four hours (between 8:33 am and 12:43 pm), from
an iPhone,44 to attract attention to the incident and stoke up indignation; it has never been used since.

According to the ambassador, the embassy was alerted by the family on September 2 at 6am
and received a detailed written report, along with photos, on the morning of September 5.45 The
family reportedly left the country on September 2, with this comment: “I could not imagine
this happening in any modern country, especially Sweden, the homeland of the Nobel Prize. It
is so ironic that they talk about human rights all the time.”46 The Chinese embassy waited two

weeks before publicly reacting on its internet website. On September 14, it released a warning in
Chinese to all nationals visiting the country and informing them that Chinese people in Sweden
had recently been “harshly treated by the Swedish authorities.”47 The next day, the embassy
posted a message of indignation “strongly condemning the behavior of the Swedish police,”
announcing that official protests had been sent to the Swedish government in Stockholm and
its embassy in Beijing, and demanding a public apology, that the police officers involved be punished, and for a financial comensation for the family of tourists.48 Two days later, the embassy
posted an interview in English and Chinese.49 In it the ambassador repeated the family’s version
of events, according to which they had arrived only “a few hours” early (in reality, fifteen hours
early), been “treated brutally” (there is no proof of this and even a testimony to the contrary),
and thrown “into a cemetery” (this was in fact the name of a subway station), etc. Most notably,
he used the incident to address the larger security situation in Sweden and how he, before
arriving, had thought of Sweden as a safe place where it wasn’t even necessary to lock one’s
door, and how one year in the country had destroyed this illusion. He finally stated that, on average, two Chinese tourists in Sweden had their wallets or passports stolen every day, highlighting
that the embassy had issued no fewer than three warnings to Chinese nationals in the last month.
On September 23, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in turn published a warning
on Sweden but without specifically mentioning the Zeng incident. The statement focused on
the allegedly rising number of cases of theft and aggression suffered by Chinese tourists.50
This seemingly confirmed that the Chinese authorities’ communication strategy
was reaching beyond the Zeng affair and using it to develop a thorough narrative
about the Swedish society (which in this case was portrayed as dangerous).
On September 15, in parallel to the embassies’ statement, the Global
Times devoted an article to the affair using pictures posted 13 days
earlier on Twitter by @Swedenpoliceto1 and described in the article
as having been “provided by Zeng”; in the article, Zeng was introduced as the son of the victimized family.51 This corroborates the
idea that the account was Zeng’s doing. However, the Chinese version of the article (on Huanqiu.com) used a supplementary photo
not featured in the English version and which had not been posted
by @Swedenpoliceto1. It allegedly showed the father’s back with the
following caption: “Zeng father’s bruises after the attack (the marks
of blood congestion – i.e. bruising – have not disappeared even three days later).”52
For days, the pictures and the affair were widely covered by Chinese media, after
the Global Times (CGTN, Caixin, news.cina.cn, sohu.com, french.china.org.cn, etc.), and
on Weibo where the hashtag #ChineseTouristsMistreatedByTheSwedishPolice (#中
国游客遭瑞典警察粗暴对待) was used 100 million times.53 Chinese-speaking Weibo

users also hypothetized about the identity of the son, Zeng Yi. The most popular thesis was that Zeng Yi was the general manager (总经理) of the pharmaceutical company
Tasly in Nigeria (天士力尼日利亚分公司), and the creator of the Twitter account @
Swedenpoliceto1.54 The testimony of a former colleague described someone who used to
travel so often that it had become suspicious; he had previously told a story about how his
parents made a scene at an airport to take advantage of a situation.
However, the prevailing interpretation that the @Swedenpoliceto1 Twitter account is that of
the son Zeng is questionable. While this account only ever posted on the day of the event, about
50 tweets related to the event, it was created earlier and liked about 15 messages between August
25 and September 2, mainly about Swedish nationalists, published by Russian media including
RT and Ruptly – a behavior that seems to have no connection with the supposed interests of
a Chinese tourist. These two very distinct lives of the @Swedenpoliceto1 account could lend
credence to the idea that it is a mercenary account, used first to amplify, albeit briefly, Russian
media and Swedish far-right themes, and then for a single Chinese operation. This means that,
if the operator of the account in its second period was indeed the son Zeng, he was not an ordinary tourist; and this supports the hypothesis of a manipulation.
Whether the hotel scene was built from scratch or an incident that involved more
or less unstable individuals, the embassy took advantage of the opportune timing
of the affair. Not only did it allow them to turn accusations of human rights violations against critics of the country, while the Gui Minhai affair was in full swing,
but it occurred a couple of days before Sweden’s legislative elections on September
9, 2018. Two days after the elections, the Chinese embassy released a statement vigorously
contradicting “rumors” accusing China of meddling with the election,55 which came as a
surprise since no one had made such an accusation. The events also preceded the visit
of the Dalai Lama to Sweden (he arrived in Malmö on September 11).
Besides, the embassy apparently tried to use Chinese tourists as leverage, as it
had previously done elsewhere in the world (→ p. 405). In December 2018 the ambassador explained that the September incident had “damaged the image of Sweden in China,
hurting tourism cooperation between China and Sweden. Now, the number of Chinese
tourists in Sweden has dropped sharply. We hope the Swedish side will take effective
measures to repair Sweden’s image in China. We once again urge Swedish police to sincerely apologize to the three Chinese tourists and restore Chinese tourists’ confidence
in Sweden.”56 The message was clear: if Stockholm wanted to see Chinese tourists
return (along with their purchasing power), the Swedish police had to apologize.

C. The reactions to satire
The satirical TV show Svenska Nyheter (Swedish News), broadcast on SVT1, covered
the Chinese tourists’ affair weeks later, on September 22, in a ten-minute passage dedicated to
Swedish anti-Chinese bias. The intention was laudable: as they saw it, the program makers were
not mocking the Chinese but rather the Swedish and their oftenracist prejudices as well as, on
occasion, their “complete lack of knowledge about China,” as the presenter Jesper Rönndahl
54. Originally written by users @本無思維 and @锖铨 and relayed by Sansanjiang (三三酱) for instance, (https///
weibo/ttarticle/p/show?id=23096342861300710271017), before being taken up by several outlets.

said. However, toward the end of the program, they took it a step further: the presenter introduced a short satirical film addressed to the Chinese “so that they feel welcome” in Sweden;
the film was also translated into Mandarin and posted on Youku, the Chinese “YouTube.”
This one-minute-and-twenty-second clip offered “a few tips to avoid cultural shock,” such as
not defecating outside historical buildings (a reference to the fact that outside the Louvre, a
Mandarin-only sign asks visitors not to defecate on the floor),57 to not consider dogs as food, to
eat with cutlery, etc. On several occasions, an icon showed a Chinese silhouette clearly recognizable by its pointed peasant hat and bowl with chopsticks. Even if it was meant to denounce
Swedish racism toward the Chinese, the program used images that were particularly
insulting to theem: this subtle irony was evidently missed by Chinese authorities.
The show’s producer, whom we met, recognized with hindsight that the program was
“offensive and stupid.”58 He especially regretted having failed to anticipate the Chinese
reaction. Thomas Hall, who manages SVT1’s programs, publicly recognized that it was a
mistake to have uploaded the film on Youku.59
The clip was quickly removed from Youku but it did remain online for several days.
The embassy protested in a communiqué, demanding an apology; a formal complaint was
lodged with the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But this was not all: in the wake
of the official response came a veritable counter-attack, mounted in a matter of
days. SVT1 suffered numerous cyberattacks (DDoSes). The show’s Instagram and
Facebook accounts, the channel’s and the host’s, were attacked by trolls who saturated them by posting thousands of hateful messages in Chinese, English and (poor)
Swedish. The number was so high that the accounts had to be temporarily suspended.
Furthermore, it took only a couple of hours to the Chinese “patriotic
rapper” Li Yijie (aka “Pissy”), leader of CD Rev (close to the CYL), and
already discussed in part two (→ p. 75), to knock out a song about the
affair that was posted on YouTube on September 23, the day after the
program was broadcast. It was an impressive but not unusually quick
response for the band.60 The song opened on the Zeng affair:
First things first/ Couple days ago / the Chinese family arrived at a hostel / in Stockholm / Your capital city / About
2 a.m. / they got nowhere to go / They just wanna stay in the lobby / Cuz the reservation was for the next night /
tired and anxious prolly / They were like down and down in a valley, in panic / Then the police removed them from it
/ What da heck was going on with this? / Is it culture difference? / you just do not give a shieeeet.

All of this led to the proverbial “pot calling the kettle black” with a verse on the hypocrisy of liberal democracies who ignore their own principles (QED):
Western nations / Sweetie Sweden / always talk about human rights / pay attention / How could you be so rude without
a reason? […]/ different races / different standards / Western nations always on the rank list / Democracy hypocrisy.

After a “You ‘bout to feel the power of Chinese nation,” and “you are just like virus,” came
the threat of economic sanctions, boycotts of Swedish brands and embargos on tourism:

We got a lota free choice / EF that’s a good idea / Ericsson, Terra Pak / And IKEA / We can choose to refuse the
Swedish brands / And never on a trip to your Sweden again.

And, as a finishing touch, a passage on territorial integrity:
Yeah Last but not the least / Here I wanna say / You know what / The map of China on your TV Show / You should
just, you know / fix it / You know what / Tibet and Taiwan belong to China, bitch / You better watch out next time.

In addition to this online propaganda, human excrement was mailed to the TV
station, as well as to the home addresses of the show’s host and of the actress who starred
in the clip. One of the station’s executives said he feared for his physical safety after seeing
people watching over his home in the morning and evening.
In an attempt to calm things down, the channel organized a meeting in its offices between
the producer of the program, several of the channel’s executives and three representatives
of various Chinese organizations in Sweden, who demanded a public apology and that the
video be withdrawn. For them the most insulting element of the caricature seems to have
been the peasant hat, a symbol of China’s under-development. They obliged the producer
to make his apology on video – in what he felt was a “forced confession.” As he regretted
recording the video almost immediately, he asked them not to release it, explaining that
this would make it more difficult to obtain a public apology.61 The video was published on
Chinese media in Chinese, but not in Sweden, and thus did not receive international attention.
In the following week’s show, on September 30, 2018, the show’s host decided to
respond with humor to the hate campaign he was subjected to, explaining that he received
“tens of thousands of reactions, and by reactions I mean images of me eating feces.” He
also broadcast a part of the rapper Pissy’s song. Taking a more serious tone, he apologized
for the clip that aired at the end of the earlier program and that was uploaded on Youku,
acknowledging that he had gone too far: “[to] all the people in China and in Sweden –
not the government – who were offended by this film, this was not our intention, and we
should have anticipated that our clip would be perceived as racist. This was irresponsible
and culturally insensitive on our part. We are sorry. However, this is not an apology
addressed to the Chinese regime, which does not respect liberty of expression.”
He then criticized China, with very sensible mentions of the Chinese strategy in Sweden,
its aggressive diplomacy, pressure against the media, etc. He also spoke about Gui Minhai’s
abduction and detention, as well as the rapper Pissy, adding that “if he [gave] the impression of rapping the Chinese government’s press releases,” it was because he worked for
the government, which financed his rap band CD Rev. This was precisely the case, as we
saw (→ p. 75).
Finally, on October 3, five Chinese associations of the diaspora in Sweden co-signed an
open letter, in Swedish and in Chinese, denouncing the program.62

III. The Anna Lindstedt affair
This affair, which was described as “the biggest Swedish diplomatic scandal in
modern times,”63 started when Anna Lindstedt, the Swedish ambassador to China,
invited the daughter of Gui Minhai (→ p. 527), Angela Gui – with whom she had been
in regular contact – to Stockholm. Angela had been fighting relentlessly for her father’s
release. The ambassador asked her to travel to Stockholm on January 24, 2019, to try a
“new approach” and meet with businessmen who could help her. To reassure Angela, she
said that these were people she “trusted” and that she would be present at the meeting.
When Angela arrived at the rendezvous, a hotel in central Stockholm, she was joined by the
ambassador and two Chinese businessmen, who invited her into their car and took her
to another hotel, to a lounge accessible only with a member’s card. She stayed for two
days, during which she was questioned about her personal life and her studies (she was a
PhD student at Cambridge). She was constantly watched over and followed, even when she
went to the bathroom. The two men invited many of their colleagues: “[t]here was a lot of
wine, a lot of people, and a lot of increasingly strange questions. But because Ambassador
Lindstedt was present and seemingly supportive of whatever it was that was going on,
[Angela] kept assuming that this had been initiated by the Swedish Foreign Ministry.”
One of the two men told her she had “potential” and proposed that she came with
them to work in China. He could arrange for a visa with the embassy in Stockholm and
showed a photo of himself and his associate with Ambassador Gui Congyou. She refused the
offer. The following day, the same man told her that he had “connections within the CCP”
and assured her that her father could soon be released if she said nothing about the
matter: “I was told I needed to be quiet. I wasn’t to tell anyone about this, or say anything
publicly about the case. I was also to stop all media engagement with it. Ambassador Lindstedt,
who was sat next to me, agreed to the plan. She said that if my father was released, she’d go
on Swedish television and speak of the bright future of Sweden-China relations, as well as
express regret over the Chinese tourist hotel incident in Stockholm [of September 2018],
and the subsequent coverage of it on a Swedish comedy show [the case of Svenska Nyheter
presented previously].” The man raised his voice menacingly – “you have to trust me, or
you will never see your father again” – and asked her: “what is most important to you? Your
values or your father?” He added that, if she kept speaking to the media, she would damage
“Anna’s” career. The ambassador agreed, saying that China was “adopting a new diplomatic
line,” where all forms of broadcast activism would force China to “punish Sweden.” Angela
finally managed to extricate herself from this uncomfortable situation and left Stockholm.
The following week she called the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was told by
staff that “they had not had the slightest idea this whole affair was taking place. They had
not even been informed the ambassador was in the country.” Two weeks after the incident,
Angela told the story in an online article, which she ended by stating: “I’m not going to be
quiet in exchange for a visa and an arbitrary promise that my father ‘might’ be released.
Threats, verbal abuse, bribes, or flattery won’t change that.”64
This is how the affair started. Anna Lindstedt was immediately removed from office
and recalled to Stockholm, where she was accused of “arbitrariness in negotiations with a

foreign power” relying on “a law that was crafted for times of war” which “had not been used
since 1794.”65
The investigations later revealed that one of the two businessmen was Kevin Liu. Liu
should not have been able to enter Sweden since he was blacklisted in 2011. He had since
tried to enter the Schengen space using “different identities and forged passports,”66 but had
until then been detected and turned away. This time he had visibly succeeded in obtaining a
visa through the Finnish general consulate in Hong Kong. The court was unable to establish
that the two businessmen represented the interests of a foreign state, China, and this is
one of the reasons Anna Lindstedt was exonerated in July 2020. Experts on China know
that the relative success of this grey zone operation – because plausible deniability was
maintained, the operation was not state-backed according to the courts – has probably
been interpreted by Beijing as an invitation to persist with its efforts.

The different Chinese diaspora groups in Sweden, somewhat affiliated to the United
Front network, are “hometown associations (同乡会, tongxiang hui): the Stockholm Overseas
Chinese Service Center (斯德哥尔摩华助中心, Sidege’ermo Hua Zhu Zhongxin), which was
founded in 2017 with an authorization from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, a united
front organ; local branches of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association; professional
organizations; media outlets and other networks.”67 The most important actor, the “central node,” in this “Swedish United Front community” might be the Swedish China
Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification (瑞典中国和平统一
促进会), created in 2005, which is the Swedish branch of the eponymous organization that
acts around the world to promote the “annexation of Taiwan.”68 There is also the National
Swedish Chinese Association that the ambassador Gui described as the “backbone” of
the Swedish branch of the Council for Reunification, and which received 812,000 Swedish
crowns (€77,500) of public subsidies in Sweden between 2012 and 2017.69
There are myriad associations (five of which, for example, co-signed the open letter
attacking the satirical program),70 but they are often headed by the same people: for example, according to Pär Nyrén, the president of the Association for Reunification, Ye Pei-qun
(Sometimes spelled Ye Peiquan in Sweden 叶沛群), is also the president of a Chinese language school in Stockholm, of the Committee of the Nordic Zhigong Association (北欧致
公协会) and of the Swedish Chinese National Association (瑞典华人总会) – whereas his
uncle, Ye Kexiong (叶克雄), heads the Swedish Qingtian Association. Another example is
Zong Jinbo (宗金波), a PLA veteran, who is an honorary president of the Association for
Reunification, and president of the Swedish Tianjin Association.71
Among other prominent local relays of Beijing are the Sweden-China Bridge association (directed by Xueifei Chen Axelsson, who writes for the news website Greenpost.

Executive Group for Sweden (BRIX), which the ambassador Gui referred to as his
“Swedish friends”72 and whose objective is to promote the BRI in Sweden. It was revealed
in 2019 that one of its executives, Lydia Liu (刘芳), also president of the Swedish Hubei
and Hunan Association (瑞典两湖同乡会) and a member of the municipal council of
Nacka in Stockholm’s suburbs, had close links to the UFWD. As a consequence, she was
expelled from the Christian-Democrat party.73 BRIX founding members come principally from the Swedish branch of the Schiller Institute. The president of BRIX,
Ulf Sandmark, is also the president of the Swedish section of the Schiller Institute. Based
in Germany with members from around 50 countries, the institute is one of the main
organs of the LaRouche movement, named after the U.S. politician Lyndon Larouche: an
international political network regularly condemned as neo-fascist, anti-Semitic and conspiratorial (→ p. 326). The small European Workers Party is a Swedish affiliate of this
movement. Besides, the German activist Helga Zepp-LaRouche, Lyndon’s widow, president and founder of the Schiller Institute, has already been invited to a BRIX event. The
Chinese Embassy, which works regularly with BRIX (the ambassador participated in many
seminars), has funded at least one of their events. That the embassy chose to publicly
associate itself with the Schiller Institute came as a surprise in Sweden and was
perceived as “self-sabotage, given the organization’s bad reputation.”74

V. The Swedish case as an example of the Russification of
Chinese operations
Several features in the previous pages are symptomatic of a wider tendency highlighted in this report: the Russification of Chinese influence operations, which we will
develop again and in more details in our conclusion (→ p. 620). The first feature are the narratives used. The ill treatment of Chinese tourists is a subject that bridges the gap between
standard “positive” Chinese propaganda (about China) and “negative” propaganda (about
the host country) with which Russia has been familiar for years (even decades in Sweden’s
case). It still addresses the situation of Chinese nationals (and China) but chiefly in order to
criticize the host and it ultimately develops a narrative according to which liberal democracies are decadent and violent. With Gui Minha, the boot is on the other foot now: while
Sweden accused China of violating human rights and the rule of law, arbitrary arrests and the
bad treatment of prisoners (notably Gui Minhai), the Chinese tourist incident in Stockholm
gave Beijing the opportunity to turn the accusation around and claim that it was Sweden that
behaves abusively. This strategy of focusing on incidents, criminality, immigration,
Sweden’s alleged shortcomings, in order to deter tourism and portray Sweden as violent and unstable, is exactly what Russian media have been doing for years, just like the
American alt-right (see Trump’s “Last night in Sweden”).75
Second, this convergence of views between Russian and Chinese authorities, and
the American alt-right – all pursuing the same objective of breaking the model of a perfect and happy Swedish liberal society – is backed up by the links with extremist parties

and movements. In Stockholm, the embassy has close ties with the nationalist and populist far-right party Alternativ för Sverige (AfS representatives were present at the Chinese
embassy on the anniversary of Tian’anmen) which regularly relays pro-Beijing positions.
Then, of course, there is the Schiller Institute, as previously explained. Both are familiar
relations for Russia but relatively new ones for China, which confirms that China is
following the Russian path.
Finally, in light of all this, the diplomatic appointment of Gui Congyou to Sweden,
where Russia is very active, is less surprising than it seems. Indeed, Gui speaks fluent Russian, is an expert on Russia, and is in fact pro-Russian (in 2014, he publicly
supported the annexation of Crimea).76 Besides, the ambassador admitted that his understanding of Sweden was limited to reading the Russian press (Chinese media in Sweden
generally simply republish translated RT and Sputnik articles). All this makes sense if we
see the ambassador as having been sent to facilitate a local rapprochement with the
Russians, to learn from them and perhaps even to work with them on information
operations in Sweden of the kind that Moscow has been conducting for a long time.

Chapter 5

CANADA

Why is China interested in Canada? Because of the Chinese diaspora first and
foremost, and for the large number of assumed or presumed dissidents that lives in
the country. Jonathan Manthorpe explained that “Canada has become a hunting ground for
the CCP’s agents […] because the country has attracted so many immigrants from greater
China intent on escaping the CCP.”1 Indeed, out of 1.8 million Canadians that identify
as of Chinese origin – nearly 5% of the population2 – there might be at least 500,000
Hongkongers, 100,000 Taiwanese, nearly 5,000 Tibetans (the largest Tibetan diaspora
outside of Asia),3 and 2,000 Uyghurs (with 300 relatives of people detained in Chinese
camps).4 Besides, Canada – which was the first country (in 1999) to publicly condemn the
persecutions of Falun Gong members by Chinese authorities – is also a popular destination
for the followers of this spiritual movement. In other words, because China has made the
fight against the “five poisons” a priority, hence silencing advocates of Tibet, the Uyghurs,
Taiwan’s independence, democracy in China, and the Falun Gong, part of this fight needs
to be carried out in Canada.
Furthermore, Canada is an interesting target for other reasons, including its multiform proximity to the great U.S. rival, its membership in military (NATO) and intelligence (Five Eyes) alliances that have raised Beijing’s concern; its position as an Arctic
nation, a region of growing interest for China; its image as an exemplary liberal democracy, making Canada a symbolic target; and its status as an average power, which limits the
potential fallouts. Beijing also believes it is in a strong position due to Canada’s dependence
on the Chinese market – and Canadian universities to Chinese students – especially in British
Columbia. It is therefore understandable why Canada was described as a “second priority” for
Chinese intelligence, after the United States, according to the defector Chen Yonglin. During
a visit in Ottawa and Montreal in 2007, he stated that no less than “a thousand spies, whether
official or unofficial and occasional informers,” were working in Canada.5
For all these reasons, China is interested in Canada, and, as Charles Burton summarized it, it offered the following deal to the state: Beijing can help Canada dynam1. Jonathan Manthorpe, Claws of the Panda: Beijing’s Campaign of Influence and Intimidation in Canada (Toronto:

ize and diversify its economy (to make it less dependent on the United States) by giving
Canadian companies a better access to the immense Chinese market and promising colossal
Chinese investments in Canada, but under certain conditions. To that end, Ottawa needs
to “1) remove Canadian restrictions on Chinese state acquisition of Canadian mineral and
energy resources; 2) remove restrictions on export of high technology (including with military applications) to China; 3) allow the PRC to freely extradite Chinese nationals in Canada
to face Chinese justice; and 4) cease all criticism of China’s domestic and international policies and shape public opinion to support better understanding of the critical importance
to Canada of enhanced engagement with the PRC.”6 This deal is basically meant to incite
Ottawa to do Beijing’s work in Canada, so that the CCP “could be simply focused first
on suppression of discourse damaging to China’s international image and prestige and second on neutralizing Chinese dissident voices in Canada.”7
As Canada refused the deal, particularly after the 2018 crisis strained bilateral relations (→ p. 544), Beijing has become more offensive. J. Michael Cole, a Taiwan-based
former analyst at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), and one of the leading Canadian experts on Chinese influence, affirms that Beijing uses its entire repertoire of actions in Canada: China is not only engaged in traditional diplomacy but
also uses “instruments of political warfare to divide Canadian society, manipulate decision-making in Ottawa, co-opt or use potential partners in government or parliament,
sow confusion through disinformation and CCP-front organizations, interfere in electoral processes, and, where it feels it is necessary, to undertake more direct, punitive
action, such as lawfare against Beijing’s critics and by ‘weaponizing’ both Chinese
students and trade.”8
The diversity and reach of Chinese interference make the Canadian case comparable to
Australia. And Canada and Australia are very often compared, for reasons that are as much
historical (the British crown) as geographical (large size, low density, uneven distribution of
the population over the territory), political (a federal system, a multicultural society, “First
Nations” or Aboriginals) or economic (GDP, growth, important raw materials, especially
ore, etc.). The two cases are also similar in terms of Chinese influence: Jonathan Manthorpe
noted that “the Australian experience of infiltration by the CCP is almost exactly
the same as that of Canada.”9 This similarity is tied to the comparable trajectory of their
Chinese diasporas which, in Canada like in Australia, were initially made up of former
Hong Kong and Taiwan inhabitants, and Chinese dissidents (the post-Tian’anmen wave of
immigrants), but the new generation, which is now more numerous, comes mainly from
mainland China, migrated for essentially economic reasons, and is therefore more likely to
be a target and vector of Chinese influence operations.
The CSIS has long tried to draw the attention of the government, and even of the
public, to this threat, through publications (a joint report on the Sidewinder Operation
with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1997, kept secret at first but eventually
disclosed (see below)10; a 1998 report on the strategy of the United Front in Hong Kong11;

a 2006 report on Confucius Institutes after the first one was inaugurated in Canada (at the
British Columbia Institute of Technology)12; and, more recently, a 2018 report on China and
the Age of Strategic Rivalry13) but also several public interventions by its successive directors
(→ p. 543 and 549).

I. An old story
Chinese influence operations have deep roots in Canada.14 Surveillance, infiltration,
and harassment on college campuses, among other things, which are much talked about
today, were already used to monitor the fallout of Tian’anmen in 1989. “In Vancouver, for
example, Chinese students at the University of British Columbia who had participated in
protests complained publicly of being filmed, photographed, harassed, and blackmailed.
Some have even received threatening phone calls. For others, it was their families back in
China who were subjected to reprisals.”15 The same thing happened to pro-Tibet activists,
Falun Gong followers, and Taiwanese independentists – all have long been targeted.
The 1984 announcement of the retrocession of Hong Kong to China, in 1997,
created a climate of insecurity in the population (reinforced by the Tian’anmen massacre
in 1989), and provoked a massive wave of emigration, of which Canada was one of the
main destinations. In 1997, a secret report of the Canadian Mounted Police and the CSIS,
untitled Sidewinder: Chinese intelligence services and Triads financial links in Canada, highlighted
some of its consequences on Chinese influence in Canada.
By the end of the 1980s, Western intelligence services detected strengthening
UFWD activities in Hong Kong, notably tasked with establishing connections with
the Triads, which were already tied to business circles.16 Incidentally, more than 237,000
Hong Kong residents moved to Canada between January 1990 and March 1997, of which
70,000 were “entrepreneurs” and “investors.”17 In 1997, more than 500,000 Hongkongers
presumably lived in Canada, approximately 22% of the immigrant population.
Between January 1990 and March 1997, most of the newly-arrived Hongkongers registered
as “entrepreneurs” or “investors” settled in British Columbia (39.1%) – especially in the
Fraser Valley, in the Vancouver region – but also in Ontario, in Toronto especially (28.5%),
and, to a lesser extent, in Quebec (20.6%) and Alberta (7.3%).18
However, some of these rich businessmen and investors, witht ties to the Triads
and Chinese intelligence services, immediately bought a Canadian company,
through a Canadian relative as intermediary when necessary – “so as to obtain a ‘local identity,’ legally and subtly concealing their foreign identity.”19 Then, thanks to this first company, they invested massively, or bought additional Canadian companies in different
fields, “but always under the Canadian banner.” Moreover, they also took care to associate

themselves with influential Canadian politicians – “offering them positions on their
boards of directors” – and to invest first in “soft” (non-sensitive) sectors such as real
estate, transportations, energy and travel agencies – in order to avoid drawing scrutiny from
Canadian intelligence. With time, they acquired companies in more sensitive sectors, such
as in high-tech. The CSIS noted that “over 200 Canadian companies [were] under
Chinese control” in 1997.20
This poses several problems, including the fact that these companies have allowed
Beijing to consolidate its influence in Canada by indirectly financing the two major
political parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals – a practice otherwise commonly used
elsewhere in the world (especially in the United States, where more than 2,000 firms were
suspected of having been used by China to illegally finance the Democratic Party). But the
main problem, according to Canadian intelligence services, was that “some Chinese owners
are now able to use the Canadian companies they have purchased and some of the political
channels they have developed to obtain research assistance and even classified contracts.
Once access is obtained, few things are in place to prevent them from repatriating the fruits
of this research or classified information in China” because “most of this can be done
legally.”21 For instance, some of these Canadian companies controlled by Beijing are in the
security sector, including IT and video surveillance, and are likely to pass contracts with
the Canadian government. Furthermore, the report noted that “these triads now use their
Canadian acquisitions to engage in intelligence activities, such as intimidating individuals, identifying potential sources of facilitating visit of Chinese delegations on behalf of
China.”22
Drafted in 1997, this visionary report concluded that “China remains one of the
greatest ongoing threats to Canada’s national security and Canadian industry”
and that “the great difficulties in determining the threat is that it is diverse and
multi-layered. It diffuses itself through elaborated networks held by a cultural practice
that still is not well understood by Western services.”23
Chinese immigration to Canada has changed since 1997: Hongkongers are no longer a
majority of migrants. For diverse reasons, including an increasing living standard in China
(some Chinese settle in Canada to invest money), “the majority of Chinese-Canadians
in Canada are from mainland China” nowadays.24 Compared to previous generations
of Hong Kong and Taiwanese immigrants, they are alienated from Canada’s democratic
and liberal culture and are understandably more likely to support Beijing. In other words, if
only for demographic reasons, the risk of Chinese influence in Canada has increased
over the past two decades.
At the time, the Sidewinder report was coldshouldered by Canadian elected officials,
who refused to admit that Beijing was a threat – so much so that, according to testimonies gathered by Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuaya, “there was political
interference at the highest level to torpedo the report and discredit its authors.”25 As a
result, it “was simply thrown away in 1997 before being replaced, in 1999, by a softer and
more consensual version,” despite the fact that, in May 1999, on the other side of the

border, the “Cox Report”26 came to the same conclusions on Chinese activities in
the United States: “shell companies, pseudo-research and cooperation institutes, joint
ventures between North American companies and China, use of student delegations,
journalists, etc., to gather data, often from open sources, all tactics that are also used in
Canada.”27
In the 2000s, bilateral irritants accumulated. Mei Ping, the Chinese ambassador
in Ottawa between 1998 and 2005 had already displayed an aggressive behavior – especially when dealing with Falun Gong members. He regularly penned letters and contacted Canadian politicians to dissuade them from getting in touch with these “mentally
damaged” “heretics.”28 In 2001, the magazine The Chinese Press, based in Montreal’s
Chinatown, circulated a series of anti-Falun Gong pamphlets accusing the followers
of bestiality, vampirism and of being driven to suicide – despite a court order enjoining them to stop these attacks. The newspaper did it again in 2006 with a special edition of 100,000 copies. A Chinese “defector” previously tasked with persecuting Falun
Gong followers noted that an operation of such magnitude was probably “financed by
Beijing.”29 Besides, the frequent visits of the Dalai-lama (2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2012)
– the third person in Canada’s history to receive the title of honorary citizen in June
2006, after Nelson Mandela and Raoul Wallenberg – and the absence of the Canadian
Prime Minister at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games in August 2008
did not help either.
Likewise, China’s spying activities and influence operations intensified during
the 2000s. In April 2007, Jim Judd, then-director of the CSIS, admitted during a hearing of
the Senate Permanent Committee on National Security that Chinese operations took no
less than half the Canadian counterespionage’s time.30 One symptom of this disproportionate spying activity is the growing number of employees working at the embassy: it
suggests that many are “diplomats” in-name-only. In 2008, the Chinese embassy in Canada
had 120 accredited diplomats, twice as much as the U.S. embassy, Canada’s main economic
partner. This number went “beyond the traditional needs of an embassy”31 and indicated
that many of the employees were apparently intelligence officers working under a diplomatic cover.
Despite recurring alerts from the CSIS and cases that regularly come out in the
press, political resistance – i.e. the propensity of elected officials to see China as
a partner more than as a threat – remains important in Canada, for reasons that
are both historical and cultural; this is more blatant than in Australia, where a consensus
emerged in the political sphere circa 2017 on the importance of the Chinese threat (see
the box below).

II. The 2018 Crisis and Its Aftermath
For several reasons, Canadians have become more aware of the problem since
2018. First, as pointed out by Charles Burton, the situation in Australia created a precedent that rippled onto Canada.32 Because both countries are particularly similar, they
watch each other, compare each other, and Australia’s actions to counter Chinese influence
in 2017-2018 (see the box below) sparked a debate in Canada about whether to do the
same. Some, like the former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney, praised the
Australian efforts and asserted that “much of what Australia has done could be applied in
Canada.”33 Yet, many proponents of appeasement have opposed such measures and
instead emphasized the particularities and, therefore, the non-replicability of the Australian
case; the need to be reasonable and avoid anti-China hysteria demonstrated by both
Australia and the United States; the fact that the Chinese-Canadian relationship should not
be reduced to its sole security dimension; and the efficiency of the current counter-intelligence mechanism.34 All arguments that can be found among those, especially in Europe,
who still underestimate the threat posed by Chinese influence nowadays.

The Australian Awakening
China was a decisive actor in the economic growth of Australia for the past three decades.
As such, Australia’s awakening to the fact that China is not (only) an opportunity, but
(also) a threat for the country has emerged gradually. In 2015 first, when a controversy erupted over a 99-year lease granted by the government of the Northern Territory to a
Chinese company over the port of Darwin (a strategic infrastructure). The United States,
who keep a Marines contingent not far, protested, and a polemic ensued, with some voices
calling for the renationalization of the port. Hence, Australians took notice of the importance
of protecting critical infrastructures, and the government created a Critical Infrastructure
Center in January 2007, among other measures.
The Sam Dastyari affair, in 2016, was another step. This Labor senator, who adopted certain
pro-Beijing positions (“The South China Sea is China’s own affair. On this issue, Australia
should remain neutral and respect China’s decision”), admitted that he had accepted financial
contributions from Chinese companies.35 It wasn’t a lone case and several parties were blamed:
between 2014 and 2016, the Liberal and Labor parties presumably received $5.5 million
from individuals and companies tied to China. “Chinese donors are by the far the first
donors coming from outside of the country.”36
In August 2016, the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commissioned a secret investigation on foreign interference, the results of which “galvanized” the government and convinced it to adopt a targeted strategy. And the tempo accelerated in 2017. In May, Defense
Secretary Dennis Richardson publicly declared that “it is no secret that China is very active in
intelligence activities directed against us. […] It is more than cyber. The Chinese government
keeps a watchful eye inside Australian Chinese communities and effectively controls some
Chinese language media in Australia.”37 As his Canadian counterpart, the executive director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), Duncan Lewis, noted

that foreign interference was an “existential threat,” “by far and away the most serious
issue going forward,” even more than terrorism.38
More and more articles, investigations, and reports on Chinese influence have been released,
including for the general public, such as a TV documentary on “the hard edge of China’s soft
power” which was broadcast in June 2017. It revealed that ASIO had disclosed to the two main
Australian political parties that two generous donators were tied to the CCP.39-40 “One of them
leveraged a $400,000 donation in an attempt to soften the Labor Party line on the South
China Sea.”41
In June 2018, Australia passed two laws against espionage and foreign interferences,42
and it created a national coordinator to counter foreign interference. Australia also became the first country to exclude Huawei from its 5G network that same year.
The Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 was another step forward, with Canberra questioning Beijing’s
responsibility and demanding an independent investigation into the origin of the virus. In response, Beijing deployed a range of retaliatory measures, including trade sanctions (→ p. 246).
In December 2020, the Australian parliament adopted a bill to endow the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs with the power to scrutinize international agreements signed by the federated
states (incidently, the federal government announced the cancellation of the Victorian Labor
government’s BRI agreement with China in April 2021), but also by the municipalities and
the universities (which obviously targets Confucius Institutes → p. 299).43

In May 2018, and with that context in mind, Canadian authorities decided to deny
a visa to 200 Chinese citizens planning to attend the 9th Conference of the World
Guangdong Community Federation (第九届世界广东同乡联谊大会) in Vancouver.
Jointly organized by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of China of Guangdong and
the Guangdong Community Association of Canada, it was set in North America for the
first time. The organizers expected 2,000 participants from around the world but 200
of them, including some 20 Chinese officials from Guangdong, were denied access to
Canada, which displeased Beijing. This unusual and daring decision, from a Canadian
government that had long avoided offending China, was interpreted as a measure
of reciprocity to the practice, common on the Chinese side, of denying visas to
Canadian citizens.44 It could be also be interpreted as an attempt to draw a limit on
the activities of the United Front in Canada, as this meeting was of a particular magnitude. That said, the event was still a success for the United Front, partly due to the participation of the province’s prime minister but also to the forceful images of Vancouver
policemen in uniform saluting the Chinese flag. Moreover, retired Canadian soldiers were seen carrying the PRC flag (see pictures). The Canadian decision weighted
on the bilateral relationship nevertheless.

Community Federation in Vancouver, in May 2018.46

The turning point came six months later with the Huawei affair, which remains the
most serious crisis in the history of the Sino-Canadian bilateral relationship. Meng
Wanzhou (孟晚 舟), the vice-chair of the board of directors and chief financial officer
of Huawei, was arrested in Vancouver on December 1, 2018, following a U.S. arrest warrant. Beijing immediately retaliated, first by arresting two Canadians living in China nine
days later, the “two Michaels” (Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat turned advisor to the
International Crisis Group, and Michael Spavor, head of an organization promoting tours
of North Korea) without justification. They were held in inacceptable conditions (no consular access, and at least one, M. Kovrig, in a cell with no access to daylight). They were
formally charged with espionage on June 19, 2020, a few weeks after (so presumably in
response to) Meng Wenzhou’s failed appeal to the Canadian courts. And they were released
on September 25, 2021, the same day that Meng Wanzhou, who was under house arrest in
Vancouver, was allowed to return to China – which confirms that Beijing has been exercising against Canada an hostage diplomacy it is familiar with (→ p. 411).

The Abduction of Canadian Citizens
There are precedents for the “two Michaels,” including Sun Qian, a Canadian citizen kidnapped during one of her trips to Beijing; another took place in a third country: Huseyincan
Celil, a Uyghur imam who fled to Canada with his family in 2001 and obtained the Canadian
citizenship. In 2006, as he visited the family of his spouse in Uzbekistan, he was arrested by
the Uzbek police and handed over to Chinese authorities, who sentenced him to fifteen
years in jail for terrorism. They branded him a member of the Islamic Movement of Eastern
Turkestan, despite official protests from Canada.47

Beijing also adopted trade sanctions: they barred almost all Canadian exports of canola
seeds, and seriously limited those of soy, peas, pork meat and beef. Finally, the aggravated
situation of several Canadian citizens already detained by Beijing can also be interpreted
as part of the Chinese response to the arrest of Meng: Robert Schellenberg, serving a
fifteen-year sentence for drug trafficking, was suddenly sentenced to death, followed by
Fan Wei, another Canadian, several months later.48 Sun Qian, a Canadian member of Falun
Gong who had been detained for three years, was subsequently sentenced to a particularly
hefty eight years in prison.49
During this crisis, the Chinese ambassador in Canada, Lu Shaye, who became ambassador to France in July 2019, showed notable aggressiveness, on a par with his colleague
in Stockholm (→ p. 523). Both were precursors of the so-called “wolf warrior” diplomacy
described in part three (→ p. 222). For instance, in an op-ed published in January 2019 in
the Hill Times, he attacked “Western egotism and white supremacy” and criticized what he
called “double standards” because Canada was demanding the release of its two citizens
detained in China as a retaliatory measure but refused to release Huawei’s CFO (who was
in fact released on bail and whose rights were protected, unlike the two Canadian hostages
in China).50 He failed to convince however: public perception of China has dramatically
worsened since the beginning of the crisis. A poll conducted between December 30 and
January 5, 2019 showed that more than 80% of Canadians viewed Chinese authorities
negatively.51
Likewise, the publication of Jonathan Manthorpe’s book, Claws of the Panda: Beijing’s
Campaign of Influence and Intimidation in Canada, in 2019, provoked a debate and contributed to a growing mistrust of Beijing among Canadian politicians and citizens. Overall,
revelations in recent years about espionage, influence operations, mass detention and even, according to some, a Uyghur genocide, along with the violent
repression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong have, during this
period, considerably damaged China’s image in Canada, as elsewhere in the
world.
As a consequence, Beijing hired a PR company to improve its image, as shown by the
Karen Woods case. Karen Li Woods, a cofounder of the Canadian Chinese Political

Affairs Committee (CCPAC), is a well-known commentator of Sino-Canadian relations,
and she was all-the-more visible after Meng Wanzhou’s arrest. She published a tribune
in the Toronto Star, the most widely-read newspaper in the country, to explain that the
Huawei case constituted “a dark cloud shrouding the psyche of many Chinese Canadians”
and that people should be alert to the rise of “a new wave of Sino-Phobia.”52 But she
failed to disclose that her employer, the lobbying firm Solstice Public Affairs, listed
the Chinese Consulate General in Toronto among its clients, notably tasked with
organizing meetings with Canadian congressmen to “promote various economic and cultural relations” between the two countries.53 At the time, it was the sole known case of a
foreign government hiring a private company in Canada to improve its image, something
usually tasked to diplomats.54 Following the ensuing polemic, the Toronto Star decided to
add a “clarification” on her op-ed, disclosing the link tying the author to the Chinese
General Consulate. Jonathan Manthorpe described the affair as “a good example of the
vigilance needed not only by Chinese-Canadian communities, but [the] Canadian society
in general to identify United Front operations, and the difficulties of being certain of the
evidence.”55
China’s responsibility and behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic continued to
heighten tensions in 2020. In April, the MP Erin O’Toole – who was elected leader of the
Conservatives in August, thus the chief opponent to Justin Trudeau’s government – said
that Canada was “on the brink of a new Cold War with China,”56 while Peter MacKay,
another conservative, demanded that laws akin to the “Magnitsky Act” and others be used
to target the Chinese responsible for the pandemic.57
That said, these hardliners are opposed by supporters of appeasement with
Beijing. In June 2020, 19 eminent Canadians, including two former ministers of foreign
affairs, Lloyd Axworthy and Lawrence Cannon, published an open letter to Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau calling for the release of Meng Wanzhou – a unilateral end to the extradition
process – to incite China to release the two Canadian hostages (the “two Michaels”). In
fact, the letter insisted on the need to “redefine the Canadian strategy toward China”
to avoid antagonizing it. Trudeau wasn’t convinced and explained that “releasing Meng
Wanzhou to resolve a short-term problem would endanger thousands of Canadians who
travel to China and around the world by letting countries know that a government can have
political influence over Canada by randomly arresting Canadians.”58 In other words, yielding to the kidnappers’ demands would encourage more kidnappings. In another
open letter published on September 18, 2020, a hundred anonymous former diplomats
also called for the release of Meng in exchange for the “two Michaels.”59 In any case, the
proponents of the transactional approach were successful, confirming the effectiveness of

the Chinese hostage diplomacy: the two Michaels were released on September 25, 2021 in
exchange for the release of Meng Wanzhou (→ p. 411).
Separately, the Uyghur question has grown more prevalent in the Canadian public
debate, with notable political consequences: on January 12, 2021, Canada, along with the
United Kingdom, announced measures “to address human rights abuses in Xinjiang.”60
Among the seven measures announced by the Canadian government are increased controls
on exports to China and a ban on the import of forced labor goods. This move, while
symbolic (unlike the British, the Canadians do not provide for financial sanctions against
companies that do not comply with these rules), confirmed that the bilateral crisis, which
is multi-faceted, is likely to last. David Vigneault, director of the CSIS, said as much on
February 9, 2021, when he acknowledged that the Chinese government was “using all elements of state power to carry out activities that are a direct threat to our national security
and sovereignty.” He mentioned the special Chinese operation Fox Hunt (猎狐专项行
动), for instance, which, in the name of the fight against corruption, has been “used to
target and quiet dissidents to the regime. […] Those threatened often lack the resources to
defend themselves or are unaware that they can report these activities to Canadian authorities, including us. Moreover, these activities are different from the norms of diplomatic
activity because they cross the line by attempting to undermine our democratic processes
or threaten our citizens in a covert and clandestine manner.”61

III. The Efforts to Silent Dissenting Voices
There are many well-documented cases of harassment and intimidation of
Canadian citizens and residents that Beijing sees as dissidents or threats. They
mainly, but not exclusively, concern people closely tied to what the CCP considers as the
five poisons (Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong followers, pro-democracy and Taiwanese
independentists).
In 2009, Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya already wrote that “for
years, China’s main objective in Canada has been to control anything that is perceived as a
dissent. Its intelligence services, along with its diplomats, spend time, energy and money
discrediting or intimidating its opponents, conducting clandestine operations to infiltrate
and manipulate pro-democracy, community and student groups.”62 Indeed, several affairs
had previously underscored the role of Chinese diplomats in the surveillance, infiltration, and harassment of a number of groups branded as dissidents, especially
Falun Gong members. In 2004, for example, the Chinese vice-Consul General in Toronto,
Pan Xinchun, was convicted of defamation against a businessman tied to Falun Gong.
Elsewhere, the police saw two members of the Chinese consulate in Calgary distributing
“heinous literature,” during a conference at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton: two

pamphlets, including one with an explicit title (Falun Gong is an evil cult), “illustrated with
bloody images of immolations, crimes and suicides.”63
In 2006, the visa of Wang Pengfei, Deputy Secretary to the Bureau of Education at the
Chinese embassy in Ottawa, wasn’t renewed, and he was invited to leave Canada after it
became known that he “was specifically tasked with documenting Falun Gong practitioners
in Canada and making life difficult for them.”64 Actually, he not-so-discretely relied on “the
twenty or so Chinese student associations established in the country’s main universities,” as
illustrated by an article published in 2004 by the Chinese Scholar Abroad Magazine in which he
thanked the president of a UQAM student association for its “propaganda activities […]
and its brave and resourceful activities against Falun Gong.”65
In March 2017, the Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China, to which Amnesty
International belongs, released a report “to draw attention to an organized and sustained
campaign of intimidation and harassment aimed at activists working on Chinarelated human rights issues in Canada, in circumstances suggesting the involvement or backing of Chinese government officials.”66 In an update released in March
2020, the same organizations concluded that, three years later, “the situation is worsening, […]: incidents of interference have become increasingly pervasive across different spheres of society, including a growing array of tactics and have expanded
beyond traditional targets.”67

A. Systematic, Aggressive Counter-Demonstrations
The pro-democratic Hong Kong protests organized in Canada in 2019 nearly systematically led to particularly aggressive pro-Beijing counter-demonstrations that mobilized at least dozens (often hundreds) of protestors in cities (clashes occurred in Toronto,
Vancouver, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa and Richmond, in British Columbia) and on campuses. But these demonstrations usually were not the “spontaneous actions of individuals.”68
There was evidence of “coordination and organization between [counter-] protestors and Chinese officials.”69 The counter-demonstrations usually begun on WeChat,
with messages “suggesting that marchers should be followed, confronted and beaten up”
– such as during the 2019 Montreal Pride. On that occasion, pro-Beijing demonstrators
attacked LGBT marchers favorable to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.70
Some pro-democracy demonstrators are sometimes intimidated, or even dissuaded, by
an invisible, more pernicious threat: photos of them could be shot during demonstrations, then identified, in particular through facial recognition technologies and, once their
identities are known to Beijing, there would be consequences for them (risk of arrest
if they travel to China) or for their relatives (pressure or intimidation of various
kinds).71 Distance is no refuge here: even on the UBC campus, in Canada, pro-democracy

students wore masks to hide their identity when they demonstrated, like their counterparts
in Hong Kong.72

B. Targeted Campaigns of Harassment and Intimidation
The fate of actress Sheng Xue (her real name is Zang Xihong) is exemplary of such
attacks. She fled China after Tian’anmen and settled in Canada in 1989 to study journalism.
She subsequently remained there and became a writer and human rights activist. In 1996,
she understood that Beijing had blacklisted her as she attempted to travel to China and was
arrested, interrogated, and turned away at the airport.
In 2012, a month after receiving a medal from the Canadian government, she was
elected president of the Federation for a Democratic China. From that moment on, she
was targeted by a systematic and very sophisticated slander campaign that started
the very day of her first conference as the president of the federation, in front of hundreds of persons that came from all over the world. As she was on stage, her colleagues
received emails with – fake – naked pictures of her. More came later: doctored images
of her naked were posted on Twitter and many stories on her purported unrestrained
sexual life were relayed online by anonymous blogs. This organized campaign, which
involved fake accounts on social networks pretending to be those of other pro-democracy activists, apparently sought to create divisions within the movement, and it
succeeded: membership in the Federation for a Democratic China rapidly fell from 3000
to 100, as the group split into two organizations in 2017, and Sheng Xue resigned. When
a Chinese-Canadian human rights lawyer, and friend of Sheng Xue, tried to gather evidence of this slander campaign in 2016, his computer was hacked and “all the documents
disappeared.”73
There are many other, less publicized, examples that targeted leaders of the Hong
Kong community in Canada, such as Cherie Wong, executive director of Alliance Canada
HK. She claimed to have been targeted by “coordinated attacks on social networks,”
including rape and death threats. Once more, WeChat was used to incite hatred and
to relay calls to harass the woman dubbed “Mrs. Hong Kong Independence” by
pro-Beijing activists. Cherie Wong received threatening calls, and explained that she had
been followed and photographed while walking in Ottawa.74 Gloria Fung, president of
Canada-Hong Kong Link, was presumably victim of the same intimidation techniques.75
These techniques are neither recent nor limited to the events in Hong Kong. Phone calls,
often in the middle of the night, are a common means of intimidation. These messages,
often pre-recorded, include insults, sometimes death threats, or play nationalistic songs
praising the Party.76 In September 2010, Tao Wang, a NTDTV reporter who had settled
in Canada three years earlier, disclosed to the press that he had received phone calls from
MSS agents uttering death threats.77 Owner of a company in China, he explained that
his clients there had been visited by MSS agents telling them that he “was taking part to ille72. Marie-Danielle Smith, “In the Battle Over Hong Kong, the Surveillance State Knows no Boundaries,” Maclean’s

gal activities in Canada that were damaging to the national security of China, and they asked
them to cease doing business with [his] company.” When he refused to sign a written statement barring him from taking part to political activities in Canada, Tao received another,
more threatening, phone call: “they told me ‘do you seriously think that we can’t do
anything to you because you are in Canada?’” Or, “if you speak publicly, you’re playing
with death.’” That same day, his company’s bank accounts were frozen in China and his ten
employees threatened with unemployment. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigated this case.
Similarly, in May 2016, the Toronto-based writer Xin Feng published on the Chinesespeaking website sinophone51.ca an article critical of the Chinese minister of foreign
affairs, Wang Yi, during the latter’s visit to Canada. He was subsequently victim of a campaign of hatred. Among the many comments posted below his article, one could read: “‘Be
careful that your whole family does not get killed, be careful when you walk outside!’
or ‘Butcher this pig. He’s an animal, not a human.’”78

C. Family and Friends in China Used as Leverage
It is well known that an effective way to get someone to give in is the indirect
strategy of threatening to harm their loved ones. And it is even easier when they live in
China. The threats are varied: they risk losing their jobs, being arrested, assaulted, or even
– in the case of the Uyghurs in particular – simply disappearing.
Anastasia Lin’s case is well-known because she is a Chinese-born celebrity who immigrated to Canada at age 13, became a recognized actress and model, won the 2015 Miss
World Canada pageant and now works as a human rights advocate. In a profile by The
Washington Post, she explained how her father, the CEO of an important Chinese company,
received threats and how, “no doubt fearing for his livelihood and business,” he asked her
to cease being an activist.79 Chinese authorities wielded both the stick (they confiscated
her father’s passport, revoked her family’s visas to visit Hong Kong) and the carrot (they
brought baskets of fruits and flowers to her grandparents hoping that they could convince
her to keep quiet).80
Coercing relatives is very commonly used against Uyghurs. One night in 2004,
Mehmet Tohti, the president of the Uyghur Canadian Association, received a phone call
from his mother, who lived in Kargilik, in Xinjiang, and whom he had not seen since he
fled China sixteen years earlier. His mother quickly passed him on to a man who identified
himself as an officer from the Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs. He enjoined him to stop
defending the Uyghur cause in Canada and to avoid taking part to a conference planned in
Germany with other groups of exiled Uyghurs. He added that he held his brother and
mother in the police headquarters in Kasghar – from where they called – some 300 kilometers away from their home, and that he could ultimately do “whatever [he] want[ed]”
with them.81

Elsewhere, a Uyghur refugee in Montreal told a journalist: “I received a Facebook message telling me that the Chinese government had arrested my mother, my brother, and my
father. During their transfer to jail, my mother had a heart attack. My sister was incarcerated
in a special prison where prisoners were tied up in a cell full of water. [Then,] I received
another message telling me that my father had died. No one in my family was authorized
to attend the funeral. Only six Chinese officials were there.”82 The Uyghur community in
France speaks of similar tactics: “We receive phone calls during which we are told that they
know everything about our family and that, if we say bad things about the government,
something bad will happen to them….”83

D. Permanent Surveillance
The members of the tiny Uyghur community in Montreal have repeatedly explained
that they feel under permanent surveillance. One of them added that they have all
“received strange phone calls from the Chinese embassy. A prerecorded message tells
them to go pick up a package at the Chinese embassy immediately. We never go because
we know that there is not anything to pick up there. Once, I checked the phone number on Google and found that it was the number of the Chinese consulate in Texas,
and not the one in Toronto as told in the message. Sometimes, they use fake numbers.
I think they want us to know that, even if we live abroad, they can control us
and gather information on us.”84 Another said that his car was robbed, his official
documents ostensibly stolen, that he was taken in tail from his home by “a Chinese person” and that, ultimately, that kind of things happens “very often.”85 Even in France,
Uyghurs feel under permanent surveillance: “when we protest, there is always someone
filming to spy on us.”86

E. Cyberattacks
Chinese has well-known cyber offensive capabilities. In 2018, at a seminar on cybersecurity, the text of CSIS Director Vigneault’s speech presented China as “one of the
biggest threats facing our countries” in this area (“one of ” was truncated in the transcript, meaning that China was presented as the greatest threat).87 On top of recurring
attacks against state institutions and large companies – retaliation or espionage
– Beijing knows how to use its cyber capabilities against identified dissidents.
In June 2013, for instance, Canadian Tibetan organizations received an email allegedly

84. The Chinese consulate in Houston, which was closed down by American authorities on July 23, 2020, was
known as a “nest of spies” tasked with intimidating dissidents, among others things. See U.S. Embassy in Georgia,
“China’s Houston Consulate a Center of Malign Activity,” https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-houston-consulate-acenter-of- malign-activity/. Hence, it is not unconceivable that some of its activities were conducted throughout North
America – including Canada – and not solely in the United States.

sent by a known member of the community, through a mailing list, with three Word
documents (.doc) attached to it. Citizen Lab, a laboratory at the Munk School of Global
Affairs of the University of Toronto, determined that these documents contained a
malware of the “Surtr” family which had been used against the Tibetan community
since at least November 2012. Once activated, this spying software is capable – among
other things – to record keystrokes on a keyboard, explore the content of the infected
computer, and execute commands at a distance. Analysts concluded that “attackers
actively monitor mailing lists and discussion groups used by the Tibetan community and repurpose the content for use in targeted malware attacks.”88
This is not an exception: Citizen Lab presented similar cases in a report published
the following year.89 According to one of the Tibetan groups targeted by several of
these attacks, at least a few of them are attributable to the infamous APT1, known as
PLA Unit 61398.90 On March 24, 2021, Facebook announced it had blocked another
group of Chinese hackers, known as “Earth Empusa,” or “Evil Eye,” which – hidden behind fake identities (human rights activists, students, journalists, etc.) – used the
social network to approach, and then infect, the computers of their targets, Uyghurs,
by sending them links to booby-trapped websites (containing viruses or malwares)
some of which looked like Uyghur media. Most of the targeted Uyghurs lived abroad,
in Canada for instance (but also in Turkey, Kazakhstan, in the United States, Syria or
Australia as well).91

F. Identity Thefts
Attackers sent insulting emails to MPs and government officers while impersonating Falun Gong members to discredit them.92 This is a common practice not limited to Canada, as explained by a member of the Canadian association of Falun Gong:
“Government officials at all levels in numerous countries have been systematically and
repeatedly targeted by fraudulent emails from persons claiming to be Falun Gong practitioners. The emails often portray the sender as obsessive, irrational, and rude, thus lending
legitimacy to the Chinese regime’s claims that Falun Gong is a menace to society […] Some
of the emails have been traced to IP addresses originating in China.”93 In Canada, such
offensive – sometimes threatening – emails were sent by individuals introducing themselves
as Falun Gong members to politicians, including to MPs Judy Sgro in December 2017 and
Peter Julian in March 2019.94

G. Travel restrictions
Several Canadian activists were denied a Chinese visa, or werearrested, detained
and intimidated in Chinese airports – and ultimately “forced to leave China despite
entering the country legitimately.”95 In 2019, Chinese-born Canadian politician Richard
Lee revealed that, in 2015, when he was a MP and vice-president of the Legislative
Assembly of British Columbia, he was detained by Chinese authorities after landing at
Shanghai Airport. He was kept away from his wife for eight hours, his professional phone
(property of the government of British Columbia) confiscated and hacked, and they
called him a “threat to the national security” of China.96 They eventually cancelled his
visa and sent him back to Canada. His case shows that Beijing can turn its surveillance
and counter-measures against any Canadian citizen or resident, whatever their status
may be. Indeed, Lee was not an activist, but an elected official who did not hesitate to
defend the democratic and liberal values of his country, Canada. He commemorates the
Tian’anmen massacre every year for instance – something that may have angered Chinese
authorities (the Chinese consul in Vancouver, Liu Fei, had told him as much, directly and
through his Liberal Party). The fact that even an MP, vice-president of a provincial
legislative assembly, could be targeted really means, as he acknowledged it, that
“it could happen to anyone.”97

H. Conclusion
To sum up, “the attacks range from abusive midnight phone calls to character assassinations in social media, intimidation of Chinese students attending Canadian colleges and universities, holding hostage in China the family members of Canadian
dissidents, and hacking the communications networks of dissident groups […]. In
all cases, however, the aim is to smother the voices of dissent in Canada, either by
intimidating Canadians into silence or by so discrediting them that what they say or
do no longer has public or political impact.”98
According to Hao Fengjun, a former agent who “defected” from the 610 Office (610
办公室), an entity fighting against Falun Gong (→ p. 78), the CCP operates an anti-Falun Gong spying network of more than one thousand agents in Canada – Chinese
Canadians recruited in Canada, professional agents from China, businesspersons and students – with activities seemingly concentrated in Vancouver and Toronto.99 According to
Zhang Jiyan, the wife of an accountant at the Chinese embassy in Ottawa who, in 2007,
“defected” and sought asylum in Canada, the embassy had, at the time, “a special unit of
about ten people ‘in charge of collecting information on groups that could present a threat,
especially on Falun Gong practitioners.’”100 She added that they infiltrated Tai-chi and
Qigong clubs to find them. She also explained that the unit produced “material inciting
hatred against Falun Gong” transmitted by the ambassador himself to “members of parlia95. Ibid., 3.

ment, officers in the Canadian government, and to the former Governor General.” Zhang
Jiyan also disclosed a confidential memo (see below) to the press stating that one of the
goals of this unit “was to use members of the diaspora and students to block the licensing
of the Mandarin-language television station New Tang Dynasty Television (NTDTV) by
sending petitions and letters of protest. […] Pressure was also put on a Canadian cable
company to discourage it from providing NTDTV to its subscribers.”101 Zhang Jiyan was
eventually granted refugee status in Canada.

The overseas representatives of Beijing, here its ambassador and consuls in
Canada, are directly involved in the intimidation campaigns because they themselves pen letters to members of government, elected officials, media outlets asking
them to avoid any contact with such and such groups labeled as dissidents. In 2005, for
instance, following the announcement of an imminent visit of the Dalai-lama, Chinese
Consul General in Toronto Chen Xiaoling personally wrote a “warning letter” to 44 city
councilors asking them to “neither authorize, nor facilitate” the visit, unless they did not
want to maintain good relations with China.103 “Most of these letters concludes with a
not-so-subtle warning. [One] coarse strategy, which can be assimilated to harassment
because of its magnitude.”104
Canada is but one example: similar cases testifying to the harassment and intimidation methods used against human rights activists have been documented in the
United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand for example105 – in
other words, in all the liberal democratic countries with a significant Chinese diaspora. As
we saw in the previous part, Beijing set up the largest transnational repression campaign in the world (→ p. 166).

IV. A Chinese Willingness to Influence Politics
A. Politicians under influence
Beijing keeps close tabs on foreign politicians with Chinese roots: a training manual for
executives of the United Front “notes approvingly the success of overseas Chinese candidates in elections in Toronto, Canada. In 2003, six were elected from 25 candidates but by
2006 the number jumped to 10 elected from among 44 candidates.”106 And the CCP does
not stop at observing a situation, it acts on it.

1. MPs and Ministers
The then-CSIS director, Richard Fadden, caused a commotion in 2010, the day before
president Hu Jintao was set to land in Ottawa for an official visit, when he deplored
that “there are several municipal politicians in British Columbia and in at least
two provinces there are ministers of the Crown who we think are under at least
the general influence of a foreign government.” He believed that they weren’t conscious of being used but, nonetheless, their close ties with the said-government ended
up “shifting their public policies” over the years.107 Fadden did not mention China but
his speech was largely interpreted as targeting Beijing implicitly, so much so that a parliamentary committee demanded that the government “apologize[s] to the Chinese
Canadian community.”108
In 2015, an article in The Globe and Mail disclosed that one of the ministers targeted by
Fadden five years earlier was Michael Chan, minister of Citizenship, Immigration, and
International Trade in Ontario.109 In response, the Canadian Chinese community organized a defense of the minister, with help from Beijing. Helen Wang, editor-in-chief of
the Chinese Canadian Post, reported that the Chinese consulate in Toronto pressured the
newspaper to publish more articles defending Chan. It also asked them to participate in
a press conference with the Confederation of Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations
(which president, Wei Chengyi, was none other than the newspaper’s owner) to demand
an apology from the Globe and Mail. But Helen Wang was eventually fired, and Michael
Chan invited to write a weekly column for the Chinese Canadian Post, a newspaper so
tightly aligned with the CCP that it was previously named the Red Army Post and printed
in Beijing.110 More recently, in August 2019, Chan intervened during a pro-Beijing event
and denounced the protests in Hong Kong. This event, as many others in Canada and in
Australia, was probably organized with some support from the CCP, and some participants were paid ($100) to attend.111

To seduce Canadian politicians, as with economic or intellectual figures, Beijing notoriously offers trips to China, all expenses paid. Local politicians are targeted, under
the pretext of exchanges between municipalities and for the development of commercial
relations between regions, but also members of parliament. Between 2006 and 2017,
MPs from the Senate and the Commons took a total of 36 trips to China. Many
of them were financed by the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA),
a United Front organization. On its own, the Liberal MP John McCallum took trips
worth CA$73,300 (€47,600) between 2008 and 2015, all paid by the Chinese government
or pro-Beijing groups such as the Canadian Confederation of Fujian Associations.112
McCallum later became minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (2015-2017)
and was appointed ambassador to China. As he was nominated, he stressed his proximity to the country, noting his wife’s Chinese roots and his electoral district, Markham,
in the suburbs of Toronto, which had a majority of electors of Chinese descent.113 In
Beijing, in January 2018, as he welcomed the Quebecois prime minister, ambassador
McCallum started a controversy when he declared that “in some important policy areas
such as the environment, global warming, free trade, globalization, the policies of the
government of Canada are closer to the policies of the government of China than they
are to U.S. policies.”114 Similarly, in January 2019, in the midst of the Huawei scandal,
ambassador McCallum started another controversy when he publicly opposed the extradition of Meng to the United States, providing Chinese media outlets with arguments
helping out the defense of Meng. Likewise, he endorsed a “deal” between the United
States and China to free the two Michaels (→ p. 546). Several days later, Prime Minister
Trudeau asked for, and received, his resignation.115 Chinese media outlets subsequently
criticized Trudeau’s decision, which the Global Times described as “political interference.”116 As James Palmer, who worked at the Global Times for seven years, explained,
China’s disappointment confirmed that its leaders “clearly saw McCallum as an asset,
as somebody who they very successfully wooed through this program.”117 It took
until September to announce a replacement, and the Canadian embassy in China was led
for seven months by a “mere” chargé d’affaires.
The previously mentioned figure of 36 trips to China between 2006 and 2017 only
accounts for the trips publicized by MPs, who are bound to disclose any trip paid for by a
third party – as with any gift. But Senator Victor Oh was sanctioned by the Office of the
Senate Ethics Officer because he had not disclosed a two-week trip to Beijing and to the
Chinese province of Fujian in April 2017.118 In December 2019, Senator Oh also attended
an event in Toronto celebrating the 70th anniversary of the PRC, and which was co-or-

The MP Vincent Ke
In 2018, Vincent Ke became the first immigrant from mainland China to be elected MP with
the Progressive Conservative Party and to seat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. His
past is not very well known (he refused to answer questions from the National Post when it
prepared a long profile on him121) except that he was born in Quanzhou (China), and that
he was a student “cadre” at Fuzhou University (according to Alex Joske, student “cadres”
“often act as informants to monitor students and lecturers for politically questionable
behavior”122). He later moved to Beijing and was selected as an “outstanding young person” by the Haidian District (a title that “would likely be administered by the Communist
Youth League and given to someone on a ‘fast track’ for party membership,” according to
Charles Burton).123 Ke later studied in Germany, at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum where
he “participated in the work of organizing the Ruhr region Chinese overseas students society”124 (which seemsto be the local CSSA → p. 280). In 1998, he immigrated to Canada
and settled in Ontario. Having to justify himself on his professional past, he declared that
he worked as an electronic engineer for the German company Conec (which had a factory
in Shanghai) between 1999 and 2018 in Brampton – even though the professional association of Ontario engineers couldn’t confirm it because he had never been registered.125 He
was, however, registered as an insurance salesman. In 2013, he was selected by the Chinese
consulate in Toronto to receive one week of training in China, the 14th Chinese Overseas

2. Municipal politicians
“Municipal politicians are often the prime target,” according to Stephanie Carvin, an
academic and former analyst at the CSIS.129 They are indeed more accessible and discrete targets. And there are occasions when many of them can be hooked at once, such
as during the annual convention of the Union of British Columbia Municipalities
(UBCM), that brings together 190 regional and municipal districts, as well as 8 First
Nations of British Columbia. In 2012, the Consul General in Vancouver, Liu Fei, decided
to organize an invitation-only reception during the event, which eventually became a
tradition – so much so that, some years, the consulate was not only a sponsor but the
main co-sponsor of the convention, along with the provincial government of British
Columbia.130 China was the only foreign government to sponsor the UBCM. That
said, it ended in 2019 as the Huawei scandal and the worsening of the bilateral relation made China less socially acceptable, and several mayors, including Brad West (Port
Coquitlam) condemned the sponsorship. In a letter to the UBCM executive members,
West explained, for instance, that collaborating with the PRC “brings the UBCM into
disrepute and reflects horribly on all members” because “the Government of China
is engaged in a number of actions that are hostile to our country’s interests and the
interests of every Canadian, and are completely at odds with our values, the rule of
law and the very principles that we were all elected to uphold.” He gave three exam126. Blackwell, “MPP’s ties to China.”

Consul General Liu Fei and executive members of the UBCM
at the consulate in Vancouver (26 Nov. 2018).133

For Jonathan Manthorpe, “the aim of the CCP’s diplomats is clearly to turn social
relationships with B.C. municipal officials and politicians into ones where the Canadians
feel a sense of obligation.”134 And some deliver quite well. For instance, Al Richmond,
a former regional president in British Columbia, who was UBCM vice-president in 2012,
became a friend to China. He actually acknowledged having grown closer to the Chinese
government over the years “with the goal of facilitating trade, tourism and business
connections” for his constituents.135 During the Covid-19 pandemic, in March 2020, he
told Xinhua that China was “successful in containing the virus” and that Ottawa could
learn a lot from Beijing. With its enormous global firepower, Xinhua catapulted this
otherwise unremarkable comment from an obscure local politician to the global stage.
In June 2019, in the midst of the Huawei case, Xinhua quoted the same Al Richmond
in an article untitled “Canadian small Internet suppliers like to use Huawei technology:
local official.”136
This CCP interest in local Canadian politics is now well known and has led to several testimonials, including that of Alan Harris, who recounted how, while running for
municipal office in Clarington, Ontario in 2018, he had been approached by the Canada
China Industry Promotion Association. This organization invited him to Xining, China,
to enhance their “friendship” but also to talk about investment and trade – a tempting
proposal for this rural, poorly connected municipality in need of infrastructure. This
time it didn’t work out because Harris was already aware of the dangers of Chinese influence. “I knew enough to ignore the email, but how many candidates across this country
replied?”137

B. Elections under influence
Electoral interference is harder in Canada strictly speaking than it was in Australia
and New Zealand before they adopted measures against it, and for two reasons. First, a
great deal of influence materializes through money, and Canada has adopted stricter regulations on contributions to political parties, with an $1,000 annual individual limit. Then,
the Chinese in Canada are not too interested in politics compared to other communities,
such as Indians, who are very politicized for they share an appetite for democracy with
Canadians. Now, that could change because Chinese newcomers in Canada are more politically active than their parents and grandparents.
That said, there are cases of Chinese electoral interference in Canada. In Australia,
like in Canada, this risk is inversely proportional to the level of education: elites are informed
and politically conscious but, locally, the working-class population is vulnerable. This is the
reason why Ottawa fears local elections more than parliamentary elections. In 2014,
Michel Juneau-Katsuya, a former head of the Asia-Pacific Office at the CSIS, noted that
“CSIS found evidence that the Chinese Consulate in Toronto was directly interfering
in elections, by sending Chinese students into the homes of Chinese-language-only households and telling residents which candidate the Consulate wanted voters to choose.”138
The Chinese embassy uses local media outlets, but also money, to support certain
candidates during local elections, hoping to rally Chinese communities on a pro-Beijing
platform. They target communities where the density of Chinese Canadians is important
enough to have an electoral impact, in the Richmond-Center district of Vancouver, for
instance, where more than half (54%) of the population has Chinese roots.139 Richmond
is the “most Chinese city in the world outside of Asia.”140 In this district, the Chinese
consulate is regularly accused of endorsing candidates with a Chinese background.
The Richmond-based Canada Wenzhou Friendship Society is an organization created in 2001, ostensibly to help newly-arrived Chinese migrants. It is also a member of the
Canadian Alliance of Chinese Associations, a platform of more than 100 associations with
the common objective of building a stronger Chinese-Canadian relationship (the group is
known to be tied to Chinese authorities). In October 2018, the Society drew attention when
it offered CAN$26,000 (€16,900) to eight candidates141 and encouraged voters – through its
WeChat group – to vote for specific candidates with a Chinese background in the districts
of Richmond, Vancouver and Burnaby, in exchange of a financial retribution – $20 offered
as a “transportation subsidy.”142

V. An Influence on Media Outlets
Beijing’s global takeover of Chinese-language media outlets – North America included – is
a problem that has been known for some time.144 Nowadays, nearly all Chinese-language
outlets in Canada are controlled by the CCP: all that remains for Chinese-Canadians
hoping to read information not censored by the CCP are Falun Gong-aligned outlets (the
newspaper The Epoch Times and the TV channel New Tang Dynasty (NTDTV)), which can’t
be described as models of professionalism.145 And both are restricted by Chinese (which,
for instance, cancelled the visas initially granted to their journalists covering the visit of PM
Paul Martin in China in 2005) and Canadian authorities, trying to avoid angering Beijing
(when Hu Jintao visited Ottawa in 2005, The Epoch Times and NTDTV were denied access
to the events; and during a second visit in 2010 as well).146
To model journalism in Chinese to its own image, the CCP uses its traditional tools:
the carrot (encouraging newspapers to censor themselves in exchange of business
benefits) and the stick (intimidating, threatening, harassing, pressuring relatives
in China, firing journalists who resist this pressure, or putting an end to programs
deemed dissident). The CCP also tries to supervise and train journalists, in Canada (a local
United Front organization based in Vancouver, the International New Media Cooperation
Organization (国际新媒体合作组织), convened pro-Beijing Chinese-language outlets
from North America in 2014)147 or in China (numerous Canadian outlets participated in the

Canadian Times (加中时报), and New Start Times (星星文化传媒集团)) attended a training
in Beijing with 88 media in Chinese from thirty countries, once again led by Tan Tianxing.149

Journalists who do not play by the rules are systematically dismissed. For example, the Vancouver journalist Huang Hebian (黄河边) (his real name is Gao Bingchen)
was a columnist for one of the most widely-circulated Chinese-language Canadian newspapers, the Burnaby-based Global Chinese Press (British Columbia), for over a decade. But,
after Huang published two critical messages on a personal social media account in June
2016, one targeting Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, the other Ontario
minister Michael Chan, the newspaper was pressured into firing Huang.152 In 2017, its
editor-in-chief, Lei Jin, was also fired because he wrote, and tried to publish, an obituary
of the academic, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize Liu Xiaobo, who died in
a Chinese jail.153 Another example: Kenneth Yau, host of the Chinese-language station
Fairchild Radio in Ontario, was fired in October 2019 for being too critical of China: the
week before, he had asked a guest how he could be “100% Canadian” and respect the
CCP at the same time. The station received numerous complaints from pro-China listen-

ers.154 A month before, a host of Fairchild Radio in Vancouver, Anita Lee, had already
been into trouble after playing the Hong Kong protesters’ anthem on the air (“Glory to
Hong Kong”). Several days later, she announced that she was taking a break, supposedly
because her son was entering school – which did not convince anyone.155 Then, her show
was officially cancelled in May 2020.
The fact that almost all Chinese-language media are controlled by the CCP means that
Chinese immigrants who speak little or no English or French have relatively little exposure to democratic and liberal values and are therefore unlikely to change: many of them,
“even though they have lived in Canada for many years, still have the same communist
mentality.”156
Furthermore, there are cases of information manipulation, including doctored
translations. For instance, the Sing Tao (星島), a daily Chinese-language Canadian newspaper jointly owned by the Hong Kong-based Sing Tao News Corporation and the
Canadian media group Torstar Corporation (owner of the Toronto Star, the most widely
circulated newspaper in the country) had a deal to translate and publish articles from
the Toronto Star. But, on several occasions, it became clear that the Sing Tao doctored
the articles it took up “to conform with the CCP’s view of the world.” In 2008,
for example, articles on Tibet “bore very little relation to the original Toronto Star stories,
which contained vehement criticism of Beijing.”157 Another example: the Vancouver Sun
launched its Chinese version in 2012, named Taiyangbao. But those reading the newspaper in both its English and Chinese versions quickly called out the differences between
them. It appeared that the translators, provided by the consulate, were also censors that cleaned the Chinese version from everything they deemed unacceptable.
Hence, the Vancouver Sun found new translators but, within hours, the readership of the
Taiyangbao website dropped spectacularly: Beijing had decided to block access to it from
China.158

A case of doxing
On October 28, 2018, Beijing published a wanted notice for an economic fugitive, Cui
Xuewen (崔学文) – who is also a Canadian resident – in a Canadian subsidiary of the Hong
Kong-based newspaper Ming Pao. According to Canadian officials we met, this was the first
known case of doxing (i.e. it disclosed private information about an individual to harm them
→ p. 397). Until then, efforts to arrest fugitives had been more discrete and kept away from
the public. The announcement highlights how unlikely Cui is to avoid being found by authorities, both in Canada (when his official documents lapse) and China. He was targeted by
an official program set up by the Central Committee to catch state officials suspected of a
crime who have fled abroad.

VI. An Influence on Education
A. At the university
Canada has always been a prime destination for Chinese students. In 2015, out of the
523,700 Chinese studying abroad, 119,335 (nearly 23%) were in Canada.159 Two years later,
there were already more than 140,000 Chinese students in Canadian universities, according to the Canadian Bureau for International Education160 – including 10,000 at the sole
University of Toronto. And the restrictions implemented by U.S. universities made Canada
even more attractive. The problem is that, in Canada as elsewhere in the world, some of
these students are working for Beijing (→ p. 273).
In a speech to the presidents of the 15 largest Canadian universities (U15) in April
2018, CSIS director David Vigneault declared that “CSIS assesses that China represents
the most significant and clear challenge for (human-enabled espionage) targeted
against Canada’s universities,” because Chinese services actively “monitor and influence” students and teachers. Hence, students and researchers are “non-traditional collectors” of information for Beijing inasmuch as they “have little-to-no formal intelligence
tradecraft training but are often in a position to acquire vast quantities of data or knowledge.”161
Two types of problems should be considered separately: first, Beijing targets
Canadian universities specialized in sciences and technology to spy and steal
technologies, using not only students, but also researchers, teachers, and collaborations between Canadian and Chinese laboratories. In at least nine Canadian universities,
Canadian academics have taken part to dozens of research projects with Chinese
military researchers, on topics ranging from satellite imagery or secured communications
to drones. In some cases, Chinese researchers revealed their military affiliation (because
they were tied to military universities such as Zhengzhou, the Changsha University of
Science and Technology, or Xi’an Jiaotong University). In other cases, however, they hid
it, pretending to be affiliated to institutions that, in some cases, do not even exist,
such as the “Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute,” a cover used in at
least 1,300 scientific articles, according to Alex Joske. He noted that this cover was used by
PLA researchers to travel abroad and, for one of them, to work at McMaster University, in
Canada.162 Between 2006 and 2018, at least 687 scientific articles were jointly published by
Canadians and Chinese military researchers. As in the Australian case, which is very similar,
it raises the problematic question of knowing to what extent “Canada inadvertently
helps China modernizing its armed forces”163 (→ p. 295).
Second, Beijing also uses Canadian universities to political ends: to control what
is said on China (content of conferences, lists of speakers) and to monitor dissidents
who are invited to speak. In that case, Chinese students are the main actors.

long-standing ties, sometimes going back several decades, is changing: five or ten years
ago, China was the largest source of foreign students and was seen as an opportunity. For
the past five years or so, universities have been concerned that Chinese students are very
(too) numerous, that they largely live among themselves, do not participate in university
life, do not integrate, and too often mobilize to defend the interests of Beijing. So there is
a growing awareness of the problem. During the annual meeting of the U15, in 2019,
one session was dedicated to it and their unanimously acknowledged the risk raised by
Chinese influence in Canadian universities.

Evidence of the embassy’s intervention in student demonstrations
In 2010, as they prepared for the upcoming visit of President Hu Jintao in Ottawa, about fifty
Chinese students who had received scholarships from the Chinese government to study in
Canadian universities were invited at the embassy. Liu Shaohua, the first secretary for education, gave a speech that was clandestinely recorded by the Epoch Times164 and in which he explained that the embassy would bring 3,000 persons to Ottawa from Ontario, but also Quebec,
all expenses paid (hotel, food, transportation, even clothes), so as to organize a welcome party
for the president. Some testimonies also mentioned a CA$50 daily compensation. He presented the visit as a “political struggle” to defend “the reputation of our motherland” against the
“Falun Gong, Tibetan separatists, Uyghur separatists, democracy people [who] have already
moved onto Parliament Hill.”
After reminding students that their expenses would be covered, even those without a scholarship, Liu asked them not to “talk about it outside […] to anyone.” He told them of the importance of being numerous because, during the visit of President Hu Jintao in 2005, opponents
dominated and Chinese officials were furious. Hence, they needed to organize a better welcome
party this time. Then, in case someone asked them why they were there, Liu explained that
they should respond that “We are here to welcome President Hu. Long live the Canada-China
friendship.” That same day, Zhang Baojun, in charge of education at the Chinese Consulate
in Toronto, delivered the same message, by email: she demanded that students “comply with
the plan and act in unity.” Students with a scholarship who faced “exceptional difficulties that
prevent[ed] them from participating,” were required to “provide an explanation.”

Chinese students do not hide their nationalism on Canadian campuses: they are organized in associations with a near-military discipline, sometimes raising the Chinese
flag and singing the Chinese national anthem on university campuses of British
Columbia for instance. Some act as de facto representatives of Beijing: they play a role in
monitoring and, if necessary, intimidating students and faculty members on matters tied
to China. They also regularly organize demonstrations to defend Beijing’s interests (see
examples below).
This raises another question: is it possible to demonstrate that Chinese authorities in
Canada (embassy and consulates) effectively mobilize Chinese students, which would
constitute a proven case of foreign interference? In Canada, as in other countries where
the mobilization of Chinese students is a problem (i.e. in Australia and New Zealand), the
link is hard to establish, either because Chinese authorities exercise a very discrete
control, or because they do not need to be involved as the constraint is internalized:
164. Jason Loftus, “Tape Reveals Embassy Footing Bill for Hu Jintao’s Welcome Rally,” The Epoch Times (23 Jun.
2010), (for all the quotes in the paragraph).

568

students, who arrive indoctrinated, indebted (scholarships), and worried about their future
in China and about what might happen to their families, are spontaneously zealous. Most
of the time, it is impossible to show an interference and, in a democratic context in which
freedom of expression is protected, the universities and host countries can’t stop these
mobilizations.

1. The Role of CSSAs
The global role of CSSAs was introduced in Part Three (→ p. 280) but Canada provides
additional examples. There are indeed many testimonies of students being pressured
by a CSSA to dissuade them from doing this, or on the contrary to incite them to
do that. For example, a student at the University of Ottawa received a threatening e-mail
from the CSSA of her university: “according to reports from some other students and
the investigation done by the association’s cadre,” the message read, “you are still a Falun
Gong practitioner. Watch out.”165 At the University of Calgary, CSSA members received
en email from someone presenting themselves as an agent of the Chinese Public Security
Bureau, instructing them not to attend a movie projection organized by the Friends of
Falun Gong club, “otherwise your name and photo will be submitted to the Central government.”166
The CSSAs’ rhetoric often shows that they are merely proxies for Chinese authorities.
When the CSSA of the University of Toronto lobbied the municipality not to recognize a
Falun Gong Day in 2004, or the University of Ottawa’s intervened to block the TV channel NTDTV, in 2005, they used exactly the same sentences, the same expressions in
their messages as Chinese diplomats do in their letters of protest.167
The CSIS confirmed the control exerted by Chinese authorities over CSSAs in Canadian
universities. In certain cases, it labeled their activities as espionage. This was the case
of Yong Jie Qu for instance, a Chinese student who registered at Concordia University in
1991, took part to the activities of the university’s CSSA the following years, and applied for
permanent residency in Canada in 1994.168 His application was transferred to CSIS which
denied it because, as explained in his rejection letter:
There were reasonable grounds to believe that you had engaged in acts of espionage and subversion
against democratic institutions […]. By your own admission […] you had communicated repeatedly
with the PRC Embassy in Ottawa, provided information on the activities of members of a Canadian
student organization [the CSSA] and attempted to corrupt that organization to meet the goals and
objectives of a foreign government. […] you readily acknowledged your numerous contacts with
Chinese diplomats over an extended period of time during which you helped “reorganize” the CSSA.
You also acknowledged that you provided information to Chinese diplomats about certain members
of the CSSA and that you openly disagreed with the pro-democracy students in the organization,
identified these students and reported them to the embassy, and sought to change the direction of
the CSSA using funds provided by the embassy to support certain activities, to make it “responsive
to the Chinese government and Chinese officials.”169

A more recent example helped to establish a link between a university’s CSSA
and Chinese authorities: Rukiye Turdush, a Uyghur Canadian activist, gave a talk
at McMaster University in February 2019. The discussion between Chinese students in
a WeChat group as they anticipated the conference, showed that they had warned the
embassy which, in return, asked them to verify whether university leaders attended, to
take pictures of the conference and send them to Chinese officials. A Chinese student
filmed it and, as he questioned the speaker, insulted her before leaving the room. The
coordination among Chinese students and with Chinese diplomats is visible on
the screenshots of the WeChat group they had created for the occasion (see below,
on the left). We also know that the Chinese consulate in Toronto asked whether Chinese
citizens had taken part to the organization of the conference (on the right).

The following day, the university’s CSSA released a statement
denouncing the conference as an invitation to racial hatred
and separatism, and asking the university to ensure that in the
future “the dignity” of Chinese students is not violated.
Suspected of having intervened because the message was
written in the usual style of official CCP communiqués, the
embassy denied it while considering the students’ approach
“just and patriotic.”172 The Washington Post, which copied and
translated the WeChat messages, noted that it was “unusual
to find written evidence of apparent coordination with
[Chinese] officials.”173 David Mulroney, the former Canadian

ambassador to China added that “the fact they want to know which academics attend hints
at desire to stop academic freedom.”174
On February 16, the embassy released a statement affirming that “what happened
recently at the University of Toronto [see below] and McMaster University has nothing
to do with the Chinese Embassy and Chinese Consulate General in Canada” but also that
(in the following sentence) “we strongly support the just and patriotic actions of Chinese
students.”175
Acting on a demand from other students, some of whom found “extraordinarily
terrifying […] to know that an organization – in its capacity as an [student union]-ratified club – reported activity on campus to the Chinese government,” the CSSA was
finally dissolved on September 2019, with 22 student representatives out of 35 voting
in favor.176
Another interesting case occurred at the same time, on the Scarborough campus
of the University of Toronto: that of Chemi Lhamo, a 22-year-old Canadian student
of Tibetan origin. In February 2019, as she had recently been elected president of a
students’ association, she was targeted by a pro-Beijing and anti-Tibetan hatred
campaign. An Instagram picture of her was the object of thousands of heinous
and threatening comments such as “China is your daddy – you better know this,” or
“Ur not gonna be the president of UTSC […] Even if you do, we will make sure things
get done so u won’t survive a day. Peace RIP.” A petition demanding her resignation,
and promoted by the CCP’s English newspaper Global Times,177 received almost 10,000
signatures. A message also circulated on WeChat asking Chinese students to do everything they could to prevent the student association from being “controlled by Tibetan
separatists.”178
Michel Juneau-Katsuya believed that “it [was] beyond plausible” that the Chinese government was involved in the campaign: “It is their strategy to try to undermine, to try to
mute any form of opposition or dissidence that could at one point or another gain access
to a mic.”179
Chinese authorities do not always wait and use students as proxies: they sometimes intervene directly. For instance, the day before a conference with the president
of the World Uyghur Congress, Dolkun Isa, at Montreal’s Concordia University, in
March 2019, the organizer, Kyle Matthews, who headed the Montreal Institute for
Genocide and Human Rights Studies, received en email from Consul General Xing
Wenjian asking for an “urgent meeting” to which he did not answer. The consulate
also contacted Montreal officials to try to cancel the event.180 But it was not met with
success.

B. In Secondary schools
Chinese influence is not limited to higher education: High schools are also
affected, not only by the problem of aggressive counter-demonstrations, harassment
and intimidation of student human rights activists (there have been several incidents,
with torn down posters, anonymous letters, etc., in high and secondary schools across
the country, particularly in British Columbia).181 Controls and censorship over academic
content is also a problem. And, once again, Confucius Institutes (CIs) are blamed
(→ p. 299) because the 13 Canadian institutes are “typically affiliated with postsecondary
education institutes and K-12 schools.”182 The first Canadian CI opened at the British
Columbia Institute of Technology in 2006. In February 2009, there were at least five
others: in Edmonton (Alberta School for the Deaf), Waterloo (University of Waterloo –
twinned to Nanjing University), Moncton (Atlantic Education International), Montreal
(Dawson College) and Sherbrooke (Université de Sherbrooke).183 And they sometimes
received official support: “the Quebecois Ministry of Education granted CA$65,000
[42,230 euros] for the launch of Confucius Institutes in Quebec during the 2007-2008
academic year.”184
In 2019, the New Brunswick Ministry of Education cancelled the contracts that tied
the CIs to two dozen middle schools in the province after parents complained about
restrictions on the freedom of expression of the pupils on topics related to China.
Some teachers, for instance, forbade any discussion of the Tian’anmen massacre and used maps that integrated Taiwan into China. The minister acknowledged that the “school system [was] being used [by Beijing] as a conduit for extending
[its] influence.”185 Before that, several universities (McMaster, McGill, Manitoba, and
Sherbrooke) had done the same, or altogether refused to host a CI for these reasons
(censorship or a control by the Chinese government that was seen as incompatible with
academic freedom and so on).
In October 2019, in a Chinese language course at a Richmond high school, in British
Columbia, the fifteen-year-old pupils were shown a propaganda film untitled My
People, My Country (2019) on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the PRC,
and were tested with a questionnaire untitled “I love my country.” The questionnaire was politically oriented, with questions such as “which words, or sentences from
the movie made you feel good?” Following the ensuing controversy, the test was
cancelled.186

Questionnaire on the propaganda film My People, My Country
that was shown to Richmond students.
The Chinese title, at the top of the sheet, was

is more neutral because it could be translated
as “Me and my country”).187

Even young children are targeted: in October 2018, for instance, a Nishan
Bookstore (尼山书屋, see below) opened at the Richmond Public Library, in
Vancouver,188 and targeted children with its “China Tales” book collection. One watchful observer noted on Twitter “the Nishan House’s stated propaganda mission: Inviting
foreigners to tell China’s story to other foreigners (请外国人讲中国故事给外国人看).
In this new decentralized strategy, CCP propaganda targets our children, spread through
Nishan’s books instead of a central Confucius Institute. In other words, local politicians have welcomed the CCP’s Propaganda Department to publish propaganda
kids’ books here in Vancouver.”189

The Nishan Bookstores
More than thirty Nishan bookstores (尼山书屋) have been created in two dozen countries
since 2013.191 They are overseen by the Jinan-based Shandong Friendship Publishing House
(山东友谊出版社), created in 1986 in the administrative center of Shandong. This publishing house produces content to introduce foreign publics to the Chinese culture,192 a form of
“external propaganda” (对外宣 传).193 The company is owned by the Shandong Publication
Group Co., Ltd (山东出版集团),194 an entity financed by the Financial Bureau of Shandong
(山东省财政厅).195
The Nishan bookstores – from the name of the mountain where Confucius was presumably
born – are the overseas editors of the publishing house, tasked with promoting cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.196 It began with two bookstores in China in
2012, at the Confucius Research Institute (曲阜孔子研究院) and at the Nishan Shengyuan
Academy (尼山圣源书 院).197 Then, three dozen foreign antennas have opened since 2013,
including in Valletta, Moscow, Warsaw, Auckland, Macerata, Buenos Aires, Canberra, Gdansk,
New York or Los Angeles.198 After 2018, others were opened at the Richmond Public Library,
in Vancouver,199 at the Confucius Institute of Eötvös Loránd University, in Budapest,200 at the
Confucius Institute in Dusseldorf,201 in Dubai,202 and in Kampala, at the Confucius Institute
of Makerere University.203

VIII. The Manipulation of Information
A. The fake letters from the Prime Minister and the Minister of
Immigration
On April 20, 2019, the Tibetan Association of Canada (TAC) was inaugurated in Toronto,
the latest member of the Confederation of Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations
(CTCCO), an umbrella platform of more than 90 organizations with ties to the Chinese
consulate. It quickly became evident that the TAC was a façade allowing Beijing to circulate
its narrative on Tibet. Tibetan people were in the minority at the inauguration, and all were
known for their prior ties to the local United Front department and/or to the Chinese con191. “Introduction,” Shandong Friendship Publishing House (https://archive.vn/eYGzH); “Shandong Opens

sulate. The Chinese national anthem was played, and the director of the new association
thanked Beijing for the economic development of Tibet. The creation of this group was
immediately denounced by other Tibetan associations in Canada which highlighted that
the TAC wasn’t representative and that its creation was certainly motivated by a desire “to
divide the Tibetan community in Canada.”204
At that precise moment, two letters of endorsement apparently written by Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau, and his minister of Immigration Ahmed Hussen – both
rough counterfeits with grammar mistakes – circulated on Facebook and Twitter.
Several days later, a spokesman for the Prime Minister Office confirmed that the letters had
been fabricated. In response, the TAC declared that it had nothing to do with the operation. But, for Jonathan Manthorpe, “this [was] clearly a United Front operation.”205 Other
sources suggested that it might not have been China but another country, to “add fuel to
the fire” of bilateral tensions.

B. WeChat’s role
The Chinese phone messaging app WeChat (→ p. 196) is increasingly used in Canada,
and not solely by the Chinese community: politicians, for instance, are growing more accustomed to using it in Canada, as in the United States, to reach Chinese-speaking voters.
As noted earlier, WeChat seems systematically used when organizing pro-Beijing
counter-demonstrations in reaction to events linked to the “five poisons.” Another problem arises from this: Beijing is permanently censoring content on the app: discussions are monitored and, sometimes, doctored. A professor at a Canadian university shared

with us that he had noticed, in a closed discussion group of Chinese-speaking students,
researchers and teachers at the university, that messages, and sometimes entire discussions,
often disappeared. This was also noted by Freedom House: “in Canada, WeChat censors
deleted a Member of Parliament’s message to constituents praising Hong Kong’s Umbrella
Movement protesters, manipulated dissemination of news reports related to Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou’s arrest, and blocked broader media coverage of Chinese government
corruption and leading Chinese officials.”206 Beyond intervening on the content, Chinese
intelligence uses overseas WeChat groups to detect dissidents and gather personal
data.
Finally, a scandal forced the prime minister to intervene: the
WeChat account of a Liberal minister was used, without
her knowledge, to raise funds to finance the legal proceedings against a journalist critical of Beijing. On April
30, 2020, the journalist Sam Cooper published on globalnews.
ca an article showing that in mid-January, while China was
concealing the extent of the coronavirus epidemic that hit it,
it mobilized its relays around the world to acquire and stockpile a gigantic number of personal protective equipment (2.5
billion in six weeks) such as masks, that consulates in Canada
relayed these calls and that groups linked to the United Front
bought and sent to China a large number of these items –
which a few weeks and months later would be sold at a high
price by China to the whole world.207 Several members of the
Chinese Canadian community considered the possibility of a
class action lawsuit against the journalist and the newspaper.208
To that end, a person called Maria Xu, a member of Joyce
Murray’s WeChat group – Vancouver’s Liberal MP, president of the Treasury Board and
Minister of Digital Government in the Trudeau Cabinet – published a message in the
group with a link to a website collecting donations to fund this lawsuit. Once it was detected,
the message was deleted and Maria Xu excluded from the WeChat group. At that point, the
prime minister intervened to denounce the attacks against the journalist as “absolutely
unacceptable” and Murray’s office explained that WeChat was “used to engage members of
the Chinese Canadian community” and that “this particular post was unacceptable and in
no way reflects the Minister’s views. Participation in this group is guided by posted guidelines and a disclaimer. In this case, guidelines were not followed and the individual who
posted is no longer in this group.” In turn, Global News explained that it was “increasingly
concerned by what appears to be an organized effort to discredit our journalist, our reporting and our news division as we investigate the serious issue of foreign influence in Canadian
affairs.”209

VIII. A Myriad of Local Organizations as Relays
In Canada, and particularly in Vancouver and Toronto, there are many Chinese associations, organizations and groups. Some are old, such as the Chinese Benevolent
Association of Vancouver (1896), the Canada-China Friendship Society in Ottawa (1976)
and the Federation of Canada-China Friendship Associations (1980). And all of them are
more or less linked to the UFWD, hence to the CCP. The groups “promoting the
pacific reunification of China,” directly affiliated to the UFWD, are the easiest to uncover.
For instance, three Vancouver groups belong to that category: the China Unification
Promotion Council (CANADA) (加拿大中国统一促进会), created in 1999; the Canada
Chinese Peaceful and Unification Association (加拿大中国和平统一促 进会), created in 2003 to help newly arrived migrants, and the president of which, Wang Dianqi (王
典奇), made a name for himself after he convinced a city councilor to raise the Chinese
flag in front of the Vancouver city hall while wearing a red scarf (which is largely
interpreted in the Chinese Canadian community as a symbol of loyalty to the Communist
regime) on the occasion of the 67th anniversary of the PRC210; last but not least, the North
America China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification (北美
温 哥华中国和平统一促进会), created in 2016.

The 2019 Hong Kong crisis made it easier to clarify, where it was still necessary, how
a large number of Chinese associations in Canada position themselves toward Beijing. A
statement released by the Chinese Benevolent Association of Vancouver in June
2019, and signed by 208 associations, adopted the CCP’s rhetoric almost to the
word212:

As ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese people residing in Canada, we are all the children of Emperor
Yan and Emperor Huang [two of China’s mythic founders], we belong to the same Chinese nation,
based on the idea of blood being thicker than water, patriotism and love of our homeland, we
are paying a close attention to the development of the current Hong Kong situation, we are obliged
to unite with the Hong Kong residents and not to be taken advantage of by the separatist forces.213

The list, which was very usefully translated in English,214 gives an overview (probably
non-exhaustive) of the reach of Chinese influence in the non-profit sector tied to
Chinese Canadian communities. Among the 208 groups, at least 80 had apparently
recently been created, “reflecting the huge surge in mainland Chinese migration since about
2000.”215 If many of the signatories have established ties to the Chinese government,
a few elements made some observers believe that the letter was guided by Chinese authorities, including sentences presenting Hong Kong as “an internal affair of China,” opposing “the interference of any foreign forces,” and an endorsement of ethnic nationalism
(Chinese Canadians are “all the children of Emperor Yan and Emperor Huang [two of
China’s mythic founders],” their “blood being thicker than water”)216 that we mentioned in
the section dedicated to the diasporas (→ p. 165).
This proliferation of groups made of a multitude of subgroups is a “kind of United
Front tactic,” according to Fenella Sung of the Canadian Friends of Hong Kong: “it’s
very easy to form a community group. You do not even have to register. If you’re not
incorporated, you can just get together [even] two or three people … and form a group.”
In other words, “it’s really bluffing more than anything. They want to show they are
stronger and have more people than they really have.”217 Cheuk Kwan, of the Toronto
Association for Democracy in China added that “these are basically fake organizations.”
“They are what I call the mouthpieces of the Chinese consulate. This is a very clearly
United Front effort by the Chinese government.”218
A similar operation was organized globally in August 2019: a statement signed by 583
Chinese organizations worldwide was circulated by the Chinese embassy in Ottawa,219
which advertised the involvement of 204 Chinese organizations from Canada.220 Another
example took place in October 2019 with an ad in the Chinese Canadian Times bought by
the Council of Newcomer Organizations, a self-described apolitical association subsidized
by the Canadian government – a detail that caused a public uproar (the spokesperson of
Canadian Friends of Hong Kong condemned “our government” for “using taxpayers’
money to enable CCP influence and infiltration into our society and politics”).221

The Transformation of S.U.C.C.E.S.S.
The United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (S.U.C.C.E.S.S.) is an organization based in Vancouver that provides social services to Chinese immigrants. Created in
1973, it is one of the largest social services agencies in the country, helping more than 60,000
persons on a budget of CA$50 million (€32.5 million) granted by the government. For years,
S.U.C.C.E.S.S. used to denounce the Tian’anmen massacre by signing a joint statement with
other organizations on the day of the commemoration of the bloody repression. In 2019,
however, on the 30th anniversary of the event, the organization kept silent – which did not go
unnoticed.222 But the demographics had changed: more than 40% of its “clients” now come
from mainland China, and no longer from Hong Kong.
In recent years, S.U.C.C.E.S.S. apparently turned its back: in 2015, the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Office (→ p. 69) labeled it an “Overseas Chinese Service Centre” (OCSC). As Matt
Schrader showed with one Toronto-based OCSC, there are proven ties between the centers
and the CCP (the Toronto center sent a New Year’s card “on behalf of the Consul General
of the PRC” that included praise for the 19th CCP Congress and, the year before, hosted
a welcome banquet for the new consul general during which Lin Xingyong, the president
of the Confederation of Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations, declared that “[We
will] give Consul He our strongest support and cooperation”).223 The decision to label
S.U.C.C.E.S.S. an OCSC wasn’t anodyne. In fact, the agency also opened an office in Beijing
and its members are increasingly parading with diplomats from the Chinese consulate and
other pro-Beijing communitarian groups. As such, many of those who had known and
respected the work of this agency in previous decades are now surprised and disappointed
by this evolution.
The Australian precedent is interesting here: the equivalent of S.U.C.C.E.S.S. in Australia, the
Chinese Australian Services Society, based in Sidney, was also labeled an OCSC.224 As a consequence perhaps, it started to get involved in foreign policy matters in 2017, with a paper
suggesting that Australia should reconsider its “strategic alignment with the United States” and
develop its relations with China instead.

In March 2019, three Canadian representatives of local organizations were in
Beijing as delegates to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC): Chen Yongtao (陈永涛), president of the Vancouver-based Canadian Alliance
of Chinese Associations, Wang Linan (王立楠), president of the Canada Shandong
General Chamber of Commerce, also in Vancouver, and Lin Xingyong (林性勇), president of the Confederation of Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations.226 Ling Yin,
the publisher of Sept Days, a weekly Chinese-language newspaper based in Montreal,
also attended. In an interview for the website Chinaqw.com, he explained that the role
of overseas Chinese (like him) was to “tell the history of China” to foreign readers and
governments.227 When, later that same month, Zhang Yunbo, president of the Torontobased Greater Northwest China Federation of Entrepreneurial Businesses in Canada,
was also in China for an event in the Shaanxi province, he granted an interview to a
government website in which he said that “to expand abroad, we need to be able to tell
a good story about China.”228

Each year, new organizations are created. Between October and December 2018,
for instance, the Federation of Transoceanic Chinese Canadian Association (FTCCA),
in Toronto, was created to “strengthen economic relations between Canada and China”;
its members “will have the opportunity to participate and experience exclusive visits
and tours to China.”230 The logo of the FTCCA actually resembles that of the All-China
Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (ACFROC), a major United Front organizations.

The organization’s inaugural event, in October 2018, gave an opportunity to United
Front agents from the consulate (Yang Baohua (杨葆华) and Li Sining (李斯宁)) to be in

Meanwhile, in Vancouver, Wang Dianqi (王典奇), who was already “simultaneously head
of three CCP United Front groups”232 in the city, formally created a fourth, the Chinese
Cultural Harmony and Unity Society of Canada, ostensibly to “study and spread a specific
facet of Xi Jinping thought (和合文化).” In reality, Hu Qiquan (胡启全), the consular
attaché in charge of political warfare, took part to the initial activities of the new organization and, soon after, Wang Dianqi travelled to China with the local politician Al Richmond
(→ p. 561), where he met with United Front agents.233

A public holiday to commemorate the Nanjing massacre
In October 2017, the legislative assembly of Ontario adopted a motion introduced by MP Soo
Wong (she was born in Hong Kong and moved to Canada at eight) that designated December
13 as a day of commemoration for the Nanjing massacre. In 2018, several organizations235
took part to a campaign to convince the federal government to create a public holiday to commemorate it. It was relayed by Jenny Kwan, a New Democratic Party MP who represents East
Vancouver in the Canadian parliament. Her speech, in July 2018, stirred a controversy; and
Japanese and Japanese Canadians, among others, protested. She has not been met with success
for now. Nonetheless, several months later, in October 2018, Kwan inaugurated a monument
dedicated to the victims of the Nanjing massacre, in the Richmond Hill neighborhood of
Toronto – the first outside of China – with two organizations (Confederation of Toronto
Chinese Canadian Organizations and Chinese Freemasons of Canada (Toronto)).

In August 2018, the creation of an association of PLA veterans residing in Canada,
the Canada Chinese Veteran’s Society, led to protests. Sherman Lai, himself a PLA veteran
(lieutenant-colonel) teaching at the royal military college in Kingston, Ontario, held that
“they took advantage of democracy, of the Canadian system … But communism, the PLA
is not compatible with democracy and the rule of law. Before their nostalgia, there is a very
bloody history,” including the intervention of Canadian troops during the Korean War.237
Others called out the PLA for its role in state repression, from Tian’anmen to Hong Kong
demonstrations, without forgetting Tibet and Xinjiang for instance. The association, which
organized events, created a choir called “Companions in arms,” for instance, which
performed in military uniforms and sang military patriotic songs during a festival
in Richmond (British Columbia) in October 2019 (see image below). The association had
apparently disbanded in June 2020.238

IX. Seducing First Nations
Chinese authorities in Canada are engaged in a strategy of seduction of First Nations
that could be used to divide the Canadian society. They play on the proximity between
Chinese immigrants and First Nations, which both assert they are victims of discriminations in Canada.
This can be done in subtle ways, as with the Musqueam, an Aboriginal population
in the Vancouver area. Some of them have Chinese ancestry because, from the early 20th
century to the 1970s, Chinese migrants from Guangdong lived and worked on farms on
the reserve and had children with Musqueam women. Two documentaries – Peeking into the
Pink Houses at Musqueam: A Migration Story (a short movie by Sarah Ling, 2015) and All Our
Father’s Relations (a feature film by Alejandro Yoshizawa, 2016) – tell the story of one of
these mixed families, the Grants, brothers and sisters who shared a Chinese father and a
Musqueam mother.
The synopsis of the second film announced to the viewers that, “as far back as the 19th
century, relations between Chinese and First Nations in Canada were often respectful and
mutually beneficial; both peoples supported one another in the face of marginalization
and racism.”239 This bilingual production, in English and Chinese, recorded the family when
they travelled to China in 2013 and first visited the village in the Guangdong province that

their father had left almost a century before. The trip was financed by the Chinese consulate
in Vancouver, which also provided translators for two days. In February 2015, Consul General
Liu Fei also “presented a cheque to Howard Grant [one of the Musqueam brothers of Chinese
origin] in support of the Musqueam-Chinese history project at the UBC Longhouse.”240

BC.243 At the ceremony where the grant was announced, Consul General Liu Fei declared

Chinese who faced hard labor and lack of rights in this land.”244

The history of the Grant family is endearing, and there is no doubting the sincerity of
anyone, including at the Chinese consulate. But this example pertains to a larger strategy of
seducing First Nations. The Musqueam case is specific because some are considered “almost Chinese.” In August 2016, the consul general organized a meeting between
Musqueam individuals and Sino-Canadian entrepreneurs.247 In 2019, the joint international
MBA program of the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Jiao-tong University, in
Shanghai, sent some Chinese students spend two weeks in Vancouver. In fact, since 2019,
an “introduction to the heritage of the Musqueam autochthone nation” was added to their
curriculum, during which Larry Grand tells them his personal history.248
The consulate has not forgotten the other communities. In December 2015, the consul general Liu Fei
met Grand Chief Edward John249 of the Tl’azt’en
Nation. He is one of Canada’s main autochthonous
political leaders and married to a former Musqueam
chief. The Secwepemc are also wooed, especially Mike
Archie, the former Secwepemc chief in Canim Lake
(BC). In late January 2019, he was invited to China by
the CPAFFC (Chinese People’s Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries), first to Hefei, to danse at “The Belt and Road World
Dance Conference,” and then to Beijing. The objective was to show a particular proximity
between Canadian First Nations and China, as made evident by the media coverage of Mike
Archie’s trip, which stated that “we established a friendship with Chinese people from
China who participated in mining gold panning and building railways more than
160 years ago” (which implied that they were both exploited by English Canadians), and
that “the visit showed how the BRI brings together world cultures,” with many pictures to
support that idea.250

The Canadian sanctions against the PRC adopted in March 2021, in response to
serious and systematic human rights abuses in Xinjiang, provided Beijing with an
opportunity to capitalize on the parallelism between the Chinese and First Nations.

In a long list of crimes committed by the very people who are giving lessons today (in
this case European, British and Canadian people, who announced sanctions in a coordinated fashion on March 22, 2021), the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs recalled that, in the 1870s, the Canadian government had implemented a policy of
“assimilation of indigenous people” and of “cultural genocide.”251 This way of turning
the accusation around, a Tu quoque (you too) fallacy, is not new: a month earlier, on
Twitter, she already stated that the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang were a lie, but that
“genocide did take place in Canada.”

Moreover, since one of the human rights abuses Beijing is accused of in Xinjiang is
the forced sterilization of Uyghur women, the adoption by the Canadian Parliament
of a motion condemning the PRC on February 22 also sparked controversy in Canada.
Indigenous advocacy groups accused the federal government of having implemented similar measures against them in the past. Of course, these groups did not
need Beijing to draw the parallel and express public outrage, but one can assume that their
mobilization was seen at the Chinese embassy in Ottawa not only as an opportunity to fan
the flames of this anger, but also as another reason to maintain close relations with
indigenous communities.

X. The Canadian case illustrates the russification of Chinese
influence operations
The preceding pages show that, as Charles Burton said, “there are strong circumstantial indications that Chinese influence operations have been notably successful in
Canada,”252 but also that, not unlike what happened in Sweden, we can see the early
stages of a Russification of these influence operations. Indeed, in Canada, Beijing

la RPC au Canada, 24 mars 2021 (https://archive.vn/wIqQW).

does not stop at modeling the national debate on China, censoring the “five poison”
through pressure on media, and interfering with schools and universities for instance.
It also targets the Canadian society and its government in an attempt to divide the population. For now, like in Sweden, it remains at an intermediate stage where the
negative discourse is still linked to China (i.e. it mirrors a positive narrative that
is about China).
Some attacks are anecdotic. For example, they have instrumentalized the legalization
of marijuana: Chinese media alerted Chinese Canadians to the dangers of marijuana-filled
candies on their children.253 There are several possible explanations: to try to draw Chinese
communities in Canada away from Ottawa (by creating mistrust) and closer to Beijing (by
playing the values card); to show that Beijing cares about the well-being of its “flock” all
around the world, regardless of citizenship, and that there is therefore a form of ethnic solidarity; but also, according to some, because Beijing does not rule out developing a cannabis
industry one day: it is therefore in its interest to limit the success of Canadian cannabis in
order to export some.
Cannabis is one of the potentially divisive issues that may put the Chinese community at odds with its host country Canada. But there are additional buttons in
Beijing’s arsenal, including same-sex marriage, real estate investments, shark fins (a picture
of Vancouver’s Richmond MP Alice Wong eating a shark fin soup caused a controversy in
2012) and, obviously, the purported Sinophobia of Canadians and their government.
Rightly or wrongly, many Chinese Canadians (like their Australian counterparts)
feel discriminated. Then, Chinese authorities and their proxies (associations, entrepreneurs, and students) have an easy time coming to their rescue with a twofold message. First,
racial unity. The language used in the June 2019 statement about Hong Kong, which was
signed by more than 200 pro-Beijing associations (→ p. 577) wasn’t anodyne: it explicitly
called for racial unity, invoking the Chinese “blood” tying foreigners of Chinese
descent, including Canadians, to the population of mainland China. Bill Chu, of
the Canadians for Reconciliation Society, was right to point out that “it’s divisive to say the
least. It’s trying to shift our allegiance from one country [Canada] to another [China].”254
This is precisely their objective: to convince Chinese Canadians that they are closer to
Beijing than to Ottawa. The same logic was rolled out for First Nations which share, if
not the same blood (as is the case of some Musqueam people), at least the same position
as victims.
Second, this narrative highlights the CCP’s importance: “you are being discriminated and
the solution to that is to have a powerful motherland – China. But without the CCP, your
motherland will be weak. In other words, your ability to stand tall as a Canadian depends
on the CCP, not your own ability or the values of Canadian society.”255 Sometimes, the
message is subtle, internalizing the liberal thought: “you do not need to be with us, and we
can keep our political, ideological, cultural differences. You do not need to embrace the
CCP but, as we share the same blood, belong to the same group, we will help you.” This
powerful message can bear fruits. Hence, Sinophobia is dangerous as it provides China
with opportunities for influence operations.

Other attacks occurred during the Huawei affair, for instance to turn the stigma
around: has Canada really respected the rule of law that it claims to champion when it
arrested Meng? Was this arrest really compatible with the democratic and liberal values that
Ottawa is supposed to uphold?
As with Russian operations,256 divisions are envisioned as both internal (here, dividing the Canadian society, particularly the Chinese community from the rest) and external
(amplifying potential tensions between a country and its neighbors). The Huawei case
certainly allowed Beijing to maintain and deepen existing tensions between Canada
and the United States by spreading the narrative that, contrary to appearances, this was
not a problem between Canada and China but between Canada and the United States,
with Ottawa unwillingly finding itself in the crossfire of a Chinese-American cold war
after it bowed to pressure from Washington to stop Meng. Beijing exploited the growing
anti-American sentiment in Canada by circulating the idea that Washington “threw Canada
under the bus.” Furthermore, it played on moral equivalences: China is tough, but so is
the United States, and Canada is the victim. This strategy began at the start of the scandal,
and received somewhat encouraging news in late October 2020 when the Supreme Court
of British Columbia authorized Meng Wanzhou’s lawyers to plead that Canada had been
dupped by the United States in obtaining her arrest.257
For now, Chinese operations in Canada remain tied to the Chinese community.
But their progressive Russification implies their future “desinization” – the operations will probably grow beyond issues of interest to the community to target societal
issues that concern all Canadians. This is already apparent in the use of English-language
media to try to reach, on the one hand, Chinese Canadians who do not speak Chinese,
such as second or third generation immigrants and, on the other hand, all Canadians. It is
then important to underline, as Jonathan Manthorpe did, that Chinese Canadians are not
the only ones targeted: “Non-Chinese Canadians are just as likely to be recruited as
agents of influence by the United Front and Beijing’s other intelligence services.
Indeed, because of naïveté, ignorance, or sheer venality, non-Chinese Canadians are often
easy recruits for Beijing. Chinese immigrants are more experienced with the regime most
of them have come to Canada to escape.”258

Chapter 6

THE INFEKTION 2.0 OPERATION
DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (2020)

The exact origin of the pandemic remains unknown at the time of writing, and for good
reason, as Beijing still refuses an independent investigation.1 But it appears that the SARSCoV-2 virus was found in the Hubei province (central China) as early as October 2019.2 The
magnitude and prevalence of the contaminations rapidly unsettled healthcare systems and
the societies hit by the virus. And, in the political sphere, the pandemic has already taught us
a lot. For observers of China, it revealed obvious elements that had long been forgotten and
it undermined the prevalent common sense. For instance, the weight of local institutions in
the Chinese political model, a legacy of a singular state trajectory, came to the fore; the local
state appeared for what it has always been: a political level resistant to the ambitions of the
center, quick to scupper the policies decided by the Party.3 This could be seen in the clashes
between the Hubei and Jiangxi police forces after the lockdown was lifted for the inhabitants
of Wuhan.4 The crisis provoked by the virus has also prompted us to qualify the analyses of
those presenting Xi Jinping as a new hegemonic Mao, perhaps forgetting too hastily that Xi’s
accumulation of power has not entirely eliminated the internal rivalries, the deleterious effect
of the suspension of the rules of devolution of power and the gradual induration of a state
apparatus distraught by the campaign against corruption.5
As it was probed by its population and the international community, the CCP quickly
reacted by conducting several informational operations simultaneously, some carrying a positive message (championing its management of the crisis and, as such, its political model) and others with a negative narrative (attacks against other states, especially
Western states, for their inability to manage the virus, or even for an alleged responsibility in
its apparition). On this latter point, Beijing circulated a rumor stating that the virus had
originated in the United States, and not in China. The present case study investigates
this singular operation. Without any hint to its “true” code name, if one was ever assigned,
and because it appears as a sort of replica of the KGB-led Infektion Operation in the
1980s with which the Soviets tried to make people believe that AIDS was US-made, we
named this operation “Infektion 2.0.”6 The present study focuses on the first phase of the

operation, which occurred over a month, between February 22 and March 23, 2020. The
CCP-led disinformation went on afterward, but this first sequence adequately illustrates the
similarities between the KGB-led Infektion Operation in 1983 and Infektion 2.0.

I. The Chinese informational war on the coronavirus
We delineated three components in the CCP’s informational war on the coronavirus, which were deployed simultaneously and are identified here without hierarchy between
them.

A. Controlling the hemorrhage
The Party’s first informational objective was to control narratives internally. At the
very start of the crisis, local and, later, central authorities tried to silence the pandemic by
jailing whistleblowers like doctor Li Wenliang (李文亮),7 and by imposing a tight control
over traditional media outlets and social networks.8 Faced with the evident failure of this
strategy, which probably turned the epidemic into a pandemic, and with the growing disbelief of the population – Chinese citizens compared the coronavirus to Chernobyl9 – the
Party focused on highlighting its efficiency in managing the crisis, thus building a
more positive narrative on what was happening. Hence, sustaining the regime was the priority: the CCP-led operation opted to flood Chinese citizens with multiple (and sometimes contradictory) counter-narratives in order to make them doubt its responsibility:
the Party was presented as a simple victim.

B. “Turning the stigma over”
The second act in this informational strategy relied on the tools of the Chinese public
diplomacy. They tried to demonetize critical voices in Western media that highlighted
the Chinese government’s incompetence during the first weeks of the pandemic. At that
point, the narrative endorsed by Beijing stressed that, through the adoption of radical measures, China had given time for the rest of the world to get ready for the crisis. China also
branded itself as a global savior that provided many countries with medical equipment. The
use of icons was fundamental to accompany the construction of a narrative presenting
China at the bedside of the world, as illustrated by the Italian examples below. Hence, the
Chinese campaign was a solid case of “turning the stigma over,” an expression coined by
Erving Goffman,10 to construct the image of a benevolent China (ethos).

A similar campaign was observed in several European countries such as Spain11 or Serbia
(→ p. 383).12 In France, the Chinese embassy circulated the same message of solidarity: China helps European countries. The embassy and the Chinese government communicated intensively on the masks provided by China to France. And the Twitter accounts
of the embassy and consulates relayed ceaselessly the messages of the Party.13 This PR
campaign targeted the entire French population but the Chinese diaspora more specifically,
as shown by the articles that circulated on WeChat.14

Yet, the Chinese government did not stop at this “mask diplomacy” nourished with a
particular iconography and repeated propaganda messages. On March 15, a spokesperson
for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a video on Twitter showing Romans
thanking China for its help and playing the Chinese national anthem (see images
below). But an Italian factchecking website showed that it was a montage.15 The Romans
seen on the video had come together to thank healthcare workers, not China. In fact, the
video circulated by the Chinese government was a fake made from two videos posted by
the Corriere della Sera the previous day, and none of them advertised the Chinese anthem or
any “thank you” to China. The sound was actually added on the original videos.16 With that,
the Chinese authorities tried to manipulate European public opinions.

This aspect of the informational strategy consisted in accusing other countries,
beginning with the United States, of being responsible for the sanitary crisis linked
to the coronavirus.17 China took advantage of an ideal timing: as the first country hit by
the virus, it was logically the first country to (presumably) control it. Then, it used a flurry
of tools to propagate a narrative meant to weaken its adversaries. At that point, Europe
and North America were busy managing the urgency of the sanitary crisis and could not
dedicate resources to counter this narrative with the strength it would have required.

The CCP did not limit itself to vague insinuations. It put together a robust disinformation campaign that could resist initial fact-checking, to make people believe in an
American origin to the coronavirus. This Chinese operation reminded us of the Infektion
Operation set up by Service A of the KGB18 during the 1980s to propagate the idea that
the HIV virus had been conceived by the U.S. government to target African Americans
and homosexuals.

II. The Soviet “Infektion” Operation: a Model for China?
Cold War specialists often point to a major difference between Western and Eastern
intelligence services: while the former were primarily tasked with collecting intelligence,
the latter dedicated a colossal part of their resources to disinformation, what the Soviets
called dezinformatsiya, an element of the larger “active measures” (aktivnyye meropriata).19 Each
KGB “residency” abroad had officers tasked with those missions. In fact, their internal
notation was almost exclusively based on their ability to suggest disinformation operations
taking advantage of the fault lines in their assigned countries. Moreover, unlike the U.S. system, and more broadly Western countries, where “covert actions” were designed as exceptional, Soviet “active measures” were largely integrated into the foreign policy of the
USSR.20 All Party organs had to ensure that the operations were successful.
The “Infektion” Operation (which was apparently named “Denver” by East Germany’s
intelligence)21 was likely motivated by degrading East-West relations in the late 1970s and
early 1980s.22 Faced with Reagan’s efforts to exhaust the Soviet regime, Andropov, the
former head of the KGB, responded with swollen aggressivity and more “active measures”
operations.
Beginning in the 1950s, the Soviets launched large-scale disinformation operations that
exploited the fear of chemical and bacteriological weapons that had taken hold of Western
public opinions.23 During the 1970s, the field was even more favorable in the United States,
where the media had revealed biological warfare programs of the U.S. army, including at
Fort Detrick, in Maryland. When the HIV virus emerged, in the early 1980s, the Soviets
immediately took the opportunity to launch a disinformation operation to make people believe that the U.S. Army was responsible for AIDS, presented as a biological weapon
conceived to target African Americans and homosexuals.
The actual operation began on July 17, 1983, with a letter published in the Indian
newspaper The Patriot, created in 1962 by the KGB to propagate fake information useful to the USSR’s interests.24 The document was signed by an anonymous U.S. scientist but

actually manufactured by the KGB, and it affirmed that AIDS resulted from experimentations in biological warfare conducted by the U.S. Army.
For two years, there was no particular development in this operation, until September
1985 when the KGB instructed Eastern European services to propagate the fake
information published in The Patriot.25 In October 1985, the KGB organized the reproduction of the article from The Patriot in a Moscow newspaper it controlled, the Literaturnaya
Gazeta.
In August 1986, the operation took another turn with the Stasi’s involvement, including
its Division X, in charge of disinformation. During the Summit of Non-Aligned Countries,
German intelligence services circulated an article written by two biologists, Jakob and Lili
Segal, untitled “AIDS: Its Nature and Origin.” This article offered a scientific basis to
allegations initially published in The Patriot. For months, these arguments were relayed
ceaselessly by Soviet and foreign media (newspapers, magazines, radios, TV channels) and
the couple of biologists was introduced as French scientists. This was how the operation
got traction: hundreds of newspapers, many of them without any tie to the Soviet
Union, covered the narrative fabricated by the KGB, sometimes including information
that was not in the original document. For instance, several articles insisted that AIDS was
the result of a plot whereas others described it as an accident in U.S. research on biological
weapons. The “theory” continued to spread and found additional relays in the U.S.
radical Left. The Covert Action Information Bulletin, which investigated U.S. covert operations,
covered the Soviet story and contributed to its prevalence among the U.S. Left.26 On March
30, 1987, the narrative fabricated by the KGB reached the primetime show hosted
by Dan Rather on CBS News, which gave another considerable breath of fresh air to the
operation.
The Soviet campaign had an immense impact, especially in Africa and in certain
segments of the U.S. population where the theory continues to circulate today. In
2005, for instance, the rapper Kanye West mentionned it in his song “Heard ‘EM Say.”
Nowadays, this is a textbook case which probably inspired the Russians in their disinformation campaign targeting vaccines and which now seems to feed the Chinese
approach on disinformation.
In a series of investigative reports published in The New York Times in 2018, Adam B.
Ellick, Adam Westbrook and Jonah M. Kessel tried to reconstruct the Soviet methodology of disinformation.27 They identified a seven-step process:
• Primo, identify weaknesses in the target country, dissents or fault lines that could be
accentuated and exploited by the Soviet Union.
• Secundo, create a lie so big that no one could figure out that it was fabricated.
• Tertio, add a portion of truth to the lie to make the entire message more believable.

• Quinto, identify “useful idiots” capable of relaying the message coined by Moscow.
• Sexto, make sure the USSR was never mentionned. There was only one rule to avoid
that: always deny any involvement.
• Septimo, bet on the long run. All operations were not meant to bear immediate results,
and it could seemingly require years before the effects were known.
Arguably, this model now needs to be adapted to account for the changes that followed
the introduction of the Internet, which the authors described as “anonymity, ubiquity,
immediacy.” And yet, it is a particularly efficient blueprint for a nation in search of
informational power.29

III. Chronology of the Operation “Infektion 2.0”
Contrary to a Soviet operation that lasts several years, the Chinese operation was
rolled out in a month in 2020, thanks to social media. Not unlike the Soviets, the
Chinese reacted rapidly to a virus that they had not anticipated: HIV, like the Covid-19,
are phenomenon that provided these countries’ agents with an opportunity to target their
adversaries with disinformation. As it happens, with the coronavirus, the Russians – not
the Chinese – were the first to react: on January 20, 2020, a TV channel funded by the
Russian Ministry of Defense, Zvezda, was the first media to describe the virus as a U.S.
biological weapon, during an interview with Igor Nikulin, an “expert” that often appears
on propaganda TV channels.30 He was previously known for denying Bashar al-Assad’s use
of chemical weapons in Syria,31 and for accusing Americans of using biological weapons
for instance.32 Meanwhile, in China, when a resident of Inner Mongolia circulated the same
story on the app Kuaishou six days later (a video viewed 14,000 times), he was charged with
spreading rumors and detained for ten days.33 And yet, Chinese diplomats and media were
spreading that same rumor a month later. In the meantime, Beijing came to understand
that there was an opportunity following the “intense internal criticisms” that the CCP
had to face for its management of the crisis,34 and which was taken up globally, including
in the United States. On the defensive, the Party-State reacted by diverting the attention, accusing Washington of being responsible for the pandemic. Strictly speaking, the

operation started on February 22, with the use of a Chinese study on the transmission
of the virus, which had been published the previous day: based on 93 complete genomes
of the virus, the scientists defended that the virus could have been imported from a place
other than the Huanan market, in Wuhan.35 The sequence of events then unfolded as such:

Prevention, acknowledging in front of the House Oversight Committee of the U.S. Congress

spokeswoman rejected the nickname “Chinese virus.” At about the same time, the ministry’s
other spokesperson, Zhao Linjiang, wondered, in a tweet, about the involvement of the
US Army, which he deemed a possible origin of the coronavirus. He instrumentalized the
speech given by Robert Redfield; he also highlighted the presence of a US team at the 7th

that the Americans could have infected the Chinese population in Wuhan.41

two articles published by a Larry Romanoff, on globalresearch.ca (mondialisation.ca in
its French version), an emanation from the Center for Research on Globalization (CRG),
a self-described independent think tank based in Montreal (→ p. 602). These two articles
endorsed the theory of an American-made virus. During this “peak” of March 12-13,
Zhao tweeted no less than eleven times about this topic and his messages were “cited
over 99,000 times over the next six weeks, in at least 54 languages.”42 They were relayed
by Chinese diplomats and media, but also “Venezuela’s foreign minister and RT’s correspondent in Caracas, as well as Saudi accounts close to the kingdom’s royal family.”43
Meanwhile, the Global Times published an article explaining that the United States
was engaged in an informational war against China to make Beijing responsible for the
apparition of the Covid-19. The article highlighted the important number of persons
(37,000) who had died from the flu in the U.S. in 2019, implying that some deaths might
have been caused by the Covid-19 instead.44

An article that covered the hypothesis of an American responsibility largely circulated
the same day on both WeChat (→ p. 196) and the Guancha website (→ p. 491).45 It
evoked in particular the existence of a petition deposited on the dedicated website of
the White House to demand that the U.S. government tells the truth about Fort Detrick.
It then described a series of strange coincidences: that Fort Detrick closed in July 2019,
a virulent flu in the United States (it never happened), a drill on fighting pandemics
organized in the United States in October, the emergence of the coronavirus in China
and, finally, the suppression of online videos that evoked the closing of Fort Detrick.
Its author explained that the petition had been deleted from the website of the U.S.
government because it had not received the necessary votes (100,000) in 30 days to
be kept online. Furthermore, the article mentioned the evidence uncovered by Larry
Romanoff but seemed to lean toward the hypothesis of an accidental infection through
U.S. sportspersons present in Wuhan in October and November 2019.

before the pandemic started in China; for the author, it could not have been a mere
coincidence. This is a classical method, even a topos, of conspiracy theories, along with
pseudo-comparatist efforts: an historical analogy gives the illusion of analytical rigor.
For instance, the Spanish flu emerged in the United States but Washington let Spain
bear the responsibility for the pandemic, and it was allegedly doing the same today
with China today.

that quoted Daniel Lucey, an expert on infectious diseases at Georgetown University,

around the origin of the virus, which should have encouraged Americans to be more
cautious.

play on a homophony because 钟 and 中 (“China”) have the same pronunciation, and 声 also carries the meaning of
“voice.” As such, Zhong Sheng can also be translated as “the voice of China” (https://archive.vn/p0DIv).

After this date, the narrative of a U.S involvement in the creation of the Covid19 became less prominently relayed – although it did not disappear. The Chinese
Communist Party then adopted a new narrative that presented China as the country that
managed to fight the virus efficiently. It encouraged others to adopt the same methods,
while several voices stressed that the nature of the regime was intimately linked to China’s
success in managing the sanitary crisis.
Hitherto, the narrative portraying the United States as responsible for the emergence of the Covid-19 – either as a voluntary aggression or as an involuntary accident – circulated rapidly in Chinese diasporas, especially in France and Italy, where the
theories have been abundantly relayed. Two ideas seemed to be recurring: the virus was
presented as a revenge for the discriminations and racism to which the Chinese were subjected at the start of the pandemic; and the fact that an American origin of the virus made
it easier to explain why the virus kept circulating elsewhere, in France and Italy especially,
when China was able to control its circulation.
This is probably the reason why the narrative of a U.S. virus was essentially circulating on WeChat. A WeChat account managed by journalists from the Global Times
continued to defend the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus may have escaped from a
laboratory of the U.S. Army in Fort Detrick. One article covered the history of the laboratory and suggested that it was both highly secretive in its research on biological weapons
and badly regulated.51 Besides, the articles posted on WeChat were also very critical of the
U.S. system. Xiakedao (侠客岛), the WeChat account of the Renmin Ribao – whom we
mentioned previously – affirmed that a third of the Covid-19-related deaths in the United
States occurred in retirement homes, calling it a “massacre approved by the government” (a
similar accusation was also formulated by the Chinese ambassador to France, as we noted
in part three → p. 235).52 As for CCTV’s account, it declared that the United States had

reduced the budget of the CDC, which explained the Americans’ inability to deal with the
virus. It also inferred that a plot might have explained so much inertia.53

IV. An Analysis of the “Infektion 2.0” Operation
Several aspects and details of this operation deserve to be analyzed. First of all, it is
necessary to return to what constituted the core of Zhao Lijian’s argumentation, in other
words the two articles published by Larry Romanoff.54 We then evaluate the motivations behind the operation and its effectiveness.

A. The CRG
In the two tweets he published on March 13, Zhao Lijian encouraged his readers to visit
the website of globalreasearch.ca (CRG) to read the articles published by Larry Romanoff.
The CRG was created in 2001 by a Canadian, Michel Chossudovsky, a professor at the
University of Ottawa close to Thierry Meyssan and a regular guest on the Russian channel
RT.55 The CRG is famous for its active role in the “conspirasphere” (its articles are,
for example, taken up on Le Grand Soir, a militant newspaper of “alternative information”
administered by Maxime Vivas, mentioned in the previous part → p. 335) and as a relay
of Russian campaigns of disinformation. In fact, its activities have drawn the attention of
NATO.56 CRG’s English website is visited by a million visitors each month (1.59 million in
February 2020) and the French version by more than 100,000 visitors (113,000 in February
2020).57 Its articles adopy the method used by some Russian media outlets: instrumentalizing and hijacking neutral voices and serious outlets to deliver a message that reinforces
their own narrative.
One of the two articles written by Larry Romanoff relied on a report presumably published by Asahi TV in Japan. It also quoted Shen Yi (沈逸), a professor of international
relations at Fudan University, in Shanghai and, more importantly, a Taiwanese virologist
that intervened in Zhe ! Bushi xinwen (這! 不是新聞)58 (This! This is not information), a TV
show aired on the Taiwanese channel EBC Dongsen Financial News (東森財經新聞台), an
emanation of the Eastern Broadcasting Company (東森電視), formerly known as Eastern
Television (ETTV).59
Using three different sources, including two that were not expected to be partial because
coming from “adversaries” of China (a Taiwanese virologist and a Japanese TV show), Larry
Romanoff hoped to bring some objective veneer to his words. In reality, it was only an illusion. First, no link to the Japanese TV show was given; only to an article of the Chinese Global

Times mentioning the Japanese program. In fact, Romanoff simply quoted the Global Times,
not the Japanese report. Then, without assessing the argumentation of the Taiwanese virologist – who used a set of scientific tools to show that the virus could only have come from
the United States because the largest number of variants of the virus was in that country – it
should be noted that ETTV was already known for its pro-Guomindang (KMT) and pro-Beijing positions. As for Shen Yi, his words (which are quoted without a verifiable source) simply
reasserted that China kept wondering about the primary origin of the virus. In conclusion, the
evidence shown by Larry Romanoff was weak and certainly not as neutral as he said.

B. Larry Romanoff
The author of the articles, Larry Romanoff, introduced himself as a former consultant
and current professor at Fudan University, in Shanghai, the city where he supposedly lives.
He mentioned only one way to contact him: an email address on the Chinese messaging
service QQ (2186604556@qq.com). His first article was published on globalresearch.ca on
September 24, 2019, in which he described the Tian’anmen events as a U.S. attempt at promoting a color revolution in China. He wrote 72 articles in six months, all tainted with
conspiracy theory, and, after late January 2020, almost all of them dealt with the coronavirus. Even though they are not academic articles, this was still an important activity.
Investigating Larry Romanoff ’s background provided few results. Matthew Brown, journalist at USA Today, tried to contact Romanoff to obtain more details on some elements
mentioned in his articles, but without success.60 Larry Romanoff could not be reached.
Moreover, there is no recent photo of him. The Russian Pravda, which published six of
his articles between January 9 and March 9, 2021, illustrated his biography with a photo…
of Ernest Hemingway.61

who is presumably a visiting professor at Fudan University, teaching in the MBA
– despite the lack of mention of his name on the English and Chinese versions of
the website of the prestigious Shanghai university. The managers of the MBA program interviewed by the Wall Street Journal confirmed not knowing him, either as “Larry
Romanoff,”67 or under his presumed LinkedIn pseudonym, “Larry Long,” a “visiting
professor” at Fudan University, trained at the University of Calgary, and now teaching in
the former’s MBA program.68

Nonetheless, this fake profile gives some interesting information since it lists bearcanada.com
as its personal site, which is no longer online but whose archives show that it had three distinct
lives.69 During the first one, between 2000 and 2005, bearcanada.com was the website of
Treasures of the Orient Inc, a Calgary-based company, North American representative
of Bear Productions, a Hong Kong-based company producing music for a children’s choir (the
Bear Children’s Choir of Hong Kong), and an importer of Asian products:

Twenty years later, the phone number still appeared on the Hong Kong website of the
children’s choir.71 As for the fax number, in Canadian reverse directories it appears as a
telephone number assigned to “Larry Romanoff,” who was indeed domiciled at this
address.72

And indeed, Romanoff was at the time the owner of this company, as confirmed
by a photo published in the Calgary Herald in 2001, because of a news item (Canada
Post sent him by mistake an invoice of more than $140 million73). Larry Romanoff was
introduced as an entrepreneur with a business importing music and toys for children from
China. The article is illustrated by a picture of him, taken in July 2001, which reveals the
name and address of his company, which correspond to the one of the bearcanada.com
website.

At that time, Romanoff was importing Chinese music. The manager of the Bear Children’s
Choir in Hong Kong, from whom he ordered 100 CDs for resale in North America, found
“a little weird” that “some Canadian guy only speaking English [sold] Cantonese music.”74

In 2002, Romanoff transferred parts of his business on another website, an online marketplace hosted at members.shaw.ca/toyscanada/toymain.html.75
One can assume, as the Wall Street Journal does, that this “Larry” Romanoff of 2001 is
the “Lawrence Delvin” Romanoff who left another trail in the same Calgary Herald three
years earlier. A 1998 article reported that he was arrested in 1995 for trafficking in used
stamps that he cleaned and resold for new.76 At his trial three years later, he pleaded guilty
but also good faith, explaining that he had tried to raise funds for his church, and producing a letter of thanks that Mother Teresa had personally sent him in April 1995. The article
presented him as 55 years old and owner of a small advertising agency.
If this is indeed the same person (who would therefore be 58 years old in the photo
above), it would mean that he quickly reoriented his carrer after his 1998 trial, since his
company Treasures of the Orient Inc. was created the following year. The Alberta Business
Registry indicates that Treasures of the Orient Inc. was registered in September 1999
and deregistered in 2005.77
And for good reason, in 2005 the home page of bearcanada.com indicated a move
from Calgary to Shanghai:

His departure was confirmed by a readers’ letter published by The Economist in July 2005
in which Larry Romanoff signed a letter from Calgary.79 In 2008, in another letter mailed
to the Globe and Mail this time, he presented himself as “businessman living in Shanghai”
critical of the Chinese policy of the Prime Minister Stephen Harper.80
Thus began the second life of bearcanada.com, which was a transitional phase: between
2006 and 2009, the site was essentially an empty shell, with only the home page changed.
It presented a “Canadian business, staffed by Canadians, and resident in Shanghai” that
offered “a variety of products manufactured in China”.

It is the third life of the site that is the most interesting as far as we are concerned, because
it is the one that reveals the Larry Romanoff we know today. In 2010, bearcanada.com,

The site is also particularly anti-Semitic, with a dedicated section containing numerous articles and unambiguous visuals:

Screenshot from the website bearcanada.com/fae/fae.html on July 12, 2012.83

The articles were signed 龙信明, which literally means “Larry Romanoff,” as did the
header where the same name was indicated on the left. In a section entitled “Shanghai
Diary,” the author published photos and comments from his walks around the city. Several
remarks (about missing Canadian lobsters, comparing climates or prices between Shanghai
and Calgary, his nephew Eddie in Canada, his return to Canada for Christmas, etc.) leave
little doubt that the author was indeed Larry Romanoff, the Canadian from Calgary. He
published a very large number of articles, on a wide variety of subjects. This version of
the site was active between 2010 and 2013: publications were less frequent in 2013, the
site stopped evolving from July 2013 and disappeared between May and December
2014. It has since been offline.
In 2012-2013, several “alternative” news sites reposted its articles, including 4thmedia.org, the English version of the “April Internet” website we mentioned in Part II due
its links to the CYL (→ p. 77). One of the most shared articles is a rewriting of the events
of Tian’anmen, which would not at all have happened as the “Western” media described
it.84 These articles are signed “doctor” or “professor Long Xinming of Fudan University,”
presented as the founder and author of the website bearcanada.com.85 Long Xinming, 龙
信明 in Chinese, is the alias that Larry Romanoff admitted using. He also signed
“Larry Romanoff (龙信明)” in 2010 and in 2020.86 The LinkedIn page we mentioned
earlier is actually a mix of the two names (“Larry Long”). The equivalence Larry Romanoff
= Long Xinming (龙信明) = founder and author of boardcanada.com is therefore
indisputable.
In addition, the link between the third version of boardcanada.com (2010-2014)
and Larry Romanoff ’s current sites, moonofshanghai.com and bluemoonofshanghai.com (since 2020), is also established since we find on both his current websites the
banner that appeared previously on boardcanada.com:

Romanoff did not appear to have used this alias after 2013. Moreover, when Ramesh
Thakur, former UN Under Secretary General and Vice-Rector of the UN University, revisited in 2019 the site on which “Long Xinming’s” article on Tian’anmen was published in
2013, he found that ”the author’s name had changed to Bhaiaidil Fiverr, which might
raise questions about authenticity”.87 The site in question is since inaccessible, and Bhaiaidil
Fiverr is a unique name, which is not used anywhere else.
Between 2010 and 2012, Romanoff was also one of the contributors to the collective
blog Hidden Harmonies, created in February 2010, on which he reposted some of his
articles. Note that his biographical presentation did not change between 2010 and 2021.

Source : https://archive.vn/tb5tl.

He did not contribute to Hidden Harmonies for seven years, then came back in March
2020.88 He was listed as a contributor again, and re-published one of the two articles on
the coronavirus originally published on GlobalResearch.ca and relayed by Zhao Lijian on
March 13.89
In conclusion, while a quick analysis of Larry Romanoff ’s latest publications
(2019-2020) could legitimately lead to the belief that he was “probably a fake blogger created from scratch by the Chinese to echo their messages,” all of the above
makes this hypothesis less credible as the means deployed to create Romanoff ’s “legend” would be disproportionate to the expected gain.90 Most likely, Larry Romanoff
exists and is a “useful idiot,” perhaps influenced and mentored by the Party-State.
However, several elements in his trajectory remain to be clarified: his initial links
with China (how does a Canadian from Calgary become the North American representative of a choir of Hong Kong children?); his anti-American and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that suddenly emerged in 2010 (had he been developing them for a longer
period?); and the “gap” of about six years, between 2013 (the end of bearcanada.com)
and 2019 (his debut on GlobalResearch.ca), during which this already prolific author
seemed to have stopped publishing, at least under his own name as well as under his alias
Long Xinming (why?).

Jul. 2020), 42. In the unpublished IRSEM note of April 2020, we ourselves envisaged that Larry Romanoff could be a
front name, a virtual agent, behind which hides an agency of the Party-State apparatus, or a non-state actor in its pay,
which would imply relatively important means of coordination (Charon, L’opération “Covid-19”).

C. The motivations behind the operation
There is no lack of possible motives to explain the CCP’s decision to launch such an
operation, and they were mentioned all through this report: creating a diversion for the
Chinese population toward an evident scapegoat; offering an indirect contribution
to the perennity of the regime; or an easier switch to the narrative presenting China
as benevolent by concentrating attacks on the United States. It might also have
been an attempt at weakening the democratic model of government with the narrative on the “good” sanitary governance, and even with the efficient Chinese model of crisis
management that was used in targeting the public of “soft targets” (Italy, Spain, Serbia…),
with important mediatic resources. The operation could also be partly explained by the
weakening belief among the party’s leadership that China needs to maintain good relations
with the United States.
This operation could also be understood as a Chinese retaliation, or a warning
sent to the United States, following a series of particularly offensive decisions taken by
Washington in February: on the 10th, four Chinese soldiers from the 54th research institute
were criminally charged for the 2017 Equifax hack (image below);91 Huawei was charged
with extorsion on the 13th;92 and Washington decided to label Chinese state media as CCP
agents on the 17th.93 It is however impossible to confirm that hypothesis with the information at our disposal at the moment, but the proximity of the events deserved to be noted.

Now, we need to explain the reasons behind the end of the operation “Infektion 2.0.,”
or at least behind its reduced intensity. Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian interpreted it as a sign
of the adoption of Russian methods by China.94 With such an interpretation, Cui Tiankai’s
declarations would thus be motivated by the will to spread contradictory slogans to confuse
the enemy. But it might also have been done to appease the United States – which is all the
more possible as the CCP could leave the fake information circulating unattended,
finding its own relays in the conspiracy spheres in Europe and in the United States, or in
Chinese diasporas.

D. The Operation’s efficiency
It is too early to evaluate the efficacity of an operation the consequences of which may
be felt over a few years and through unexpected channels. The future will tell us how the
belief in an American origin of the coronavirus settled in the minds. At the moment, the
Chinese narrative has seldom been reused, which could be a sign of resistance in the targeted societies, except perhaps in Chinese diasporas. That said, the operation undeniably
contributes to the fragilization of democratic societies by insidiously questioning the
nature of their institutions and by attacking the very possibility of truth, which is the key
to consent in liberal societies.

V. An Undeniable Russification of Chinese methods
For the authors, this operation is interesting because it confirms the Russification/
sovietization of Chinese methods of disinformation. To illustrate this evolution, we
can simply bring back the seven steps identified earlier by the authors of The New York
Times’s article: (→ p. 594):
• Primo, China, like the USSR before, promptly reacted and saw an opportunity for
concealed disinformation in the Covid-19.
• Secundo, there again, the Soviet method was precisely respected. The idea of a virus
created by the U.S. Army and implanted in Wuhan through the World Military Games is
so difficult to conceive that it could only be true.
• Tertio, the Chinese lie was built on enough truthful elements to make it credible: the
speech delivered by Robert Redfield on earlier cases of Covid-19, the near coincidence
between the games in Wuhan and the epidemic, the U.S. drill on a similar scenario a
month before the epidemic, the uncertainty over the exact origin of the virus and on
its initial transmission by animals, the historical analogy with the Spanish flu. All these
elements reinforced the plausibility of the Chinese narrative.
• Quarto, the Chinese hand was largely hidden, at least without a thorough investigation. Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs relayed elements made public by
third-party actors. The Party never directly advanced new arguments, and simply relayed
them – such as the Soviets did. Larry Romanoff could be perceived as a neutral actor.
• Quinto, useful idiots were legions: the Taiwanese virologist was one of them, as were
Michel Chossudovsky and Larry Romanoff. The WHO could be listed as well as it kept
defending the Chinese version against all odds.
• Sexto, like the Soviets, China denied any involvement. When the narrative changed,
after the intervention of Cui Tiankai on U.S. TV, the Chinese government evoked democratic processes internal to the party to explain the diverging opinions among diplomats.
Yet, all this could be seen as a pure construction because the implementation of the
operation by Zhao Lijian, a mere diplomat, gave an opportunity for the party to present
his declarations as an isolated and unofficial position. But it is unimaginable that the
Party left a high-ranking diplomat say such things, for several weeks, without making its

disapproval known. Hence, the narrative advertised by Zhao was validated by Chinese
authorities.
• Septimo, this is where China seemed to have kept its distance from the “ideal type”
of the Soviet operation. The Chinese campaign ended too quickly and without enough
time to assess its reach. It is also impossible to tell what the hopes of the regime were:
briefly diverting the Chinese public by weakening an adversary? Forcefully inscribing the
possible American creation of the virus in the minds? Or was it a more “experimental”
approach to an operation, one that could pave the way for more complex disinformation
activities in the future?
Similarly to the Soviets, the Chinese have an integrated vision of political warfare: “active
measures” are routine methods used by the CCP that involve numerous and diverse actors.
But the exact level of coordination between these actors remains a question mark.
Did diplomats act on their own initiative? It seems improbable. The articles published
during the operation also suggested a common action with the propaganda arms of the
Party.
Finally, we found that the coronavirus did not simply lead to the implementation of a
Chinese influence operation modeled on the Russian and Soviet operations, but also to
concurring actions that named the United States as the source of the virus. For instance,
an article published by RT highjacked the words of Wilbur Ross, the U.S. Secretary of
Commerce, to increase the perception that the United States had an economic interest in
seeing the virus circulate.95 For that reason, the Russian narrative was easily inscribed in
the Chinese narrative and it provided the latter with a breath of fresh air by bringing
it to a larger public. In fact, a possible cooperation between Russian and Chinese actors
is one of the questions to which the conclusion of the present report will try to answer.

SUMMARY OF THE FOURTH PART

Taiwan and Hong Kong are on the frontline of the “political warfare” waged by Beijing: first
because they are CCP priorities but also because they are outposts, training grounds, and “R&D
lab” for Chinese operations – which are later perfected and implemented on other targets worldwide. This is not different from how Georgia and Ukraine were useful to Russian operations.
The first step to widen the circle of Chinese operations targeted Australia and New Zealand.
Then, it reached new targets globally, such as Europe and North America (among others). This
part introduced six case studies: Taiwan, Singapore, Sweden, Canada, an operation that targeted
Hong Kong protestors in 2009, and another that framed the coronavirus as an American creation.
On Taiwan, Beijing does intervene from the outside: the traditional Chinese media form a
powerful system to disseminate Party propaganda, but they have only limited influence. As the
Party became aware of it, new dedicated outlets were created, including VTS, CHBC and Haifeng – all covers for the PLA Base 311. However, most Chinese influence operations use local
relays, following Lenin who stated that “the easiest way to capture a fortress is from within.” It
allows the Party-State to hide its tracks and increase the likelihood of positive results. Among
these relays are Taiwanese media outlets that are enticed and/or forced to follow Beijing through
various means (including access to the Chinese market). There are cases of Taiwanese outlets
censoring themselves to do business in China for instance. But there are other options: advertising contracts, equity participations through the purchase of shares (and sometimes overall
control of the company), buyouts by Taiwanese tycoons – as illustrated by the emblematic purchase of the China Times corporation by Want Want, with clear consequences for its editorial
line – and additional levers such as clandestine funding, nominations to key positions, or bilateral
forums. Beijing also relies on private cyber-armies, i.e. groups of individuals that can be hired to
wage campaigns for/against something/someone; political parties (the KMT has become less
central as the Party-State is seeking to diversify its channels, with three small pro-unification parties serving as its relays: the New Party (NP), the Chinese Unification Promotion Party (CUPP)
and the Home Party (HP)). Politicians are also targeted individually for their possible or proven
pro-Chinese inclinations and based on their strategic position in the Taiwanese political sphere.
Among the influencers and other intermediaries used by Beijing, there are groups and personalities from the cultural and artistic spheres, civic organizations, networks of Buddhist and Taoist
temples, business circles, soldiers, YouTubers, discontent citizens, Taiwanese living abroad (in
mainland China) and Chinese insiders (in Taiwan).
Besides, Taiwan is also interesting for the numerous cases of information manipulation that
have targeted the island, including the Jebi typhoon affair (2018), which caused the death of a
man, or the electoral interferences during the municipal elections in November 2018 first, and
later the presidential and legislative elections in January 2020. Furthermore, agriculture has long
been an important target for disinformation, and the example of a Chinese that pretended to
be a Taiwanese YouTuber showed that language is no longer a sufficient barrier to protect Taiwan from Chinese information manipulation operations. Li Jie (2019), the Covid-19 pandemic
(2020), and the bilateral diplomatic relation were additional examples. Finally, there is the case

of the (permanent threat of) military might: the use of military drills for psychological warfare
against Taiwan is also one of the main levers of Chinese influence operations – and they have
increased in recent years.
In conclusion, the Chinese political war against Taiwan brought some tactical successes
inasmuch as it contributed to polarizing the Taiwanese society. But it was a strategic failure
and even a counterproductive policy: both incentives and punitive measures under Xi Jinping did not produce the expected results. A majority of the population remains favorable
to the president and to the DPP and it has grown more distrustful of China. In fact, the
nationalist sentiment rises: the number of people that describe themselves as “solely Taiwanese” has never been higher (67%). The Hong Kong crisis was no stranger to this, having
acted as a powerful deterrent. And the government took a number of measures to combat
interference, especially Chinese interference, which should make influence operations more
difficult to conduct in the future. It also reinforced its determination to reduce the country’s
dependence on China, insisting on diversifying its economy – especially in the sectors used
as levers by Beijing (i.e. tourism). In general, the recent increased aggressiveness of China
against Taiwan, and against the rest of the world, has considerably boosted the attractiveness of the island. In a word, Chinese efforts to weaken and isolate Taiwan have had the
opposite effect.
Hong Kong demonstrators were targeted by informational operations in 2019, which
were also tied to Taiwan (the same recycled methods and content were apparently adapted:
on the one hand, the Hong Kong crisis helped structure the narratives against Taiwan; on the
other hand, China seemingly used its Taiwanese allies to intervene in Hong Kong). Most of
the time, it was political “spamming” meant to flood (local and international) public opinions
with doctored sensationalist content (i.e. comparing Hong Kong demonstrators to cockroaches or jihadist terrorists). To that end, they used social networks with an international
audience, such as TikTok (censored and instrumentalized by Chinese authorities), but also
Facebook and Twitter, both banned in China (but patriotic trolls are authorized and even
encouraged to “hop” over the “Great Firewall” that is supposed to prevent Chinese Internet
users from accessing the non-Chinese cyberspace). Twitter explained that it suppressed approximately 200,000 fake accounts part of a “coordinated state-backed operation” aimed at
“undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement.” The platform
also published the archives of the 936 most active accounts, all originating from the PRC.
The data showed that the campaign was launched hurriedly with two traditional types of accounts, the “mercenary” (bought or stolen) and “dormant” accounts; they spread three main
narratives: a rejection of the demonstrators, support for the Hong Kong police, and conspiracy theories on the participation of “Westerners” in the protests. One of the main clues
to the “massive and coordinated” but also hurried nature of the disinformation campaign
could be found in the dates when the accounts were created: more than half were created
within three months. Our investigation also identified a series of dormant accounts that had
been reactivated, and relaying accounts (used to retweet and share content published by the
main accounts). Moreover, it confirmed that the two main arguments justifying the attacks
were the alleged violence of the protestors and their manipulation by “anti-Chinese foreign
forces.”
Finally, the Hong Kong example highlighted the importance of the (relatively) new “corps
of volunteers,” or “water armies,” usually used to artificially increase the popularity of a star or
product, but that can be refitted in times of crisis to conduct veritable campaigns of hatred. Two
of the most famous of these groups are Diba and Fanquan, and they conducted joint actions
against Hong Kong demonstrators.

Singapore, which has an ambivalent relationship with China, a mixture of proximity and
defiance, has a number of particularities that makes it particularly vulnerable, but at the same
time particularly resistant, to Chinese influence. The city-state is structurally vulnerable due to its
size, hyperconnectivity, common use of both English and Chinese, its dependence on imports,
tense relation to Malaysia and, most importantly, because of the very multiethnic and inter-communitarian nature of the Singaporean society. The country also has vulnerabilities specifically
attractive to China: a majority of its population has Chinese roots (74.5%), which encourages
Beijing to present Singapore as a “Chinese country.” Besides, the population is organized in
clan associations, faces heightened Chinese immigration and is economically attracted to China.
Finally, Beijing can rely on mediatic and individual relays, and on a similar approach to human
rights. In this context, Beijing’s goal is to “impose a Chinese identity onto Singapore,” to make
the city-state stop training its armed forces in Taiwan, stop speaking about freedom of navigation, and further increase its trade relations with China.
Several events are symptomatic of the Chinese influence in Singapore and played a part in
the rapidly rising awareness of the public: with the Terrex affair culminated a series of incidents
in the bilateral relation in 2016, and several spying scandals (including Huang Jing and Jun Wei
Yeo).
That said, Singapore is also particularly well-equipped to counter this pressure. Its defense
relies on the development of a counter-narrative on a unique national, multiethnic and multicultural identity, and more specifically on a singular Chinese Singaporean identity. On the paper,
three-fourth of the inhabitants are “Chinese” but a large majority of them describe themselves
as Singaporean. The cultural penetration of China is weak. On the other hand, there is a growing awareness of the risks posed by Chinese influence, which is catalyzed by a personality like
Bilahari Kausikan, a former diplomat and secretary of state, who stated that China “uses a range
of tactics--from legitimate diplomacy to more covert and often illegal deployment of agents of
influence and operations--to sway decision makers or public opinion leaders.” He believes that
these operations against Singapore were intended “not just to direct behavior, but to condition
behavior. China does not just want you to comply with its wishes, it wants you to… do what it
wants without being told.” Singapore is therefore very aware of its vulnerabilities. Moreover, in
the field of combating information manipulation, Singapore is, along with Sweden, one of the
most advanced states in the world.
Sweden is a typical case of a “Machiavellian moment.” While the bilateral relationship
was developing and China’s image was quite good, the appointment of a new ambassador in
August 2017 – who became one of the precursors of the “wolf warrior” diplomats – altered
the situation. Indeed, the ambassador quickly multiplied offensive and threatening declarations, against media outlets for instance. Some Swedish journalists have gone public about
becoming the victims of intimidation attempts from Chinese diplomats but also from diverse
organizations of Chinese students. This aggressive Chinese drift in Sweden had notable consequences: the Chinese-Swedish relation has considerably deteriorated, Sweden closed all
its Confucius Institutes, rewrote its “Chinese strategy,” and the city of Goteborg cancelled
its twin-city program with Shanghai. Finally, Sweden banned all Chinese (Huawei and ZTE)
equipment from its ongoing 5G call for tender. Now, approximately 80% of Swedish citizens
view China negatively. This is a disastrous track record for the ambassador but what may
seem incomprehensible from the outside, because blatantly counter-productive, can be explained in the following way: the goal was to seduce the CCP, not Sweden. And the latter was
a good “testing ground” for this new strategy of wolf warrior diplomats for several reasons:
the perfect size (small enough not to become a threat, but large enough to be significant,
at the European-scale at least), a world champion of liberal and democratic values (which
criticized China’s record on human rights), a competitor in important economic sectors, and,
finally, a bilateral relation already irritated by a few stories (including the Gui Minhai scandal).

With Sweden, Beijing sent a warning to other countries, especially in Europe. It was both
an opportunistic test and one of the symptoms of a broader trend that is now widespread
throughout the world.
Two affairs in particular were symptomatic of the lasting pressure Beijing exerts on Stockholm. On the one hand, there is the case of the Chinese tourists who were presumably violented by the Swedish police, an accusation instrumentalized by Chinese authorities to raise
accusations of human rights violations precisely when the Gui Minhai case reached its apex
and to develop a narrative presenting Sweden as a dangerous and decadent society. Soon after, a satirical Swedish TV show that drew inspiration from the accident provoked Beijing’s
ire (cyberattacks, harassment, intimidation). On the other hand, the case of Anna Lindstedt,
described as the “greatest diplomatic scandal in modern Sweden,” involved the Swedish ambassador in China (Anna Lindstedt) and the daughter of Gui Minhai. Overall, Beijing can
rely on numerous local relays in Sweden, such as associations affiliated to the UFWD or the
Schiller Institute.
Several elements in the Swedish case are symptomatic of a more widespread evolution, acknowledged in the present report, toward a Russification of Chinese influence operations. Using
varied narratives focalized on accidents, criminality, immigration, negative stories about Sweden
to instill the image of a violent and unstable society is precisely what Russian outlets have been
doing for years. Likewise, we note a convergence of views on Sweden among Chinese and Russian authorities and the U.S. alt-right, accompanied by cooperation with Swedish radical movements and parties. Even the choice of Gui Congyou as ambassador is less surprising that may be
thought at first sight: sent to Sweden, where Russia is particularly active, the Chinese ambassador
speaks Russian fluently and is a known expert on Russia. As such, this pro-Russian profile makes
sense if China means to get closer to Russia, learn from it, and even work with it on the informational operations that Moscow has long conducted in Sweden.
Canada has drawn Beijing’s interest for various reasons, none the least for its Chinese diaspora, which hosts a large number of proven or presumed dissidents. As in Australia, the Party-State
uses its entire repertoire of actions there. For a long time, and despite recurring CSIS alerts and
numerous cases published by the press, political resistance – in this case the propensity to see
Beijing as a partner rather than a threat – remained strong in Canada. Yet, people have begun to
awaken to the problem after 2018, due to several factors: the ripple effect of the Australian precedent (the similarity between the two countries prompted comparison) and above all the Huawei
affair, i.e., the brutal deterioration of the bilateral relationship following the arrest in Canada
of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer at the request of U.S. courts, to which Beijing immediately
responded by arresting two Canadians on its soil, without any justification (hostage diplomacy),
and by adopting trade sanctions.
One of the main goals for Chinese operations in Canada is to quiet dissidents. There are
many well-documented cases of harassment and intimidation of citizens and residents considered as dissidents or threats by Beijing. Beijing organizes (via WeChat usually) aggressive
counter-demonstrations, conducts harassment and intimidation campaigns against targeted
individuals, helped by fake accounts and doctored images, uses relatives and family members who stayed in China as levers. Besides, the country constantly monitors certain communities, most prominently ethnic minorities (including Uyghurs), conducts cyberattacks
against dissident groups and individuals, and usurps identities (attackers, for instance, sent
insulting emails to ministers and MPs pretending to be Falun Gong members to discredit
them). It also implements travel restrictions (Canadian activists were denied visas to China,
were arrested, detained, intimidated at Chinese airports, and forced to leave the country).
In any case, the goal remains the same: to censor dissenting voices. Beijing’s representatives
abroad, including its ambassador and consuls in Canada, are directly implicated in some
intimidation campaigns.

Furthermore, Beijing also tries to influence:
- Canadian politics, by approaching and coopting certain politicians (some MPs and ministers
at the federal level but most prominently local politicians, in British Columbia and Ontario
especially, where the largest communities of Chinese live). There were a few cases of electoral
interference too: the Chinese consulate in Toronto sent Chinese students to Chinese-speaking
homes to tell voters whom to vote for, and the consulate in Vancouver is regularly accused of
endorsing candidates of Chinese descent in the Richmond district, where a Chinese organization
once incited voters – via WeChat – to vote for specific candidates in exchange for money.
- Media outlets: almost all Canadian outlets in Chinese are controlled by the CCP, and the
Party-State uses both the carrot (encouraging newspapers to censor themselves in exchange of
trade advantages) and the stick (intimidation, threats, harassment, pressures on relatives in China,
ousting journalists who resist pressure, closing dissenting programs) against them. There were
also cases of information manipulation, especially through doctored translations.
- The educational system: in the universities first, including some that are relatively dependent
on Chinese students (like in Australia, but less prominently). Two types of problems need to be
considered separately: on the one hand, Beijing uses Canadian university programs in science
and technology to spy and steal technologies; and Canadian academics take part to dozens of
research projects with Chinese military universities. On the other hand, Beijing uses Canadian
universities to political ends, monitoring what is being said on campuses and surveilling the
dissidents that speak up. Some organizations have adopted a near-military discipline, sometimes
raising the flag and singing the Chinese national anthem on Canadian campuses, where Chinese
students do not hide their nationalism. There is also evidence of the involvement of Chinese
authorities (embassies and consulates) on Canadian campuses, especially through student associations (CSSAs). Then, secondary education has not been left untouched – with the opening
of Confucius Institutes especially. In that context, there are examples of restrictions of the
students’ freedom of speech, on topics tied to China: some teachers forbade discussions of the
Tian’anmen massacre and used maps that included Taiwan in China for instance.
Furthermore, there are cases of information manipulation, including forged letters sent on
behalf of the prime minister and minister of immigration in favor of a new “Tibetan” organization that was nothing but a façade used by Beijing to circulate its narrative on Tibet. Also,
WeChat is regularly criticized for its role in controlling persons and contents on campuses, organizing public counter-demonstrations, and in interfering with the electoral process. Chinese
services have used WeChat groups abroad to detect dissidents and harvest personal data. In one
case, the WeChat account of a Liberal minister was used against her will to collect money meant
to fund legal pursuits against a journalist critical of Beijing.
In Canada, the Party-State relies on hundreds of local organizations that are more or less affiliated to the UFWD (hence to the CCP). Each year, new organizations are created, in all areas
of life. Besides, Beijing is engaged in a strategy to seduce the First Nations, which may be used
to divide the Canadian society (with the narrative that “the two people must help each other to
fight marginalization and racism”). The example of the Musqueam, an autochthonous people
from the Vancouver region, is particularly interesting as some have Chinese ancestors. Hence,
Beijing’s efforts toward them are significant, but they are not the only targets.
Finally, as in the Swedish case, the Canadian example testifies to the Russification of Chinese influence operations. First, the Party-State does not stop at shaping the national debate on
China, censoring dissidents, the press, interfering in schools and universities, and so on. It also
criticizes the Canadian society and its government to try to divide the population. It exploits
several potentially divisive topics to alienate the Chinese community from its host country and,
ultimately, convince them that they are closer to Beijing than to Ottawa. The Huawei scandal also
provided Beijing with the opportunity to stir tensions between Canada and the United States,
circulating the idea that, contrary to appearances, it was really a problem between Canada and
the United States, not Canada and China; that Canada found itself inadvertently in the middle of

a Chinese-American cold war. Now, Chinese operations remain tied to the Chinese community
in Canada, but their progressive Russification indicates that they are increasingly “de-Sinicized,”
i.e. they have widened their reach from strictly communitarian questions to addressing societal
issues that affect all Canadians.
The last case study discussed the operation meant to redefine the coronavirus as U.S.made. The informational war launched by the CCP on the coronavirus had three components:
controlling the hemorrhage internally (emphasizing its efficient management of the crisis, and
flooding Chinese citizens with multiples, sometimes contradictory, counter-narratives); turning
the stigma over (demonetizing the critical voices heard in Western media and building a narrative presenting China at the bedside of the world – even when it implied manipulating facts and
information, such as in Italy); and discrediting adversaries (blaming the sanitary crisis on other
countries, especially on the United States). There lied the operation we nicknamed “Infektion
2.0,” for its similitudes with the KGB’s Infektion Operation conducted during the 1980s to make
people believe that Americans had created the AIDS virus.
The Chinese operation was deployed considerably faster in 2020, in a month (four years for
its Soviet version, between 1983 and 1987 – a difference due to the virality of social networks).
Early on, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was involved, relaying the theory that the virus
originated in the United States, not in China. It drew on the Canadian website globalresearch.
ca (known for its active role in the “conspirasphere” and as a relay of Russian campaigns of
disinformation) and on the articles published by “Larry Romanoff,” a retired Canadian settled
in Shanghai.
Beijing’s motivations may have been diverse: diverting the attention of the Chinese population to an evident scapegoat; then contributing indirectly to the perennity of the regime; helping
out the switch to a narrative that presented China as benevolent by disparaging the United States;
weakening the democratic model of governance by circulating the narrative of a “good” Chinese
management of the sanitary crisis, etc. This operation successfully confirmed the Russification/
sovietization of Chinese methods of disinformation as they followed, almost to the letter, the
steps of the KGB’s operations: a prompt reaction; a story so difficult to conceive that it could
only be true; based on enough truthful evidence to be believable; in which China’s role was hidden; with the help of some useful idiots. Lastly, like the Soviets, Beijing denied any involvement.

CONCLUSION
A MACHIAVELLIAN MOMENT

In the 17th chapter of The Prince (1532), Machiavel asked “whether it is better to be loved
than to be feared or the contrary,” to which he answered that “it is much safer to be feared
than to be loved.”1 This posture has most famously been associated with Russia – particularly with President Putin2 – rather than with China. For a long time, it was said that
China tried to be loved rather than to be feared: the country wanted to seduce, to project a positive image of itself onto the world, and to provoke admiration. We did write, in an
article comparing China and Russia in January 2020, that “China is more preoccupied with
its moral image (respectability) on the international stage, being a good global citizen,” and
that it was, as such, “more reluctant to use certain methods potentially presenting a greater
reputational risk.” Russia, on the other hand, “not only cares less about its reputation (it
has less to offer but also less to lose), it actually cultivates the image of a strong state using
security and military with audacity”3 to denigrate its adversaries and impair their power of
attraction. This is at least the Russian interpretation of the soft power (мягкая сила).4 Now,
the difference between China and Russia has become thinner.
Obviously, China has not renounced its strategy of “seducing and subjugating”
(→ p. 147), its attractiveness, or its ambition to model international norms. The CCP
remains careful not to “lose face” (丢脸-丢面子) and to avoid damaging its image in many
domains. For that reason, the Chinese ethos has not become Russian. However, at the same
time, Beijing is more and more comfortable with “infiltrating and constraining”
(→ p. 161). Undeniably, as shown in the hundreds of pages in this report, its influence
operations have grown considerably tougher in recent years, and they have come to
resemble Moscow’s more and more closely. The reasons behind the aggressive turn of
Chinese diplomacy (which started before the Covid-19 pandemic) are revealing: ambassadors are now primarily targeting Beijing, they are in a zealous race to win favors (→ p. 239).
For Beijing, defending the Party has become more important than winning the hearts
and minds of foreign populations which, in any case, are already constrained by China’s

economic might. In other words, the CCP demonstrates a will to arouse not only admiration, but also fear. And this is precisely for that reason, – because the Party now seems
convinced that “it is safer to be feared than to be loved” – that it can be said to have
entered, since 2017 or so, into a “Machiavellian moment”5, the main symptom of
which is the increasing Russification of Chinese operations.

I. The Russification of Chinese influence operations
Despite their common ideological matrix, significant skills transfers from the USSR
to Maoist China (at least until the early 1950s), and jointly-led operations,6 China’s
informational strategies have long remained different from its vast neighbor’s. For
instance, Beijing has always seemed to cherish its international image, which meant usually (but not always) opting for the diffusion of positive messages about itself – whereas
Moscow took on the image of the spoilsport, stirring up social, political, ethnic, or religious conflicts in targeted countries. Furthermore, Beijing’s operations mostly focused
on Chinese diasporas throughout the world whereas Russia had more general and diverse
targets. Finally, and that was the major difference for the past twenty years, the PRC’s
power allowed it to wield its influence without having to systematically use secret operations, while Russia’s endemic weakness renders the asymmetric weapon of informational
operations more necessary.
Yet, we suggested in January 20207 that a Russification of Chinese operations was
underway. It wasn’t a novel idea: the Russification of Chinese operations – or at least borrowings from Russian tactics – has been discussed for years. A parallel was drawn, for
instance, during the 2018 municipal elections in Taiwan, which were targeted by “a
Russia-style influence campaign.”8 At the time, it already alerted some observers; in the
columns of The Washington Post, for instance, Josh Rogin wrote a premonitory assessment:
“the fact that Beijing is using Russian-style political interference tools should prompt a
full-scale national security alarm. The capabilities Beijing is honing in Taiwan could do
huge damage if applied to the United States. China is testing them on a country it knows
well but preparing for their use around the world.”9 Indeed, Beijing had tested tactics in its
regional environment before it began implementing them globally (→ p. 626), exactly what
Moscow had done a few years earlier. In 2019, this assessment was updated, and the
fears renewed, during the operations that targeted Hong Kong. And this is in 2020,
during the Covid-19 pandemic, that the world finally took notice of the problem.
Initially, Chinese media outlets covered the pandemic in a rather positive manner, in
that it highlighted Chinese efforts. Then, as Western countries were affected and China
increasingly blamed, they adopted a more offensive stance that integrated a negative cov5. Hence, our “Machiavellian moment” does not refer to the debate on the republican interpretation of Machiavelli
(on this: John Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition (Paris: PUF,
1975); Claude Lefort, Le travail de l’œuvre Machiavel (The Work on Machiavelli’s Writing) (Paris: Gallimard, 1986); Quentin
Skinner and Maurizio Viroli, eds., Machiavelli and Republicanism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).

of US Biological Warfare from the Korean War to COVID-19,” Center for Advanced China Research (1 Apr. 2020).

erage of the management of the crisis by other countries. Hence, comparing models, it
used the pandemic as an illustration of the apparently chaotic and inefficient democratic
model of government. While using different tactics (“from promoting conspiracy websites to the use of trolls and bot networks to pushing false narratives couched in science
on Chinese state media”), “Beijing [engaged] in an aggressive information campaign
to try and reshape the global narrative around COVID. [It did] this in attempt to
make the world see China as the global leader in the response rather than the source of
the pandemic.”10
The tactics employed by the Chinese government in these successive episodes
– coordination between diplomats and state media, use of Western social networks, systematic attempt to discredit Western media, cooptation of conspiracy outlets, clandestine
operations on social networks etc. – led the ASPI to write that “the CCP’s propaganda
apparatus has been watching the tactics and impact of Russian disinformation.”11
The Global Engagement Center of the U.S. State Department noted the same thing: “we’re
seeing the CCP adopt Russian-style tactics.”12 And a growing number of publications from
all over the world have stressed it: the Russification of Chinese operations is now
widely recognized.
That said, discussing the “Russification” of Chinese operations does not imply that
there is one coherent and homogenous Russian approach. With Camille François, we
can regret that observers are too quick in recognizing a “Russian playbook” when it “is akin
to a Russian salad: not very Russian, and with different ingredients every time.”13 Russian
actors are actually diverse and not all tied to state structures; they experiment and adapt
themselves along the way, keeping and improving the recipes that worked. Ultimately, they
are certainly not the only ones using those tactics. And yet, these are often described and
investigated – rightly or wrongly – as being “Russians.”
Concretely, the Russification of Chinese operations accounts for three elements that
are described in the following pages: Beijing draws from Moscow in several ways, but
differences remain between them. Interestingly, there is also a degree of cooperation.

A. Russian inspiration
For attentive observers of influence operations, it is now evident that “China has been
studying Russian activities for quite a number of years and learning from its experiences.
They are getting better than the Russians in many ways.”14 The PLA, for instance, explicitly
endorsed this “model”.15

For the PLA: Russia is a model to emulate
For its experience manipulating social networks, at least since the annexation of
Crimea in 2014 (closely followed in China, by the PLA notably), Russia “provided China
with a model to emulate.”16 In 2014, a member of the PLA General Staff Department
wrote an article drawing three lessons from the “war on [the Russian] public opinion”
in Ukraine:17 “take the offensive by pushing your narrative first, present legal arguments, and back it up with hard power”18 Several similar articles were published afterward, which testified to a clear willingness, on the part of the Chinese military, to learn
from the Russian precedent.19
In 2018, an article investigating RT’s coverage of the American bombings in Syria recommended an “investigation of RT’s communication methods [:] without losing its ‘objectivity,’ we can silently influence the emotions and inclinations of the public and make it more
dependent on information from our media outlets.”20 RT has regularly been quoted as a
model to emulate in publications of the Chinese military, especially for its activities on
social networks. Indeed, analysts from the PLA National Defense University compared the
Russian channel to “a propaganda aircraft carrier,” stressing its performance on YouTube.21
Another article published in 2018 insisted on “RT’s value for disinformation, reflecting a shift
in the PLA’s discussion of offensive uses of social media.”22-23 Actually, it was the first “positive and detailed evaluation”24 of the Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential
campaign. The article highlighted how “Russia’s bots improved the effectiveness and lowered
the costs of propaganda, and that RT spread disinformation on social media to confuse people.”25 Several months later, another article showed admiration for the way RT exploited
divisions within Western societies, suggesting China should do the same: “we can also
make full use of the latent contradictions between different countries and the influence of opposition factions within Western countries to prevent enemies from coming together to form
an anti-China front, and to emphasize how its interminable conflicts and difficulty in reaching
consensus contrast with our unity.”26

Before assessing to what extent Moscow might have inspired Beijing, we need to emphasize that they have mutually inspired each other. On some elements, Moscow is actually taking cues from Beijing. This is the case, for instance, of the policies targeting the
diaspora. “The second-biggest diaspora in the world, after the Chinese,”27 is the Russian,
and they both adopted a similarly wide and homogenous conception of the diaspora.
Indeed, the manner Beijing conceives “overseas Chinese,” both its nationals but also people of Chinese descent whatever their citizenship may be (ethnic nationalism → p. 165),
is similar to the way Russia perceives its “compatriots abroad”: not solely the Russians
strictly speaking, but also Russian speakers that share a common history and culture. As
Mikhail Suslov noted, “the Russian diaspora is not a diaspora in the strict sense, and nor is
it ‘Russian.’ This ‘Russian’ diaspora is in fact a post-Soviet diaspora, its homeland no longer
in existence.”28 In both cases, the extension of the “subjects” over which these states claim,
if not sovereignty, at least some form of control, is very broad. They also tend to conceive
these diasporas as a homogeneous bloc, which is obviously not the case, primarily because
they include a significant proportion of dissidents. In any case, the regimes try to homogenize them, with varying degrees of effectiveness. In that case, Russia is actually doing
less well than China. Indeed, “the Russian political elite has been aware of the potential
of the ‘Russian compatriots,’ but at the same time its ways of relating to them are awkward
and confusing.”29 Here, Russia is the one taking heeds from China, as the president of the
French Coordination Council of Russian Compatriots admitted.30
Now, Beijing emulates the Russians in a number of ways:
• 1) In leading clandestine informational operations on Western social networks
(Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), using trolls, fake accounts, and bots. Freedom House
noted that one of the main evolutions of the Chinese informational operations
since 2017 has been the development of “Russian-style social media disinformation campaigns.”31 They seemingly debuted “as early as mid-2017” (the earliest such
operation was presumably launched in April 2017)32 and grew more intense in 2019 when
the Chinese government extended those methods to Western platforms: “[until] the 2019
protests in Hong Kong, most evidence of Chinese computational propaganda occurred
on domestic platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, and QQ. But China’s new-found interest
in aggressively using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube should raise concerns for democracies.”33 The 2019 campaign in Hong Kong was a test: “Beijing began experimenting

with covert information operations on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, using false personas and pages that aimed to discredit the protesters by portraying them as violent.”34
Since 2019 (Hong Kong), and especially 2020 (pandemic), a consensus has emerged
to recognize that China is engaged in aggressive and clandestine “Russian-style”
campaigns. Since 2020, many investigations have shown “that pro-Beijing actors are
carrying out a whole range of covert activities in multiple countries and languages. The
campaigns aim to spread proven falsehoods, sow societal discord and panic, manipulate perceptions of public opinion, or undermine the democratic process.”35 As for
now, these campaigns have mostly targeted China’s near abroad (Taiwan, Hong
Kong), Australia and the United States. From this perspective, Europeans – who are
battered by more visible Russian campaigns36 – may still be underestimating the threat
of Chinese information manipulations. And yet, it is obvious that, without matching the
intensity and sophistication of Russian efforts, China is bound to develop its operations
targeting Europe or a European country in the informational domain.
• 2) In investing massively, openly, and aggressively in social networks, as illustrated by the “Twitterization” of diplomats participating in the “wolf warrior diplomacy” – something Russian authorities were already doing.
• 3) In widening the reach of warfare beyond the sole diasporas. Traditionally – and
this was a classical difference between the approach of Beijing and Moscow – the United
Front concentrated its efforts on monitoring and surveilling overseas Chinese in Western
countries, i.e. suppressing dissidents, constructing the narrative circulated in Chineselanguage media outlets, and mobilizing the largest possible number of individuals to act
in conformity with the Party’s interests. However, during the last decade (2010-2020), the
targets of the United Front have expanded to include, among others, the non-Chinese
political, entrepreneurial, media and academic elites of targeted countries, as noted in
the online version of the People’s Daily: the main targets have been “individuals who are
representative due to their political influence, economic power, social position,
and high academic status, as well leaders of communities.”37
The extension of the domain of struggle is particularly visible in the media landscape,
where Beijing has evolved from a focus on international outlets in China and its immediate environment (Hong Kong, Taiwan) ten years ago to an attempt at influencing
and censoring media outlets everywhere in the world nowadays. It has used, especially after 2017, “tactics that were once used primarily to co-opt Chinese diaspora
media and suppress critical coverage in overseas Chinese-language publications are
now being applied – with some effect – to local mainstream media in various countries.”38

• 4) In switching from a positive narrative on itself to a negative narrative on the
others. Beijing’s objective is no longer solely to promote a positive narrative and to prevent the circulation of negative representations on China: in Italy and Serbia during the
pandemic, for instance (→ p. 591), a critical (and, in that case, unwarranted) narrative on
the EU was added. In fact, we observe more and more cases where Beijing is “seeking
to manipulate conversations even on topics not directly related to China,”39 which
is a recent development. The Party-State is acting gradually, blurring the line between
its defensive and offensive objectives.40 It is not always easy to understand when the
country is defending itself and when it is being offensive, contrary to the Kremlin, which
endorses more openly the offensive character of its operations. In any case, Beijing is
“seeing the need not just to defend its own system publicly but to unleash open criticism
of ’western democracy’ through its officials and propaganda machinery rather than confining this language to internal Party documents and speeches.”41
• 5) In trying to divide and sow discord in target countries, as illustrated by the several
operations launched against the United States, including a campaign of text messages
meant to create a panic in March 2020 (→ p. 392). On that matter, “American officials
said China, borrowing from Russia’s strategies, has been trying to widen political divisions in the United States.”42 The United States is no exception: other examples in this
report highlighted how Beijing tried to divide Canada, Europe, South Korea or Japan. In
trying to seduce discontent individuals, those who believe they have been left on the
sidelines – such as Canadian First Nations (→ p. 583) or separatist movements, in Japan
for instance (→ p. 401) –, Beijing has adopted a method commonly used by Moscow,
which has not refrained from endorsing protesters in some countries (the Yellow Vests
in France for instance).43
In a previous report, we noted that the divisions used by Moscow were not only internal to a country (to fracture its society) but also external, stirring up tensions between
neighboring states and allies.44 Several examples in this report showed that Beijing has
also tried to divide Europe, the transatlantic relation, and the U.S.-Canadian relationship, among others.
• 6) In interfering with elections. As noted earlier (→ p. 268), China interfered in at
least a dozen elections in Asia, Australasia, and in North America. In the United States,
APT31, also known as Zirconium, a group of hackers backed by the Chinese state, tried
to penetrate the emails of the Biden campaign in a manner (fishing) similar to
the hack that allowed GRU officers to conduct the DNC Leaks operation against

Hillary Clinton four years earlier.45 Here, China follows Russia’s lead, seemingly positioning itself as a copycat – even though it would not go as far because, as usual, it hacks
but does not leak. A report of the National Intelligence Council (NIC) stated that, contrary to Russia, Beijing did not try to interfere or to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential
election for different reasons, including the fact that opposition to Beijing is bipartisan
in Washington – there was no pro-China option in the electoral field. That said, in the
same report, the officer dealing with cyber questions added a “minority opinion” according to which Beijing still tried to harm the Trump candidacy through actions on social
networks and in the media, but “calibrated its influence efforts to avoid blowback” in a
manner that still qualified as “electoral influence.”46
• 7) In circulating conspiracy theories, via official (diplomatic) channels for instance,
as was saw during the Covid-19 pandemic. An article published in a PLA magazine in
2018 suggested that conspiracy theories should be spread out in Western media outlets
if China were to be losing the battle for public opinions. According to its author, a student from the department of public opinion warfare at the National Defense University,
Beijing “should cultivate a group of media outlets and think tanks having a
small ‘grey’ audience to spread lies and create a database of negative topics and
conspiracy theories.”47 Doing so, it should focus more particularly on “targeting the
younger Western audiences’ distrust of mainstream media, politicians, and even values.”48 Likewise, it could use “official channels to amplify conspiracy theories and to
sow doubt about established facts in the context of major political events […], a tactic
often used by Moscow.”49 “China’s recent promotion of known conspiracy websites is
another move taken from the Russian playbook.”50
• 8) In using its near abroad as a testing ground before launching operations worldwide: Moscow tested its methods during the color revolutions of the mid-2000s, in Georgia
(2008), and Ukraine (2014), before it turned them against Western democracies. Similarly,
Beijing started its operations in Taiwan and Hong Kong before widening their reach globally, including in (but not limited to) Australia, Canada, the United States and Europe.
From Argentina to Denmark, everyone can see a globalization of Chinese operations.
• 9) In subcontracting portions of its informational operations to intermediaries.
The frequent use, on the Chinese side, of content farms (→ p. 367) that are outsourced
in Malaysia or elsewhere echoes the Russian troll farms, some of which are based abroad
(such as the troll farm uncovered by Graphika in the suburbs of Accra, in Ghana).51
• 10) In moving closer to political radicals. The ties between the Chinese embassy
in Sweden, the nationalist far-right party Alternativ för Sverige and the Schiller Institute

(with its sulfurous reputation) startled observers. The same occurred in France when the
CCP-affiliated People Daily used Damien Viguier to discredit the coverage of China by Le
Monde. Viguier, who had been condemned for his denial of crimes against humanity,52
is the lawyer of the far-right ideologist Alain Soral.53 Likewise, Egalité et réconciliation, the
association founded by Alain Soral, relayed the Chinese conspiracy theory according to
which the coronavirus would have its origin in the American laboratory of Fort Detrick
(→ p. 589).54 Last but not least, the Chinese embassy in Paris promoted a book on Uyghurs
written by the far-left administrator of a website that has “repeatedly relayed conspiracy
theories” (→ p. 335).55 Examples elsewhere are legions, such as in Italy where Beijing has
grown closer to the far-right.56 According to an April 2021 report from the Soufan Center,
as of March 2020 China was the state actor “most involved in amplifying QAnon
narratives on Facebook,” ahead of Russia. Between January 1 and February 28, 2021,
for example, 58% of QAnon posts on Facebook would have originated in China, while
less than half would have originated in Russia. The report concludes that “China’s goal,
most likely, is to sow further discord and division among the American population.”57 If
the precise data is to be taken cautiously, as the methodology of the report has been questioned (the exact origin of the operators of the Facebook accounts involved are unverifiable except by Facebook itself58) the very involvement of Chinese state actors in the
amplification of QAnon stories remains plausible. Facebook, like Twitter and Google, has
reported manipulations of Chinese origin on several occasions and, as we have seen, some
of these manipulations were indeed aimed at increasing divisions within the U.S. society.
This relatively new tendency is another symptom of the Russification of Chinese attitudes
(and diplomatic practice) as the country no longer refrains from displaying itself with local
extremes, something Russia has done for a long time.
Yet, the motivations are different: in general, people aligning themselves with China
are motivated by financial gains, more than by a convergence of views or interests; while Russia benefits from a genuine ideological proximity with those groups
(pro-traditions, pro-sovereignty, anti-European feelings, etc.). That said, China’s conduct
in the Xinjiang – putting a million Muslims in concentration camps as part of an ethnic
cleansing or even genocide – may seduce some far-right fringes.
Some anti-Semitic signals in the Chinese discourse must probably be interpreted in
the context of this rapprochement with the political extremes. Not only some of the
relays of this discourse have been notoriously conspiratorial and anti-Semitic websites,
such as the one Larry Romanoff had as early as 2010 (→ p. 608); but some Chinese
diplomats, journalists and influencers have recently made some disturbing references.

caricature (see below) that has largely been interpreted as conspiratorial and anti-Semitic
(the Israeli flag on the scythe of Death seemed to imply that the Israeli-American alliance sawed death in a number of countries and, here, in Hong Kong) before it deleted
the message and claimed its account had been “falsified.” The explanation did not convince anyone because, as Antoine Bondaz noted, the caricature continued to be “liked”
by the Embassy’s account (not to mention that it was republished in April 2021, by the
account of the Chinese embassy in Japan this time, before being deleted again – see
image below).59 Another example was also caught by Antoine Bondaz: on March 23,
2021, the journalist and writer Zheng Ruolin (郑若麟) – and “old friend” of Maxime
Vivas (→ p. 335)60 – attacked the French MEP Raphaël Glucksmann on Weibo, highlighting that “his whole family was Jewish,” with an image on which the star of David
was added (Glucksmann was also deemed responsible of the death of Samuel Paty,
the French teacher who was beheaded by an islamist terrorist, because he had presumably “attracted Chechen refugees to France and […] a Chechen terrorist decapitated the
French professor” – see the image below).

finance and the media, and the Japanese invaders of the small islands, cannot imagine
what each of us, a member of the Chinese nation, is willing to consent to in order to contribute to the rebirth of this country, and how much we have accepted humiliation for so
many years, only to recover the glory of our most illustrious forefathers.”62 In May 2021,
it was CGTN’s star presenter Zheng Junfeng who drew the ire of the Israeli authorities
for explaining U.S. support for Israel by the power of Jewish lobbies in the country.63
The Israeli embassy in China reacted by saying that it showed “blatant anti-Semitism.”64
These examples are so far isolated, and nothing indicates a more widespread tendency:
China is possibly using all the levers in its hands against its enemies, in an uninhibited
discourse that no longer forbids itself anything. Yet, this lever could find an echo in several anti-Semitic groups in Russia, in Europe, or in North America for instance.

• 11) In instrumentalizing the terrorist specter in discussing Uyghurs. It brandishes
the terrorist threat, but also the myth of a happy population (Chinese media circulate
many images of the happy daily life in Xinjiang), and attacks against the presumably
ignorant, lying, and interfering Western outlets – all of which “reflect many classic elements of Russian disinformation with a uniquely Chinese twist.”65
• 12) In using “gangster methods.” The examples of pressure, intimidations, aggressions, arbitrary arrests, kidnappings, breaks in, hackings, sabotages that are described in
this report show that Beijing is willing to use “gangster methods,”66 in sharp contrast to
the ethos that it apparently hoped to project on the international scene – a benevolent and
pacific power – and in an attitude which is closer to the brutal image that never really
bothered Moscow.

Hence, to discredit “the West,” it is now obvious that Beijing has adopted the Russian
approach that Ben Nimmo summed up in 2015 as the “4Ds:”67 dismiss (“If you do not
like what your critics say, insult them”), distort (“If you do not like the facts, twist them”),
distract (“If you’re accused of something, accuse someone else of the same thing”68), and
dismay (“If you do not like what someone else is planning, scare them off.”).69
Unlike Russia, China has often been described as refraining from using aggressive disinformation campaigns targeting the divisions of a society, and also as not
having a global field of intervention (only a regional sphere).70 These two elements
were the two missing pieces of a hybrid arsenal, according to the infographics of the
Ukrainian Crisis Media Center (below). But if it was true a few years ago, this is no longer
the case today, as this report shows. China now checks the two elements. In fact, it
checks all of them: China has the most comprehensive arsenal of any country.

Finally, the Russification may also be partly a Sovietization. In other words, it could
reach beyond information manipulation on social networks to a return to tradition as a
way to counter more and more frequent detections (as shown in the exponential growth
of reports on Chinese operations). Like the jihadists who use short waves to prevent the
interception of their (GSM or satellite) phone communications, the more observers scrutinize and denounce Chinese actions on social networks and on the Internet, the more China
could be tempted to implement disinformation on other channels. To do that, the repertoire of actions elaborated by the KGB’s Service A constitutes a precious source of inspiration for the Chinese preparing influence operations. Bound to grow in the years ahead,
this tendency is well illustrated by the operation that we named “Infektion 2.0” which subtly
mixes disinformation on social networks and controlling front organizations.

B. Some differences subsist
• 1) China has a more complete toolkit, not only because its own platforms (WeChat,
Weibo, TikTok) are used worldwide, while the Russians rely on U.S. platforms (Facebook,
Twitter, and Instagram), but also because it has real “offline” influence: “China’s online
activities frequently support offline influence operations that make extensive use of
in-person networks of human agents of influence, overtly attributed state media in
English and other non-Chinese languages, and ‘grey propaganda’ with less obviously
attributable ties to the mainland. This robust and well-resourced collection of tools
should equip China to execute integrated influence operations on a scale that Russia
cannot match.”71 Generally speaking, Beijing has many more levers than Moscow, in
particular economic ones.
• 2) China also benefits from a plethoric workforce. “Russians still rely very much
on bots, so its computers, and zombie computers that are propagating disinformation,
whereas the Chinese still seem to be using human beings, which means that the content
can react more quickly to situations. All of that is probably also augmented by cyborgs,
so basically the original information is generated by human beings, and then it is spread
by computer systems, and all that, so to saturate the environment, but one thing is sure,
is that China has a lot more people that can produce disinformation content than Russia
does.”72 This comparative advantage is however countered by the growing use
of artificial intelligence in informational operations, including in the production of
content.
• 3) Still, Russian information manipulations are more sophisticated. The Chinese
operations that have targeted Western social networks after 2017 are impressive by their
sheer number but usually hastened and of poor quality, hence easier to notice. Russians,
on the contrary, are more meticulous and have a more precise knowledge of local
media ecosystems and public opinions. Like KGB officers before them, Russians
“do ethnographic research (IRA operatives toured the United States) and ingratiate
themselves into the communities they are pretending to be members of (e.g., Black
Lives Matter activists or Texas secessionists). They put in effort to build relationships
with influencers, to ensure that authentic influential voices amplify their content.”73 The
Chinese generally learn languages but not cultures, and they lack of adaptive
capacity: “we see young people speaking the language fairly well but showing really
inappropriate behaviors,” a Swedish interlocutor told us.74 Yet, it appears that in Middle
Eastern countries (especially in Gulf states and in Algeria), Chinese diplomats not only
speak the language quite well – in both its classical and dialectal forms – but also have a
precise knowledge of local cultures.75
• 4) Russia better integrates cyber with the rest: its cyberoperations are conceived
as parts of wider campaigns of influence (such as hack-and-leak). They are used in a
sequence that brings in intelligence services, but also media outlets, as we have seen over

the years, especially with the DNC Leaks and the Macron Leaks.76 Beijing, however, segments its operations (cyber on one side, then the rest): Chinese cyberoperations are
numerous and sophisticated, but they are not (yet) integrated into wider informational operations despite knowing that several actors, such the MSS, have come
to master the entire process. The fusion ultimately looms ahead if the Russification
continues.
• 5) China still believes in the attractiveness of its model. As they attack Westerners,
Chinese media outlets are still mainly focused on promoting China and its model of
governance. CGTN and Xinhua do not behave like RT and Sputnik. China talks a lot
more about itself than Russia does: more than 50% of the content circulated on the
YouTube channels of CGTN and CCTV focus on China, compared to only 4% of the
content released on the YouTube channels of RT America and RT UK dealing with
Russia.77 RT France’s website does not have a Russian news tab, for example, while that
of CGTN Français even places the “China” tab first on its toolbar. In a word, Chinese
outlets are ego-centered.
• 6) Consequently, the differences are not playing in China’s favor: Russian media are
better implanted in their local ecosystems, their websites receive a lot more visits, and their profiles on social networks more engagement because they deal with
French topics in the French context, for instance, and with divisive issues (unemployment, demonstrations, crimes, immigration etc.). Chinese platforms, however, usually
speak about China in France, which is less interesting to many readers. In other words,
China stands far above Russia in its artificially high number of followers on social
networks but the Russians are more efficient, more convincing. Thus, they have
comparatively more impact on social networks. It does not seem to be a Chinese priority however: they want to “demonstrate to superiors total commitment by generating
high levels of activity […] while actual efficacy or impact may be secondary.”78 As such,
the disciplinary campaign marshaled by Xi Jinping probably reinforced the propensity
of actors on the field to favor quantitative operations at the expense of real success.
Obviously, they may figure that out and make their future operations more subtle, thus
less detectable and more influential.
To sum up, Beijing has an advantage in several domains, Moscow in others, and it can
be said that “China copied Russia’s tactics […]. But it lacks Russia’s skillset.”79 It
does not mean, however, that one is less dangerous than the others, none the least because
China’s room for improvement is considerable. Furthermore, we should not confuse the
whole with the part: the Russian superiority on information manipulation is evident,
but when we account for all influence operations, the reverse is true. First, Beijing follows the same tradition (communist techniques refined all through the 20th century) and the
country is on a path to acquire the same expertise, perhaps even a better one in some areas.
Also, China’s economic might and the attractiveness of its internal market means that it is
harder to say no to. Finally, the country is both more subtle and apparently innocuous in

its operations. What To wrote about the efforts directed at overseas Chinese, the qiaowu (侨
务) – i.e. “an effective tool for intensive behavioral control and manipulation, yet appearing
benign, benevolent, and helpful”80 – can apply to the entire effort of the United Front, and
to most Chinese influence operations. Finally, as Ryan Fedasiuk noted, “if the past twenty
years are any indication, foreigners should expect the CCP’s influence operations to
continue growing in size and sophistication.”81 The Party-State learns fast and it can
enjoy considerable resources at its disposal.

C. Cooperation
The Sino-Russian – or, more accurately, Sino-Soviet – cooperation on information manipulation is not a new phenomenon. When, in 1949-1950, Soviet propaganda
accused the United States of testing biological weapons on the Inuit populations of Alaska,
this fake information was relayed by Chinese state propaganda, which asserted that the
United States was then collaborating with the former chief of the Japanese program on biological weapons, and ready to use these weapons against China. In 1952, during the Korean
War, the Soviets in turn relayed a Chinese and North Korean disinformation campaign
averring that the United States was conducting a bacteriological war by airlifting insects
infected with microorganisms carrying diseases such as the plague and cholera. Together
with the Soviets, they doctored the evidence by creating two fake zones of contamination.82
Nowadays, the Sino-Russian relationship is growing stronger. For more than a decade,
the two powers have continuously come closer as the distance with the United States
widens. After 2014, the fallout of the annexation of Crimea and of the Donbass War – that
is, the rupture with Europe – contributed to reinforcing the partnership between Moscow
and Beijing. More recently, the Covid-19 pandemic gave the impression of a “united front”
in defense of the authoritarian model of crisis management to counter presumably inefficient, even chaotic, liberal democracies, as described by the media of the two countries.
Although specialists have repeatedly emphasized the fragility, or at least the somewhat artificial and unsustainable nature of this profoundly asymmetrical agreement – the gap having
widened between the two – the fact remains that in the field of influence operations, and
more precisely in the informational sub-field, the two powers are undertaking a clear rapprochement.
• 1) Media cooperation. An annual Russia-China Media Forum debuted in 2015,
during which dozens of contracts are signed between media outlets from both countries. In 2017, Sputnik signed cooperation agreements with Xinhua, the Guangdong
radio and TV channels,83 and the Global Times;84 while Rossia Segodnia (RS, overseeing
RT and Sputnik) partnered with Alibaba Culture Communication.85 In 2018, RS and

China Media Group (CMG, controlling CGTN and RCI) signed a strategic cooperation agreement to officially develop common content (documentaries, news reports)
and promote each other’s national content on their respective platforms. They
also set up a platform to release content translated from Russian or Chinese and produced by media in each countries (www.sinorusfocus.com). In 2019, agreements were
signed between RS and Huawei,86 and again between Sputnik and Xinhua (to share
content in Spanish and Arabic this time).87 An agreement with Roskomnadzor – the
Russian regulatory authority in charge of media and communications – granted a cable
and digital broadcasting license to the Russian version of CGTN, another type of
decision made at this event. At the Russian political level, the vice-minister of Digital
Development and Mass Communications, Alexei Voline, seems to be shepherding the
negotiations.
Besides, several Chinese journalists are invited every year to the Russian Young
Leaders program, “Новое поколение” (New Generation), organized by the agency
Rossotrudnichestvo, in cooperation with Sputnik. These are master classes where RS
employees train individuals to the “Russian methods of international journalism pertaining to media production and social network uses.”88
This rapprochement is motivated by a shared belief in the competitiveness of the international mediatic field, and in the necessity – for Russian and Chinese outlets – to ally
themselves in the face of Western heavyweights (notably CNN and the BBC) and
offer an “alternative” editorial line. During the state visit of Xi Jinping in Moscow, in July
2017, RT’s editor-in-chief Margarita Simonian intervened in front of both heads of state
at the Kremlin: she endorsed the framework of an “informational war” and asked them
to increase cooperation between Russian and Chinese outlets to ensure “the survival of
our resources […] in the face of the powerful Western mainstream journalism.”89 One
RT employee interviewed by the researcher Maxime Audinet in 2015 even admitted that
several producers and journalist from CCTV came to observe the editorial methods of the Russian channel and the construction of its pretended “alternative”
editorial line, which is both incisive and very offensive toward the West (during the
Ukrainian crisis in particular).90
In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic provided another reason to call for a deeper cooperation between Chinese and Russian media to form a common front against critics.
For instance, during the 2020 China-Russia Online Media Webinar, which took place
on December 18, 2020, Niu Yibing, the Deputy-Director of the Office of the Central
Cyberspace Affairs Commission (中央网络安全和信息化委员会), called on Russian
and Chinese media to “work together to tell more vivid stories about the fight against
the pandemic, jointly fight against attacks and provocations from Western countries.”91

a thirty-minute documentary untitled “Hong Kong Unmasked,” which concluded that
the U.S. government had intervened in the crisis through think tanks, NGOs, and state

29, and viewed more than 100,000 times before being abundantly relayed on Weibo and

apparently “circular” fashion.96 “Since November 2019, three of the top five most
retweeted news outlets (not including China’s state-backed media), were funded by the
Iranian or Russian governments. PressTV, RT, and SputnikNews were the third, fourth,
and fifth most retweeted outlets.”97 “So we saw that in Italy, we saw Russian-linked
social media accounts were amplifying content that was promoting pro-Chinese
narratives. So, tweets, for example, from China’s MFA and the Global Times to Italian
audiences.”98 Russian intelligence services (GRU) may have contributed to amplifying
manipulated information on the coronavirus, more specifically in circulating the Chinese
conspiracy theory on the American origin of the virus.99
• 3) Cooperation in the “fight against disinformation.” In September 2020, the
spokeswoman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the minister
and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, had reached “an important consensus on
the fight against disinformation.” She denounced the countries that, “in the context of
the Covid-19,” were circulating disinformation and invited them “to respect the facts.”

Because Russia and China are largely seen, by the rest of the world as two of the largest
producers of disinformation, this announcement provoked many ironic comments. But
for attentive observers of influence operations, it was perceived as an avowed sign of
cooperation in the field, not to “fight” disinformation, but to produce it. This is
also suggested by the Chinese use of narrative materials usually adopted by the Russians.

Thus, after the publication by the Jyllands-Posten of caricatures of the PRC flag, Chinese
Internet users (including the Diba group) mocked the “weakness” of the Danes, who
were only able to resist the German invasion for 4 hours on 9 April 1940, which is a
recurring argument in Russian disinformation campaigns.100 The presence of this “reference” in Chinese campaign makes it possible to suppose that the two countries practice
transfers of competences.
• 4) The use of common relays. As a consequence of the fact that, as we have seen, the
Party-State no longer hesitates to keep company with the political extremes (→ p. 626), it
frequently draws from the same sources as Moscow. Most of its anti-American relays
are known to be, correlatively, pro-Russian. For example, in order to deny the oppression
of Uyghurs, to discredit the German researcher Adrian Zenz,101 or to deny the Chinese origin of the coronavirus, Chinese authorities readily rely on Max Blumenthal, an American
journalist, and his site The Grayzone, which are cited by the Chinese press as well as by
the spokespersons of the Foreign Ministry.102-103 An article by Blumenthal published in The
Grayzone on February 18, 2021 was relayed on Twitter by Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by CGTN, which gave an interview to Blumenthal for the
occasion, and by a number of embassies. Some even reproduced the article in its entirety
on their websites.104 However, Blumenthal, who founded his site one month after a trip to
Moscow for the tenth anniversary of RT, was until then known mainly for being a relay of
Russian propaganda (and an advocate for Bashar al-Assad).105 His site The Grayzone was
also cited by the spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry.106 He is now one of the
many common sources of Beijing and Moscow.
• 5) Cooperation between security services? We can suppose – without concrete
evidence however – that media outlets and diplomats from both countries are not the
only ones cooperating on influence operations (which they call operations of counter-influence) and that their armed forces and intelligences services, for instance, are
also exchanging information, and perhaps “good practices,” when their common objective is to weaken and divide liberal democracies. It is all the more logical to assume it
that cooperation between intelligence services already exists through the Shanghai

Cooperation Organization (tasked with fighting terrorist threats and illegal drug trafficking for instance). What is certain, as the Chinese military publications demonstrate, is
that there is at least a Chinese interest in Russian tactics and, as the Chinese grow more
powerful, probably a reciprocal interest on the Russian side for Chinese experiences.

II. Some Tactical Successes but a Strategic Failure
Machiavelli affirmed that “it is much safer to be feared than to be loved.” Yet, having
read Cicero,107 he immediately added that “a prince must nevertheless make himself feared
in such a way that he will avoid hatred, even if he does not acquire love; since one can very
easily be feared and yet not hated.”108 This is precisely what Beijing has failed to do.
Chinese influence operations have been met with tactical successes. China is able to
constrain private companies, such as airlines or hotel chains, to name their destinations differently (“Taipei, China”), or the NBA to apologize for the tweet of a club official. It also
demonstrated an ability to inflict high financial damages (when it blocked the website of
The New York Times in 2012, as a retaliation for an article Chinese authorities did not like,
the group’s stock market value fell by 20% in twenty-four hours). Additionally, from fear of
retributions, many companies refrain from publishing ads in media outlets critical of China,
which impoverishes these outlets. Yet, despite these little victories, the offensive has been a
strategic failure. China’s influence in the world has led to a backlash against it that is both
widespread and growing.
This is not a new trend: China remains its own best enemy in terms of influence. It
can be seen in Africa,109 where China’s image has changed: the honeymoon is over as the
country is increasingly criticized as predatory– its projects not benefiting local populations
– and for being as harmful as colonial powers were. In many places, as in Mali, the populations are exasperated, not only by the plundering of natural resources, particularly gold,
but also by the working conditions, the illegal entry of Chinese workers and the pollution
it generates. The fact that the leaders, benevolent towards the Chinese presence, generally
do not take into account the complaints of the population on this subject contributes to
the distrust of the elites and the polarization of societies. The BRI also faced numerous
setbacks in the past couple of years, with the same complaints (“Chinese try to take everything they can, without paying attention to the employees or the local companies. They act
as if we were a colony. But we won’t let it happen,” according to people working in the port
of Piraeus, which was bought by Cosco in 2016).110 The BRI is also “running out of steam”
for economic reasons, as Jean-Pierre Cabestan reminds us: “not only because the countries
of the South are finding it increasingly difficult to repay their debts to Chinese state banks,
but also because Beijing needs more financing to support domestic growth.”111 The reflux is
generalized and it had started before the more aggressive turn of the past couple of years.
Now, with its “wolf warrior” diplomacy, its information manipulations and brutal

asserted that only the second ensured durable power.

methods, Beijing has definitely altered its image. It was a done deal: the CCP could not
become as aggressive as Russia and, at the same time, maintain on the international stage
the ethos of a responsible actor peacefully rising.
This is precisely what some in China, more lucid than others, had feared, especially inside
the CICIR, the think tank of the MSS (the main civilian intelligence agency). In early April
2020, an internal report from the CICIR, presented to Xi Jinping, affirmed that the pandemic could provoke the strongest wave of anti-Chinese feelings in the world since
Tian’anmen in 1989, and that it could also feed into the resistance against BRI projects
and invite Washington to increase its financial and military support to Asian allies – increasing the risk of confrontation.112 Meanwhile, Shi Zhan (施展), director of the World Politics
Research Center at China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing warned that “this ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy is unsustainable and risks isolating us.”113
Again, this Chinese fall from grace on the international scene is the latest trend of a downward evolution that started before the pandemic. Several affairs, including the case of
espionage against the African Union headquarters, the “hostage diplomacy” used to coerce
Canada and a growing number of other countries, the revelations about the concentration
camps for Uyghurs (“China Cables”)114 and the management of the Hong Kong crisis have
all contributed to the deterioration of Beijing’s image after Xi Jinping came to power.
However, this evolution is relative: it is among the developed economies, especially
Western states (Europe and North America) and their allies (Japan, South Korea), that China’s
image has deteriorated significantly. It remains correct, and is even improving in developing
countries. This polarization reflects Beijing’s double discourse, which “plays on confrontation with the West and seduction of the South,”115 in Africa, Latin America and Asia.

This deterioration has been gradual, but it seems to have accelerated since 2017-2018,
especially in Australia (→ p. 544) and Sweden (→ p. 521) as noted previously, but also
in Canada (→ p. 539) and elsewhere in the world. In the United States, the election of
Donald Trump in 2017 catalyzed an ineluctable confrontation which the president dubbed
a new “cold war.” Americans now measure the extent of Chinese influence at home. In
July 2020, the director of the FBI explained that “the FBI is opening a new China-related
counterintelligence case about every 10 hours.”116 Several months later, Newsweek noted that
they had found “600 such groups in the U.S., all in regular touch with and guided by China’s
Communist Party – a larger-scale version of a pattern found in other countries around the
world.”117 In the United Kingdom, the deterioration of the relations – after the “golden
age” lauded by David Cameron during the 2015 visit of Xi Jinping in London118 – accelerated after 2019, first with the crisis in Hong Kong, which was particularly sensitive for the
British as they retroceded the former colony to China in 1997, and later with the sanitary
crisis (London criticized Beijing for its lack of transparency, the diffusion of fake news,
and for the cyberespionage that targeted British laboratories). Also notable was the British
change of mind that led to the exclusion of Huawei from British 5G networks, decided
in July 2020 (the Chinese embassy described it as an “error” for which the British would
“pay the consequences”) – a threat that apparently did not dissuade Germany and Romania
from also banning Huawei from their future 5G networks in April 2021. On February
4, 2021, OFCOM, the British media regulatory agency, cancelled CGTN’s broadcasting
license based on the assessment that CGTN wasn’t the one making the editorial choices for
the channel, but the CCP. This added to the deterioration of the bilateral relation.119 As in
the United States, this changing attitude toward China is a bipartisan issue widely endorsed
by a public opinion increasingly warry of Beijing.
In France as well, awareness, although more discrete, is nevertheless palpable, with a
clear acceleration in the first quarter of 2021 (see below).

The French Awakening
As elsewhere, the image of China has deteriorated in France for the last couple of
years, and especially after the appointment of Ambassador Lu Shaye in Paris (2019), a
“wolf-warrior diplomat” who contributed to making the embassy more aggressive, especially
on social networks, as we saw in this report (→ p. 234). The Covid-19 pandemic aggravated
this tendency because the embassy was on the defensive and multiplied its attacks – such as
an April 2020 article on the “EHPAD nursing staff ” (who had “abandoned,” “deserted” and
“left their pensioners to die from hunger and illnesses”), following which the ambassador was
summoned by the French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs (→ p. 238).
Other cases have contributed to mobilizing the French public opinion against Beijing, including the November 2019 revelation that Huawei was suing the researcher Valérie Niquet
for libel (→ p. 53); she instantly received many messages of support. The persecution of
Uyghurs, better and better documented, was a powerful accelerator to raise attention on the
topic – especially thanks to researchers who have been mobilizing for years (in a collective

op-ed in Le Monde in 2018 for instance120), as well as to the commitment of several politicians,
including the French MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, who has incidentally become a target of the
embassy.121 In September 2020, President Macron publicly denounced “unacceptable practices” in Xinjiang for the first time.122 Meanwhile, a growing number of investigative reports
have documented the Chinese power, influence, or espionage – including several issues
and special issues in several French magazines in 2020.123
The negative view of China in France can be measured: a poll conducted in October and
November 2020 showed that “62% of those polled have a negative or very negative view […]
regardless of political affiliation, suggesting that there is a high level of consensus,” which
puts China “the second most negatively-perceived country […] just after North Korea,
and followed by Russia.”124 And several stars have contributed to this awakening, such as the
football player Antoine Griezmann who, in December 2020, announced he had terminated his
contract with Huawei, “due to the strong suspicions that [the company] had contributed to the
development of a “Uyghur Alert” thanks to a facial recognition software.”125
In October 2020, an article by Laurence Defranoux in Libération noted a “change of tone”
in France vis-à-vis Beijing. While, “for a long time, in the face of Beijing’s propaganda and
attempts at censorship and intimidation, the response in France was muted, if not non-existent, as the fear of economic retaliation was great,” things were visibly beginning to change.126
During the first months of 2021, several elements testified to an acceleration of the French
awakening. On January 21, the Ministry of the Armed Forces published its 2021 Strategic
Update, updating the 2017 Strategic Review: the document mentioned China not only more
times than in 2017, but also more than Russia. It also presented the country first and foremost
as a “strategic rival.”127 Media have also increasingly reported on the growing aggressiveness of Beijing. And they have broadened their audience, for instance with the 70-minute
TV documentary “China, the great offensive” broadcast on France 2 on February 25. The
following day, a long investigation was printed in the weekly Le Point on “how China pushes
its pawns at the University,”128 which notably charged Christian Mestre, the former president
of the University of Strasbourg, who subsequently resigned his position as ethics officer of
the Strasbourg Eurometropolis (→ p. 409).129 On March 18, the same Le Point journalist,
Jérémy André, the weekly’s correspondent to Hong Kong, published another investigation on
“[how] Beijing takes advantage of our researchers.”130 These demonstrations had already been
common in Australia, in the United States, in Canada and even in the United Kingdom, as we
showed in this report, but they had never been done with such a level of details in France.
The persecution of Uyghurs is also more insistently denounced from the printed press –
which no longer hesitate to discuss “the hidden genocide” on its cover, such as L’Obs did in
early March131 – to the political class. The Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs, JeanYves Le Drian, denounced in several official speeches “the unjustifiable practices used

against Uyghurs, and [a] large-scale institutionalized surveillance and repression system”
(February 16); or “the forced sterilization, the sexual abuses in the camps, the disappearances,
massive detentions, the forced labor, the destruction of the cultural heritage, starting with the
places of worship, and the generalized surveillance aver the population” in Xinjiang. He renewed his “insistent call for an impartial, independent and transparent mission of international experts to be sent to Xinjiang, as soon as possible, supervised by the High Commissioner
for Human Rights” (March 10).132 He also stated that the term “genocide” “deserves to be
discussed and we are ready to consider it.”133
Finally, a new level was reached when, within a few days (March 15-22), it was revealed
that the Embassy of China had pressured senators to cancel a planned visit to Taiwan
and insulted the researcher Antoine Bondaz, who had defended them. The Twitter account of the embassy called him a “small strike,” a “mad hyena”, and an “ideological troll,”
leading to a unanimous condemnation and a high diplomatic coverage – a symptomatic episode of the perverse effect (which we labelled the “Bondaz Effect”) of the “wolf-warrior”
diplomacy (→ p. 237). And it did not stop there: at approximately the same moment, Beijing
announced sanctions against 10 Europeans, including the French MEP Raphaël Glucksmann,
in retaliation for sanctions adopted by the EU due to the repression of Uyghurs. For all these
reasons (insults and sanctions), the Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs summoned the
Chinese ambassador on March 22 but the latter did not come to the meeting, which provoked the anger of Clément Beaune, the secretary of state for European Affairs: “France and
Europe are no doormats. Someone summoned ought to oblige.”134 When the ambassador
finally came to the Quai d’Orsay, the following day, he was received by the director of the
Directorate for Asia and Oceania, Bertrand Lortholary, who told him that “the methods of the
embassy, and the tone of its public communication, are totally unacceptable and cross the line
of what is commonly deemed acceptable for any diplomatic representation, wherever it may
be.”135 This sequence in March 2021 was disastrous for the image of China in France
and contributed to a heightened awareness among politicians and the general public
of the unacceptable practices of Chinese authorities.
A few months later, another sequence drew attention to “Beijing’s offensive against academic freedom [which] calls for defensive measures,” as diplomat Pierre Buhler explained on
June 10 in an article denouncing “a disturbing policy of Beijing, which constitutes a threat to
higher education and research in democratic countries.”136 Early July, the Senate launched
an information mission on “extra-European state influences on French universities,
the academic world and on their impact,”137 which quickly heard Pierre Buhler and has
since questioned a large number of French and foreign experts, including the authors of this
report.138 The rapporteur is Senator André Gattolin, who is highly invested in the defense
of human rights (having, for example, publicly displayed his support for the demonstrations
in Hong Kong in 2019139), co-chair for France of the Inter-parliamentary alliance on China
(IPAC → p. 252) and an excellent authority on China’s influence strategy in France.140 If the
information mission is interested in several countries, the rapporteur believes that China represents “80% of the problem.”141 A few weeks later, several articles on “Chinese entryism in
French universities” published in Libération (July 27, 2021) caused the embassy to react in a

press release accusing, as usual, all critical voices of racism and confirming Godwin’s law (it
said it was “revolted” by these articles “which, in a racist tone, publicly incite anti-Chinese and
Sinophobic sentiment […]. It is astonishing to discover that in the 21st century, some people
still use “Nazi-like” propaganda to advocate this kind of extreme racism in the media”).142
Published on October 5, 2021, the Senate report considers that France is “an important target of
these operations” and “would benefit from being inspired by foreign examples in raising awareness, or even collaborating with certain states to develop appropriate responses”. This report,
which was branded as “a first alert to the whole scientific community,” formulates several
proposals.143
Finally, still in the Senate, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense adopted on September
23, 2021, another information report which bore the question: “Can France contribute to the
European awakening in a Chinese 21st century?”144 The two vice-presidents of the commission
and rapporteurs, Sens. Pascal Allizard and Gisèle Jourda, respectively declared on this occasion
that they “were very struck, four years ago, by the absence of Europe in the face of China’s
global deployment. We must react and give ourselves the diplomatic, legislative and monetary
means to face this power strategy”; “We must be aware of the weight of the Chinese United
Front, which is not a form of influence, but of interference!”145 The French awakening is in fact
part of a European awakening, that the MEP Nathalie Loiseau embodied when she declared
in January 2021 that “the time to be naive is behind us.”146
In concrete terms, this means that, thanks to the vigilance of researchers, journalists, politicians,
diplomats and the general public, France is now a less soft, less easy target for Chinese influence. Tongues are loosening, self-censorship is becoming less acceptable, pressure is being
denounced, as is complacency. When Livres Hebdo published an article announcing that “The
Frenchman Maxime Vivas receives a prize at the Beijing Book Fair,”147 as if it were neutral
news, a few days later a score of researchers, sinologists, tibetologists, specialists of Uyghurs,
including the president of INALCO Jean-François Huchet, published a tribune in which they
condemned what “seems to be a copy-paste of what can be read in the official organs of the
Chinese Communist Party […]. That Livres Hebdo highlights the prizes awarded by the Chinese
Communist Party is fine, but one would expect from a magazine intended for book professionals
that the reviews bring a critical, detailed and well-argued perspective and are not simple relays of
Chinese propaganda.”148 This example, taken among others, illustrates the fact that the French, or
at least a growing number of them, have finally “woken up” and are making the environment less
permissive to the ambitions of the Party-State. In summary, awareness in France of the risks
posed by Chinese influence has been strong and growing since 2019, with a clear acceleration in 2020-2021. It is in this context of a “French awakening,” which now seems
irreversible, that the publication of this present report in September 2021 takes place.

Even Central and Eastern European countries, the traditional spearheads of Beijing
in Europe (→ p. 310), are becoming more reticent: the “17+1” Summit, on February 9,
2021, was actually a “17-6” meeting because, in front of Xi Jinping, six European states limited their participation to a mere ministerial delegation. The reasons for this loss of appetite
are known: “the Chinese infrastructural promises have disappointed, trade exchanges have

been tremendously advantageous to Beijing, and Chinese propaganda, in the early stages
of the Covid-19 pandemic, has seriously tarnished the image of the Middle Kingdom.”149
Some now believe that the ‘”17+1” format – which was meant to be a European door for
Beijing – is becoming a “zombie mechanism” which could progressively unravel. Lithuania
has led the way by withdrawing in March 2021 and calling on the other eleven European
members to do the same.150 In September, the Lithuanian foreign minister explained that
the only format in which the balance of power would be balanced would be a 27+1, which
would require unity among European countries when facing China.151 The bilateral relationship had deteriorated sharply in July 2021 when Lithuania announced the opening of
a representative office of “Taiwan” (not “Taipei”) in the country. The following month,
Beijing and Vilnius recalled their ambassadors. In September, the Lithuanian National
Cybersecurity Center issued a report concluding that the phones of three Chinese brands
(Xiaomi, Huawei and OnePlus) posed risks, including remote censorship, and the deputy
defense minister declared: “Our recommendation is not to buy new Chinese smartphones
and to get rid of those already acquired as quickly as possible.”152 And the press emphasized
how “small” Lithuania has become a symbol of resistance to the Chinese superpower.153
The Czech Republic is another example: despite Beijing’s strong proxies in that country, particularly in the political (starting with President Miloš Zeman and several members of the government) and economic spheres (PPF → p. 272), the Chinese influence is
increasingly being challenged and denounced, from the resistance of the mayor of Prague
(→ p. 266) to the Senate president’s visit to Taiwan (→ p. 267), to the exclusion of Huawei
and ZTE from 5G-related tenders, and to the publication of reports by the cybersecurity
agency (NUKIB) and the Security and Internal Intelligence Service (BIS), whose regular
alerts contribute to the debate.
One after the other, states reevaluate their relations to China, taking legislative,
economic and political actions to protect themselves from it. Increasingly, states also coordinate their actions to “stand together” against China. Here, March 26, 2021 was rather
exceptional: the diplomats of 26 countries – Canada, but also the United States, France,
Germany, the United Kingdom and others – met in front of the Chinese tribunal where
Michael Kovrig was tried154 – one of the two Canadians victim of the “hostage diplomacy”
(→ p. 411). Meanwhile, the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and
Canada sanctioned several Chinese officials involved in the repression against Uyghurs,
in a coordinated effort that sent “the clearest message […] that the international community will not turn a blind eye to such serious and systematic violations of basic human
rights,” according to the UK Foreign Secretary.155 These were actually the first European

sanctions in more than thirty years, the last (an embargo on weapons) dating back to
1989 – an additional sign of the degradation of the relations. Furthermore, and again,
on that very day, the Chinese sanctions against four entities and ten European officials
only reinforced the European solidarity against Beijing, at all levels, even among the
civil society. Three days later, the directors of 32 European think tanks and research institutes, from more than twenty countries, signed a declaration denouncing Chinese sanctions
against European researchers and the most important European research center on China,
MERICS (→ p. 285).156
The result is paradoxical: while one of the Party-State’s strategies is to divide Europe,
its behavior unites Europe against itself, losing the levers (such as the 17+1) it had
hoped to enjoy. In the same way, while one of the strategies of the Party-State is to weaken
the transatlantic relationship, by making European countries keep their distance from the
logic of the Sino-American “cold war” and adopt a third way instead, by its behavior it is
bringing them closer to Washington – all the more so since, with the change of administration, the U.S. discourse on China is less caricatural, and therefore more acceptable. As Sylvie
Kauffmann summarizes it well, “through clumsiness or hubris, China is pushing the
Europeans into the arms of the Americans.157 It is, in short, self-sabotage.
This movement is not limited to state officials: populations are awakening to the problem
and, in almost all countries, China’s image has never been as bad as it is today.158 China is
facing an “unpopularity problem.”159 A European study, conducted in September and
October 2020, confirmed the largely negative opinions of China, except in Serbia and in
Russia.160 In Australia, “trust in China is at the lowest level ever recorded in the Lowy Institute
Poll, with only 23% of Australians saying they trust China somewhat or a lot ‘to act responsibly in the world’, a 29-point fall since 2018.”161 Even in South Korea, a country that has
maintained close ties to China, the discontents toward China have reached 75%.162
Since 2020 approximately, and particularly after the start of the pandemic during which
China became more aggressive, analysts have tried to explain the “counter-productive
behavior”163 adopted by Beijing. Even if the explanation is known – for the Party-State,
the priority is not to seduce local populations but to ensure its survival and to strengthen
its power in China – the Party-State was probably not prepared for the fallout of such a
behavior. Indeed, its unpopularity has become a problem so pregnant that it could
indirectly weaken the Party, including vis-à-vis the Chinese population. Anyhow, this
is certainly the message that needs to be carried to make Chinese officials more cognizant
to the consequences of their actions.

ABSTRACT
For several years, and especially since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, some Chinese diplomats, commonly called “wolf warriors” by Western media, have adopted
a warlike tone in the media and on social networks. While this new practice, heavily
criticized by Western and Asian public opinion, reinforces the perception of China
as a threat, this paper questions the motives of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
in perpetuating such a policy. The paradox is that the real target of China’s foreign
policy are the Chinese themselves, at home or abroad. In line with previous Chinese
leaders, the main purpose of this domestically oriented foreign policy is to legitimize
the CCP in the eyes of its own citizens. Thus, “wolf warrior” diplomacy does not affect
the objectives of Chinese foreign policy. Three elements support this hypothesis: the
visibility of the “wolf warriors” in China, the subtle references to the “century of humiliation” and finally the instrumentalization of the cultural divide to alienate democratic
regimes.

RUSSIAN STRATEGIES OF INFLUENCE
IN THE SOUTH CAUCASUS REGION
Régis GENTÉ
Journalist and former-Soviet Republics Expert

ABSTRACT
Russia uses a variety of methods to influence its former Soviet republics of Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Since its conquest of the region in the 19th Century, Russia
considers Transcaucasia particularly important for its geopolitical standing. No longer
able to persuade or attract South Caucasus populations, Russia’s strategy of influence is largely based on military power (hard power). It struggles to develop its soft
power in this region, resorting finally to more coercive methods like exploiting: conflicts in the secessionist regions of Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia;
Kremlin-affiliated oligarchs; and energy prices. This traps Russia in a vicious cycle: to
retain its influence in the South Caucasus, it becomes increasingly coercive and aggressive, appearing malevolent to local populations. The Kremlin relies on well-known
and established strategies in the South Caucasus, making it an important case study
in the analysis of Russian foreign policy in general.

ABSTRACT
Although the Russian media apparatus is subject to considerable scrutiny in the West, it is much less so in
other regions of the world, in particular in Africa. Consequently, at a time when Russia appears to be attempting to regain footing on the continent, it seemed necessary to undertake a preliminary exploration of the
role that this country can play in the African information space, with particular focus on the French-speaking
countries of Africa. This paper presents the results of a quantitative study of the distribution and propagation
of information content produced by the Russian news agencies RT (Russia Today) and Sputnik News. On the
basis of the data collected, it has been possible to establish an initial general map of the circulation paths of
this content, its relays and the discursive strategies used by the various players involved. In addition to its
empirical value as an aid to understanding the real state of Russian implantation in the information space of
the French-speaking African world, this paper also aims to highlight the methodological possibilities available,
by explaining the methods used here, at the intersection of geopolitics and big data.

For a long time, it could be said that China, unlike Russia, sought to be loved
rather than feared; that it wanted to seduce and project a positive image of
itself in the world, or to inspire admiration. Today, Beijing has not renounced
to seduce, nor its overall attractiveness and its ambition to shape international
standards, and it is essential for the Chinese Communist Party not to lose face.
And yet, Beijing is also increasingly comfortable with infiltration and coercion: its
influence operations have become considerably tougher in recent years and its
methods are resembling more closely the ones employed by Moscow. This is a
“Machiavellian turn” inasmuch as the Party-State now seems to believe that “it
is much safer to be feared than to be loved,” in the words of Machiavelli in The
Prince. This is a clear Russification of Chinese influence operations.
This report delves into this evolution, with the ambition to cover the whole specter
of influence, from the most benign (public diplomacy) to the most malign methods,
that is, interference (clandestine activities). To do that, the report is divided into four
parts: successively laying out the main concepts; the actors implementing these
operations, including the Base 311 of the People’s Liberation Army; the actions
conducted by Beijing toward the diasporas, the media, diplomacy, economy,
politics, education, think tanks, and in terms of information manipulations –
some levers among others; then, several cases are studied (Taiwan, Singapore,
Sweden, Canada, the operations that targeted Hong Kong protestors in 2019,
and the one that branded the Covid-19 as an American fabrication in 2020). The
conclusion returns to this “Russification”, which has three components: Beijing
is inspired by Moscow in several ways, there are obviously differences between
the two, and there is also a certain degree of cooperation. Finally, the report
assesses the effectiveness of this new Chinese posture, which can boast some
tactical successes, but constitutes a strategic failure.
