If there’s one thing that businesses, boards of directors and C-level execs can take from CrowdStrike’s 2015 Threat
Report, it is that the paradigm has broadened beyond people, processes, and technology to now include integrated,
crowdsourced, and enriched threat intelligence.
Our Global Threat Report highlights that today’s threats, more than ever before, are driven by geopolitical and economic events around the world. The primary motivation behind global cyber activity has now shifted from disparate
activities carried out by individuals, groups and criminal gangs pursuing short-term financial gain, to skilled adversaries
driven by strategic global conflicts. The economic downturn and new Five Year Plan in China will continue to drive
their state-sponsored cyber espionage activities. The situation in the Ukraine and falling oil prices will continue to fuel
targeted intrusions from Russia. The conflict in the Middle East between Saudi Arabia and Iran over Yemen will continue
to generate hacktivism from that region. CEOs and boards of directors who ignore or disregard the ramifications of
global events such as these will pay for it in the loss of revenue, jobs, intellectual property, and shareholder value.
This shift underscores the importance for an effective intelligence program about the motivations of
your adversary. The mantra “people, processes and technology” is no longer enough for cyber security. In today’s threat environment, it takes people, processes, technology AND intelligence.
Intelligence is no longer a “nice-to-have.” It is a mandatory element of stopping breaches.
How can you expect to win if you do not have a solid understanding of how your adversary
operates, what their tendencies are, what their goals are, and what motivates them? Recognize
why they would want to come after you and your company. If you don’t know the game plan
of your adversary, you will fail to defend your corporation. It sounds like common sense, but
it is something that is lost in the outdated discussion of people, processes and technology.
Companies must have intelligence, either home-grown or provided by third-party sources who
have the trained personnel to monitor, capture and analyze threat data effectively.
Emphasizing intelligence has been a cornerstone for CrowdStrike’s approach to security since the foundation of the company five years ago: Providing cloud-based security powered by comprehensive, in-house
threat intelligence. With our Falcon Platform and Threat Intelligence team, we have a unique bird’s-eye view by having
our endpoint sensors deployed in more than 170 different countries, handling more than ten billion events per day,
as well as providing incident response services in response to some of the largest breaches. The “brains” behind our
Falcon Platform is our Threat Graph engine, which constantly collects and analyzes billions of events, both in real time
and retrospectively. As a result, on a weekly basis, we are identifying and mitigating hundreds of breaches for which
traditional defenses silently fail.
The CrowdStrike team has put tremendous effort into capturing this real attack telemetry, analyzing it, distilling how
adversaries operate, and more importantly, what motivates them. We hope our experiences and the lessons learned that
are manifested in the 2015 Threat Report will provide companies a sampling of the intelligence they need to protect
themselves in 2016 and beyond.

INTRODUCTION
At CrowdStrike, a fundamental belief is that intelligence powers everything we do.
It drives our next-generation endpoint protection, it fuels our incident response
teams so they can resolve incidents faster, and it is consumed by our customers
and their enterprise tools, allowing them to detect and stop attacks.

Throughout the year, the
CrowdStrike Intelligence team
provides numerous intelligence
summaries to customers with
varying periodicity. These
intelligence summaries are meant
to memorialize what occurred in
a specified period of time. It is our
hope that by reviewing previous
activity, we can begin to peer
around the corner to predict what
may occur in the future.
Adversaries are human; they have
patterns, preferences, and shortand long-term plans. If we pay
close attention, these patterns can
lead to a better understanding
of the mindset of the adversary,
and ultimately allow us to know
their next move. The Looking
