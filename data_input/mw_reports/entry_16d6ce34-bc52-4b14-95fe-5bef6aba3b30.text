The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team and McAfee Labs Malware Operations Group
have discovered a new global campaign targeting nuclear, defense, energy, and financial
companies, based on McAfee® Global Threat Intelligence. This campaign, Operation
Sharpshooter, leverages an in-memory implant to download and retrieve a second-stage
implant—which we call Rising Sun—for further exploitation. According to our analysis, the
Rising Sun implant uses source code from the Lazarus Group’s 2015 backdoor Trojan
Duuzer in a new framework to infiltrate these key industries.
Operation Sharpshooter’s numerous technical links to the Lazarus Group seem too obvious
to immediately draw the conclusion that they are responsible for the attacks, and instead
indicate a potential for false flags. Our research focuses on how this actor operates, the
global impact, and how to detect the attack. We shall leave attribution to the broader
security community.
Read our full analysis of Operation Sharpshooter.
Have we seen this before?
This campaign, while masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity, gathers
information to monitor for potential exploitation. Our analysis also indicates similar
techniques associated with other job recruitment campaigns.
Global impact
In October and November 2018, the Rising Sun implant has appeared in 87 organizations
across the globe, predominantly in the United States, based on McAfee telemetry and our
analysis. Based on other campaigns with similar behavior, most of the targeted
organizations are English speaking or have an English-speaking regional office. This actor
has used recruiting as a lure to collect information about targeted individuals of interest or
organizations that manage data related to the industries of interest. The McAfee Advanced
Threat Research team has observed that the majority of targets were defense and
government-related organizations.

Conclusion
Our discovery of this new, high-function implant is another example of how targeted attacks
attempt to gain intelligence. The malware moves in several steps. The initial attack vector is
a document that contains a weaponized macro to download the next stage, which runs in
3/5

memory and gathers intelligence. The victim’s data is sent to a control server for monitoring
by the actors, who then determine the next steps.
We have not previously observed this implant. Based on our telemetry, we discovered that
multiple victims from different industry sectors around the world have reported these
indicators.
Was this attack just a first-stage reconnaissance operation, or will there be more? We will
continue to monitor this campaign and will report further when we or others in the security
industry receive more information. The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team encourages
our peers to share their insights and attribution of who is responsible for Operation
Sharpshooter.
