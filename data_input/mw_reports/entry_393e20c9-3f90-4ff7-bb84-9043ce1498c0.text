Morphisec, through its breach prevention with Moving Target Defense technology, has identified a
new, sophisticated campaign delivery which has been successfully evading the radar of many security
vendors. Through a simple email phishing tactic with an html attachment, threat attackers are

delivering AsyncRAT (a remote access trojan) designed to remotely monitor and control its infected
computers through a secure, encrypted connection. This campaign has been in effect for a period of 4
to 5 months, with the lowest detection rates as presented through VirusTotal.
Morphisec backtraced the campaign to September 12, 2021. This campaign continued its evolution
while delivering formally known crypter as a service, such as HCrypt and Alosh. This blog post
explains the campaign delivery vector in detail.

Technical Introduction
In many cases, victims received an email message with an html attachment in the form of a receipt:
Receipt-<digits>.html.
Below is an example of such an email message:

Figure 1: Fake receipt
When the victim decides to open the receipt, they see the following webpage that requests them to
save a downloaded ISO file. They believe it's a regular file download that will go through all the
channels of gateway and network security scanners. Surprisingly, that's not the case.
In fact, the ISO download is generated within the victim’s browser by the JavaScript code that is
embedded inside the HTML receipt file, and it is not downloaded from a remote server. In the next
section, we will describe how this code successfully generates the file.

Figure 3: Low detection rate by AV solutions

Stage 1: HTML and Javascript Loader
As mentioned earlier, the ISO file is not being delivered as a file blob object over the network, but
instead it is being delivered as a base64 string. This base64toblob function gets a Base64 encoded
string as an input and is responsible for the decoding to ASCII by a window.atob. Next, the result is
converted to a byte array from which a new blob is created. The blob type is set according to a given
mime type (in this case, application/octet-stream).
We found that the earlier variants weren't obfuscated:

Figure 4: Generation of the iso file
In the below snapshot, it's clearly demonstrated how the blob is injected as part of the URL object
while mimicking the download of the ISO file as if it had been delivered remotely.

Once the user opens the generated ISO, it is automatically mounted as a DVD Drive (under windows
10). The mount contains either a .bat or a .vbs file inside.

Figure 6: Auto-Mount for ISO files
The .bat/.vbs file that is included in the auto-mounted drive is responsible for downloading and
executing the next stage as part of a powershell process execution:

Deobfuscated:

Stage 2: Reflective .NET Injection
The PowerShell file code that's executed is responsible for:

Creating persistancy through Schedule Task
Executing a dropped .vbs file, usually at %ProgramData%
Unpacking an Base64 encoded and deflate compressed .NET module
Injecting the .NET module payload in-memory(dropper)

Figure 7: Persistency

Stage 3: The dropper

The injected .NET module's main purpose is to fill the role of a dropper while its working path is
primarily at %ProgramData%.

Figure 8: .NET Module Dropper
Above, we can see that the Visual Basic file is written to the ProgramData\internet folder. Immediately
after the execution, there is an attempt to delete traces.
The dropper creates three files:
Net.vbs - obfuscated invocation of Net.bat
Net.bat - invocation of Net.ps1
Net.ps1 - next stage injection
Deobfuscated Net.vbs content:

Figure 9: Antivirus Check
The check for AV solutions present on the machine is designed to skip features such as:
**If user is in the built-in administrator group then perform:
UAC bypass using Disk Cleanup
Disable of action center notifications
Set of windows defender exclusion

In most cases, attackers have delivered AsyncRAT as the final payload that was hiding within the
legitimate .NET aspnet_compiler.exe process.

This new attack campaign is bad news, especially since most NGAV and EDR vendors’ solutions are
failing to detect and stop this threat; however, the good news for Morphisec customers is that our
Moving Target Defense technology is stopping these attacks. Leading analysts are calling Moving

Target Defense a “game changer” as it can uniquely detect and stop ransomware, zero-day and other
advanced attacks that often bypass NGAV, EDR, and other defenses. Learn more about Moving
Target Defense and why Gartner cited this technology in its Emerging Trends and Technologies
