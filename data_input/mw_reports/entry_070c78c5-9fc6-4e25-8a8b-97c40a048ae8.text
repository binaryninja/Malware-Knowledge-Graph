Alert

On 14/05/21 the Health Service Executive (HSE) was impacted by a Ransomware
attack which has affected multiple services on their network. The NCSC along with the
HSE and partners are currently investigating this incident and an Incident Response
process is ongoing.
Threat
Type

Malicious cyber activity was also detected on the Department of Health (DoH) network
early on Friday morning (14th May 2021), however due to the deployment of tools during
the investigation process an attempt to execute ransomware was detected and stopped.
These attacks are believed to be part of the same campaign targeting the Irish health
sector
Background

• On Thursday afternoon (13/05/21), the NCSC was made aware of potential suspicious activity on the Department of Health (DoH) network and immediately
launched an investigation in conjunction with the DoH and a 3rd-party security
provider to determine the nature and extent of any possible threat.

• Preliminary investigations indicated suspected presence of cobalt strike Beacon,
which is a remote access tool. Cobalt strike is often used by malicious actors in
order to move laterally within an environment prior to execution of a ransomware
payload.

• At approx 07:00 hrs on 14th May the NCSC was made aware of a significant in-

cident affecting HSE systems. Initial reports indicated a human-operated ‘Conti’
ransomware attack that had severely disabled a number of systems and necessitated the shutdown of the majority of other HSE systems.

• Early Friday morning (14th May 2021) malicious cyber activity was also detected
on the DoH network , however due to a combination of anti-virus software and
the deployment of tools during the investigation process an attempt to execute
ransomware was detected and stopped.

• The HSE took the decision to shut down all of its IT systems as a precaution in
order to assess and limit the impact.
Response

• The NCSC has activated its crisis response procedures and is providing support
and assistance to the HSE and Dept of Health in responding to and recovering
from the incident.

• The NCSC is also continuing to monitor other networks to address the risk of
further attacks.

• The NCSC have circulated appropriate advice to constituent organisations following further analysis of this cyber attack.

Impact
• There are serious impacts to health operations and some non-emergency procedures are being postponed as hospitals implement their business continuity
plans.

• The national vaccination programme is not affected.

6. Harden endpoints
Eradicate
1. Wipe, rebuild and update all infected devices.
2. Ensure antivirus is up to date on all systems.
3. Make sure all hardware devices are patched and up to date.

ensure your backups have not be exposed to malware.
Recover (The 5 R’s to Recovery)
1. Restore endpoints
2. Re-image devices if required
3. Re-set credentials
4. Re-Integrate Quarantined systems

Establish monitoring of the network for further suspicious activity, particular attention
should be placed on activity related to pre-cursor malware that may have pre-empted
ransomware attack (IcedID/BazarLoader/Trickbot etc.).

The NCSC have observed a variant of Conti Ransomware and inital analysis has revealed the following:
• Cobalt Strike beacons discovered on systems suggest that it was used to move
laterally within the environment prior to executing the Conti ransomware payload.
• Use of WMIC.exe to delete shadow copies:

cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WMIC.exe shadowcopy
where "ID=’{REDACTED}’" delete
• Internal network subnets are enumerated and results are saved to files
• Multiple batch files (.bat) used to copy malware to endpoints
• psexec.exe then used to execute malicious payload on endpoints using

Analysis

compromised user credentials
• Conti Ransomware v3 - 32 bit executable discovered
• Creates mutex:
YUIOGHJKCVVBNMFGHJKTYQUWIETASKDHGZBDGSKL237782321344
• The malware will attempt to encrypt all files with the exception of the following
file names:
– CONTI_LOG.txt
– readme.txt
– *.FEEDC
– *.msi
– *.sys
– *.lnk
– *.dll
– *.exe
• The malware begins by calling many bogus WinAPIs with invalid arguments to
intentionally throw exceptions. These are handled by the malware and act as an
anti-emulation/sandbox evasion technique
• Encrypted files are renamed with a .FEEDC extension
