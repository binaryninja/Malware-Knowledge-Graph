Malvertising Campaign Uses RIG EK to Drop Quant
Loader which Downloads FormBook.

October 10, 2017

A couple days ago I came across an unusual looking request for a RIG EK landing page.
The log showed the referer to be coming from a site called pay-scale[.]us:

Looking through the logs surrounding the event I could see that the user visited a shady site
using the .ac ccTLD. Traffic estimates showed that this site received 500K visitors over the
last 30 days. When I was researching the site, I was redirected via malicious ad traffic to tech
support scams. This leads me to believe the initial referer was from malvertising. The malvert
likely redirected the host to pay-scale[.]us via a 3XX status code.
Examining the page source for pay-scale[.]us shows the website was mirrored
from usmotors[.]com using HTTrack Website Copier:

1/12

Looking a little farther down the page we can see how the user got redirected to RIG EK
from pay-scale[.]us:

The domain in the hidden iframe, medical-help[.]top, resolves to 91.92.136.170.
Looking at the Whois information shows these domains were registered using the name
“Terry Kornfeld” and email address morganaanna7@gmail.com. Searching for all domains
registered using that name and/or email address returned the following:

These sites should be considered malicious. Additionally, some of them are being used for
C2 activities. More on that later.
Below is the GET request that was generated due to the hidden iframe on pay-scale[.]us:

The server returns a 302 Found with a location containing the RIG EK landing page URL.
2/12

Further examination of the infrastructure being used in this campaign show that the threat
actor(s) are utilizing Keitaro TDS:

Below is an image of the HTTP traffic captured during this infection chain:

RIG EK dropped two identical Quant Loader payloads in %TEMP%:
3/12

When Quant Loader was executed it copied itself to %APPDATA%[uid]svchost.exe:

[uid] is the eight-digit unique ID generated for the infected host. Forcepoint shows how the
unique ID is generated:
1. Obtain the Windows GUID value
from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCryptography
2. Extract only the number values, no letters or dashes
3. Copy 8 of the numbers, beginning with the 5th number
The malware then re-launches itself under “svchost.exe” and creates file
“C:Users[Username]AppDataLocalTempper”. The following processes and actions were
recorded:
1. svchost.exe creates process regini.exe
2. regini.exe reads data from file %TEMP%per
3. svchost.exe deletes file %TEMP%per
4. svchost.exe sets AutoStart registry key
“HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRunQt”

4/12

Quant Loader also modifies Windows Firewall to allow outbound communications using the
command:
netsh.exe advfirewall firewall add rule "name=Quant"
"program=c:usersappdata[uid]svchost.exe" dir=Out action=allow

I found post-infection traffic to the C2 at filmsdays[.]top/q/, which was registered by “Terry
Kornfeld” using the email address morganaanna7@gmail.com:

id = the unique ID of the infected host
c = the current index of the server being used
mk = string likely used as an affiliate of campaign ID
il = Haven’t confirmed
vr = Haven’t confirmed but could be version number
5/12

bt = Haven’t confirmed but could be x86 or x64
Below is an example of the Quant Loader C2 TCP connections captured during my infection:
Remote Address: 85.217.170.186
Remote Host Name: t.co
Remote Port: 80
Process Name: svchost.exe
Process Path: C:UsersWin7 32bitappdataroaming[uid]svchost.exe
Remote IP Country: Bulgaria
Remote Address: 212.73.150.215
Remote Host Name: v22597.vps.ag
Remote Port: 80
Process Name: svchost.exe
Process Path: C:UsersWin7 32bitappdataroaming[uid]svchost.exe
Remote IP Country: Bulgaria
In my infection the first server (c=1) responded with the location of follow-up malware located
at motorsus[.]us/fb.exe.
Motorsus[.]us appears to be under control of the same threat actor(s). The name and email
used to register this domain is “Lee M Clark” and john.benjack@mailfence.com. Below is a
list of current domains using that registrant information.

This payload is dropped in %TEMP% and executed.

The malware being downloaded by Quant Loader was identified as FormBook by my
friend @Antelox.

6/12

FormBook, once executed, copied itself (it was hidden) to %USERPROFILE%:

The malware was renamed to mfcgn2pl.exe.
According to FireEye, it can also use the following prefixes for its name:
ms
mfc
win
gdi
vga
igfx
user
help
config
update
regsvc
chkdsk
systray

audiodg
certmgr
autochk
taskhost
colorcpl
services
IconCache
ThumbCache
Cookies
It can also use the following file extensions:
.exe
.com
.scr
.pif
.cmd
.bat
If it is running with normal privileges it is copied to one the following directories:
%USERPROFILE%
%APPDATA%
%TEMP%
Here is another image showing another copy called Cookiescz7x.cmd being created in
%APPDATA%:

If it is running with elevated privileges it copies itself to one of the following directories:
8/12

%ProgramFiles%
%CommonProgramFiles%
In my infection I found it configuring persistence to
HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun:

However, depending on its privileges, it can also use the following locations for persistence:
HKCUSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesExplorerRun
HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesExplorerRun
HKCUSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun
FormBook was beaconing to basefilm[.]top/tesla/shell123/config.php.
Basefilm[.]top is registered to “Shirhall Shirhall” and is using the registrant email
address annacrown44@gmail.com.
I captured the following GET requests:

The parameter “id” shown in the URL contains encoded information about the system.
The malware also uses HTTP POST requests to send data back to
basefilm[.]top/tesla/shell123/config.php:

According to FireEye, these messages to the C2 are RC4 encrypted and Base64 encoded.
9/12

FireEye also mentions that FormBook will use “function hooks to log keystrokes, steal
clipboard data, and extract authentication information from browser HTTP sessions.”
For keystrokes captured during a browsing session with Internet Explorer it created the
following file:
%APPDATA%JQ18T541JQ1log.ini

You can see my HTTP sessions and keystrokes being captured in the .ini file:

Quick note. My friend @Antelox examined the FormBook sample and discovered that it
downloaded ZeuS Panda with web injects for PayPal, eBay, Amazon, and BoQ (Bank of
Queensland). The ZeuS sample can be viewed below:
