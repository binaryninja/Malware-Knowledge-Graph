Raccoon Stealer was one of the most prolific information stealers in 2021, being used by multiple
cybercriminal actors. Due to its wide stealing capabilities, the customizability of the malware and its
ease of use, Raccoon Stealer was highly popular among threat actors. The malware was mainly
distributed using fake installers, or as cracked versions of popular software.
Previously sold as a malware-as-a-service on underground forums since early 2019, its
operations suddenly stopped on March 25, 2022. This abrupt shutdown was purportedly due to the
loss of a developer of the project Raccoon Stealer during the “special operation”, likely in reference
1/15

to the Russian conflict in Ukraine. At the time, the raccoonstealer profile stated on several forums
they “don’t say goodbye forever”, and that they were already working on a second version.

Figure 1. Raccoonstealer’s statement on the shutdown of the Raccoon Stealer project on the XSS
forum
SEKOIA.IO kept a close eye on activities related to Raccoon Stealer as it is assessed to make a
strong comeback in the information stealer market.
We have reverse-engineered the new version of Raccoon Stealer and our in-depth analysis is
available in part 2 at: https://blog.sekoia.io/raccoon-stealer-v2-part-2-in-depth-analysis/.

First signs of life
On June 10, 2022, while searching for stealers’ administration panels on the Shodan search
engine, SEKOIA.IO analysts stumbled upon active servers hosting a web page named “Raccoon
Stealer 2.0”.

After analysis of the files on the server, we could assert with high confidence that these servers
belong to the Raccoon Stealer infrastructure. Indeed several technical artefacts suggest that this
panel is linked to the malware:
the HTTP title: Raccoon Stealer 2.0 ;
the issued domain in the SSL certificates: raccoonstealer[.]app ;
several references to the raccoonstealer profile in the Javascript code: contacts:
[{title:"Jabber",content:"raccoonstealer[@]exploit[.]im"},
{title:"Telegram",content:"[@]raccoonstealer"}]

Based on this information, we came across raccoonstealer‘s publications on the underground
forum Exploit and their Telegram channel confirming that a first release of Raccoon Stealer v2 is
sold on Telegram since May 17.

Samples in the wild
On June 16, 2022, S2W published a comprehensive analysis1 of the new version of Raccoon
Stealer. Based on a file created by the malware (System Info.txt), they attributed payloads
distributed in the wild to the Raccoon Stealer V2. This file contains information about the victim’s
system.
The sample analysed by S2W matches a newly discovered malware family discussed on Twitter by
cybersecurity researchers, which was later named RecordBreaker by @James_inthe_box (related
tweet). Raccoon Stealer v2 and RecordBreaker could be two different names for the same
malware family.
Samples of Raccoon Stealer v2 were therefore observed in the wild since May 16, 2022. As for the
previous version, threat actors mainly distribute the information stealer using fake installers, or
cracked versions of popular software. Here are a few samples faking legitimate software installers:
F‑Secure FREEDOME VPN installer (F-Secure Freedome VPN
2.50.23.0.licensesrv.exe_KaHCr.exe);
R-Studio Network installer (R-Studio.v9.0.190312.licencekey.exe_v3G9m.exe);
Proton VPN installer (ProtonVPN.exe).

Malware sample attribution
In order to confirm that the sample analysed by S2W corresponds to a Raccoon Stealer v2 sample,
we compared the content of raccoonstealer‘s publications on their Telegram channel with our
technical analysis of the stealer.
4/15

The publications advertising Raccoon Stealer v2 are promoted by its developers to the user
community. The authors are therefore focused on the user experience of attackers (performances,
log processing, integrity, etc.) which can be embellished. However, raccoonstealer shared technical
features of their malware. In the following table, we have listed these descriptions to compare with
our observations during analysis.
Descriptions from the
raccoonstealer‘s Telegram

SEKOIA.IO‘s commentary

“the styler is written in C/C++”

Based on the samples analysis, we observed the malware code
written in C/C++ and a bit of ASM.

“Raccoon collects:
passwords, cookies and
autocomplete from all popular
browsers (including FireFox
x64), CC data”

By default (a specific configuration is not needed), the malware
samples collect data from browsers SQL databases.

“Raccoon collects system
information”

The malware fingerprints the infected system using Windows
Registry queries and other WinApi functions (e.g. RAM, CPU,
display, installed softwares).

“almost all existing desktop
cryptocurrency wallets”

It is confirmed by the malware configuration which embeds
many cryptocurrency wallets browser extensions and Desktop
apps. The configuration can be customized to collect data from
other wallets, just by setting the path and the targeted file.

“Built-in file downloader”

The malware implements its own directory listening function to
grab files.

“Works on both 32 and 64-bit
systems without
dependencies on .NET.”

The malware doesn’t need any dependencies, it rather
downloads 8 DLLs once executed.

“Private key, gate address
and all other string values are
heavily encrypted.”

C2 address(es) and strings are encrypted using (RC4 and
Base64), not heavily, perhaps raccoonstealer used this term for
marketing? Does the private key correspond to the RC4 key,
stored in the .rdata section?

“HTTP for sending to
handlers and file servers are
encrypted.”

We didn’t observed any encryption of exfiltrated data.

“Screenshot, system info,
each browser profile is sent
separately. Each wallet – sent
separately”

Quite discriminating, the malware sends data each time it
collects a new one: the system information, the browsers data,
the wallets data (for each wallet extension/desktop found) and
the screenshot.

“Reworked file grabber (…)
going through all disks
including usb with search
depth”

The malware implements its own directory listening function to
grab files.

5/15

Descriptions from the
raccoonstealer‘s Telegram

SEKOIA.IO‘s commentary

“The weight of the executable
file of the Stiller is only 50 KB”

All stand-alone observed samples are 55KB or 56KB.

“We also redesigned the
loader. You can now choose
where to install the file (Low,
Temp, AppData).
CMD/DLL/EXE”

Two ways to execute a payload are implemented in the
malware, but we only took a look at the downloaded PE
execution function.

Figure 4. Comparative table of features shared by raccoonstealer and the SEKOIA.IO’s analysis
Almost all the capabilities or technical details advertised by raccoonstealer, correspond to those
observed during our malware analysis. Some properties of the malware are quite generic
(collecting browser data and system information, capturing screenshot, encrypting the C2 address
and strings) among the information stealing malware family, but others are rather specific and
validate the attribution to Raccoon (sending data separately, the built-in file downloader, the file
grabber going through all disks, and the specific loader).
It is worth mentioning that the authors announce that Raccoon Stealer v2 exfiltrate encrypted data ,
but we didn’t observe any encryption or obfuscation in C2 communications during our analysis.
This seems to be the only point that differs between the raccoonstealer‘s advertising and our
observations. However, it should not be forgotten that their goal is to market the malware, and they
might overuse some expressions to do so. Indeed, we have already seen such discrepancies on
the MarsTeam‘s publications about Mars Stealer on the XSS forum2.
In addition, the date of appearance of the first samples matches that of the aforementioned
“Raccoon Stealer 2.0” servers, as well as the date of the publication of raccoonstealer in their
Telegram channel (arround May 17, 2022).

Technical analysis
In the raccoonstealer‘s Telegram channel, the new version of the malware has been advertised
with an improved software, back-end and front-end. Raccoon Stealer’s developers rewrote the
malware and the administration panel from scratch, with a focus on performance and efficiency. In
the next part, SEKOIA.IO analysed the malware and its communication in depth.

Malware capabilities
Raccoon Stealer’s capabilities are those of a classic stealer, with a focus on cryptocurrency
wallets. The malware is also advertised as a loader and a file grabber.
Here is an overview of its capabilities:
Targeting of popular browsers (to steal passwords, cookies, autoforms and credit cards);

6/15

Targeting of almost all desktop cryptocurrency wallets and extension for cryptocurrency
wallets (MetaMask, TronLink, BinanceChain, Ronin, Exodus, Atomic, JaxxLiberty, Binance,
Coinomi, Electrum, Electrum-LTC, ElectronCash, etc.);
File downloading;
File loading (cmd, dll, exe);
File grabbing in all disks;
Screenshot capturing;
System fingerprinting;
Installed applications listing.
The capabilities advertised on Telegram match those identified during our analysis.

In-depth analysis
Raccoon Stealer v2 is written in C/C++ using WinApi. Sample size is around 56KB, working on
both 32 and 64-bit systems without any dependencies. The malware downloads legitimate thirdparty DLLs from its C2 server(s). The C2 configuration and strings are encrypted using RC4 and
Base64 encoding.
SEKOIA.IO reverse engineered the malware and will soon publish an in-depth analysis to share
further details.
In the meantime, here is a description of the step-by-step execution of Raccoon Stealer v2:
1. Dynamic Loading of DLLs;
2. Run-Time Dynamic Linking of WinApi functions;
3. Strings deobfuscation (base64 decoding and RC4 decryption);
4. C2 server(s) deobfuscation;
5. Checks (mutex, user privileges);
6. Host fingerprint (MachineGuid, Username) and data exfiltration;
7. Retrieving its configuration from its C2;
8. Downloading, then loading the legitimate third-party DLLs;
9. Fingerprint the infected host (CPU, RAM, OS version, Display info) and send this data to the
C2;
10. Collecting personal information and exfiltrating it (system information, browsers, crypto
wallets);
11. Capturing a screenshot and exfiltrating it;
12. Removal of files created by the malware.
Interestingly, during the collection stage, the malware collects the data and sends it directly in a file
via a POST request to the C2 server. It repeats this step for each new type of data (system
information, cookies, screenshot, etc.).
It is worth noting that the malware implements almost no defense evasion techniques, such as antianalysis, obfuscation, or impair defenses.

Network communications
The malware first sends a POST request to its C2 server with the machineId, username and
configurationId (which corresponds to the RC4 key). The server replies with the full malware
configuration including, as shown in the following figure:
Applications to target;
URLs hosting the legitimate third-party DLLs;
Token used for data extraction (corresponds to the C2’s endpoint);
File grabber configuration, etc.

Figure 5. Network capture of the communication initiated by the malware on the infected machine
and its C2 server
Raccoon Stealer v2 then downloads every DLLs, which are sometimes hosted on another server.
Finally, it exfiltrates data by sending POST requests to its C2 server. The URLs used by the
malware are built using the token received in the configuration.

10/15

Figure 6. Overview of Raccoon Stealer v2 communications
To conclude, we expect a resurgence of Raccoon Stealer v2, as developers implemented a
version tailored to the needs of cybercriminals (efficiency, performance, stealing capabilities, etc.)
and scaled their backbone servers to handle large loads. In addition, the malware benefits of the
threat actors’ popularity gained in recent years.
We can assess with high confidence that possible future updates will implement more anti-analysis
techniques to avoid detection by antiviruses.
