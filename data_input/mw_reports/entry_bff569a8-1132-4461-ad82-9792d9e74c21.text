Exploit kits (EK) are not as widespread as they used to be. One of the reasons is likely that
most exploit kits targeted software that is hardly ever used anymore. Internet Explorer,
Silverlight, and Flash Player to name a few, have been deprecated, replaced, and quickly
lost their user-base.
So, just when you start thinking there is one less threat to worry much about, researchers
have found an exploit kit with a keen interest in Chrome. Which, from a business point of
view, makes a lot of sense, since Chrome is close to becoming not just a market leader, but
almost a monopolist in the browser market.
Chrome has, at the time of writing, a market share of around 65%. The only other browser
that reaches a market share that is over 10% is Safari. So if you are in the business of
compromising browsers that visit your website or watch your advertisement, having Chrome
users on your target list is a big plus.
Or, as Malwarebytes’ Director of Threat Intelligence, Jérôme Segura, put it:
“The future of exploit kits is via Chrome exploits. This could either be an anomaly or
the beginning of a new era with big implications for the years to come.”

Magnitude EK
Enter the Magnitude exploit kit. Researchers have found that the Magnitude EK is actively
using two vulnerabilities to exploit Chromium-based browsers. Magnitude is used in
malvertising attacks to infect victims who visit compromised websites and its payload of
choice is the Magniber ransomware.

The vulnerabilities
CVE-2021-21224 is described as a type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to
90.0.4430.85 which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via
a crafted HTML page. V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and
WebAssembly engine. This vulnerability was patched in April.
CVE-2021-31956 is a Windows NTFS Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability. This
vulnerability can be used in combination with CVE-2021-21224 to escape the Chromium
sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in June.

PuzzleMaker
Practically the same combination of vulnerabilities was described in June when Microsoft
fixed seven zero-days, including the CVE-2021-131956 we mentioned earlier. Back then, the
attacker using these vulnerabilities was dubbed PuzzleMaker. At the time it was unknown
which Chrome vulnerability was used by the attacker, but it’s highly likely that it was the
same as Magnitude has been found leveraging now.

Payload
There is no malicious payload attached to the Magnitude exploits yet, the attack just
exfiltrates the victim’s Windows build number. But reportedly, this is Magnitude EK’s standard
procedure to test out new exploits, so this could change quickly if they start to see positive
results.

How to protect yourself
It is only on rare occasions that we write about vulnerabilities and then tell you there isn’t
much to worry about. But in this case, the only people that have anything to worry about are
Windows users that browse the web using Chrome or Chromium based browsers (like
Edge), but have disabled its automatic updates and haven’t updated since April. You would
also have to run on a non-updated Windows system since June, or run Chrome with the –nosandbox switch (not recommended). And even then all that would happen if you ran across
the Magnitude EK (which usually focuses on South Korea) is getting fingerprinted.
But you do understand that you should update your OS and browser nonetheless, right?

Enable automatic updates
If you want to save yourself the trouble of manually installing updates, there are a few things
you can do. For Google Chrome (under Windows) you can choose this page as one of the
tabs that opens when you run the browser: chrome://settings/help. If there has been an
update since the last time you closed your browser, this page will alert you and initiate a
download of the update.
In Windows 10 you can select the Start button, then select Settings > Update & security >
Windows Update. Select Advanced options, and then under Choose how updates are
installed, select Automatic (recommended).
Stay safe, everyone!
