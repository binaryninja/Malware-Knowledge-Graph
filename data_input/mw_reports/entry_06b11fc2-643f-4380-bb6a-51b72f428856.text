Change in Perspective on the Utility of SUNBURSTrelated Network Indicators
domaintools.com/resources/blog/change-in-perspective-on-the-utility-of-sunburst-related-network-indicators

If you would prefer to listen to The DomainTools Research team discuss their
analysis, it is featured in our recent episode of Breaking Badness, which is included at
the bottom of this post.

Background
Since initial disclosure first by FireEye then Microsoft in mid-December 2020, additional
entities from Volexity to Symantec to CrowdStrike (among others) have released further
details on a campaign variously referred to as “the SolarWinds event,” “SUNBURST,” or
“Solorigate.” DomainTools provided an independent analysis of network infrastructure,
defensive recommendations, and possible attribution items in this time period as well.
Yet, perhaps the most in-depth analysis of the intrusion at the time of this writing was
published by Microsoft on 20 January 2021. Among other interesting observations,
Microsoft’s most-recent reporting identified the following items:
Incredibly high levels of Operational Security (OPSEC) displayed by the attackers to
avoid identification or ultimate discovery of the SUNBURST backdoor.

1/8

Narrowly-tailored operations with not only per-victim but even per-host unique Cobalt
Strike configurations, file naming conventions, and other artifacts of adversary
behaviors.
Likely use of victim-specific Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, including
unique domains and hosting IPs, to further obfuscate operations while limiting the
efficacy of indicator-based analysis and alerting.
The above discoveries emphasize that an indicator-centric approach to defending against a
SUNBURST-like attack will fail given this adversary’s ability and willingness to avoid
indicator reuse. Furthermore, as revealed by CrowdStrike, MalwareBytes, and potentially
Mimecast, we also know that the “SolarWinds actor” leverages additional initial infection
vectors (most notably abuse of Office365, Azure Active Directory, and related Microsoftbased cloud services). Therefore, multiple entities aside from those using the affected
versions of SolarWinds Orion software must be cognizant of and actively defending against
this actor’s operations—yet a defense based on indicator alerting and blocking will fail given
this actor’s OPSEC capabilities.

SUNBURST-Related Command and Control Overview
Based on reporting from multiple vendors, there was already strong suspicion that
SUNBURST and related campaign network infrastructure was likely victim-specific at least
during certain stages of the intrusion. As seen in the image below, for the SUNBURSTspecific infection vector, C2 behaviors move through three distinct stages: the initial DNS
communication to the common first-stage C2 node (avsvmcloud[.]com); the follow-on
receipt and communication to a second-stage C2 node passed via a Canonical Name
(CNAME) response to the initial DNS request; and finally a third-stage C2 corresponding to
the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload installed on victim machines.

In Microsoft’s reporting from 20 January 2021, we see confirmation that while first and
second stage C2 activity likely feature commonality among victims, third stage Cobalt Strike
Beacon-related activity includes not only per-victim uniqueness but potentially per-host
uniqueness as well:

2/8

In this scenario, individual indicators (domains or IP addresses) are effectively useless after
the initial SUNBURST stages, and potentially completely impractical for non-SolarWinds
infection vectors used by this adversary. Instead of Indicator of Compromise (IOC)-based
defense, defenders need to migrate to identifying behavioral and infrastructure patterns to
flag infrastructure potentially related to this incident.

Patterns, or the Lack Thereof
At the time of this writing, across multiple vendors, there are 29 domains with associated IP
addresses linked to SUNBURST and related activity with high confidence.

Using previous DomainTools research as a guide, we can identify some “weak” patterns,
such as clustering around certain registrars, authoritative name servers, and hosting
providers when these items were active—note that most of the items on this list are
currently sinkholed. Yet the identified patterns are somewhat weak and overlap with a
number of other activities, both legitimate and malicious, making pivoting and further
infrastructure discovery very difficult, if not outright impossible.
From a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) perspective, pivoting and indicator analysis may
seem to be a dead-end. The following items hold, to a greater or lesser extent, for all
observed domains in this campaign:

5/8

The use of what appear to be older domains (re-registered, potentially “taken over” by
the threat actor, or potentially part of a “stockpile” of infrastructure kept for later use).
Reliance on cloud hosting providers (such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft
Azure) for domain hosting.
Use of relatively common (if also typically suspicious) registration patterns to likely
“hide” in the noise of domain registration activity.
Combined, these observations make enrichment seem, on its face, somewhat pointless.
However, while these items may be difficult or impossible to use from either a predictive
(identifying new infrastructure) or historical (identifying infrastructure used by the adversary,
but not previously associated to it in an identified incident) external CTI analysis
perspective, there remain options for network defenders. Most significantly, the patterns
identified in the items observed to date, though insufficient for external discovery on its own,
may be more than sufficient for internal defensive response and alerting purposes.

Operationalizing Network Observables for Active Defense
Changing our perspective from external analysis to internal enrichment of observables
yields interesting and powerful detection scenarios. In the case of SUNBURST and related
intrusions, the adversary succeeds in subverting critical trust relationships (with SolarWinds
Orion or Microsoft cloud services) to attain initial access to victim environments. But in order
to actually take advantage of this subversion, the adversary requires some mechanism of
communicating with and controlling the deployed capability. At this stage, defenders can
take advantage of this critical attacker dependency to identify that something is amiss.
One simple way of approaching the subject would be to flag new, unknown domains
referenced in network communications for further scrutiny. This may sound potentially
useful at first, but given the vast diversity of domains and the likely noise generated by user
activity (or even programmatic actions), such an approach dooms itself rapidly to alert
fatigue and failure.
Yet this just represents a barely enriched, minimal context way of observing network
infrastructure items referenced in an organization’s overall network communication activity.
If we, as defenders and responders, can add additional context and nuance to observed
items and utilize this for alerting purposes, powerful possibilities emerge. Combining
internal network understanding with automated observable or indicator enrichment enables
rapid, contextual network defense which can quickly identify suspicious communication
patterns.
For example, rather than simply responding to any instance of “new” network items
observed, organizations may limit this response to critical services, servers, or network
enclaves (e.g., the subnet containing various infrastructure devices). Proper network
segmentation, asset identification and asset tagging to identify critical items, such as
6/8

SolarWinds Orion servers or various items such as email servers or Domain Controllers,
can allow for focused response when a significant asset initiates a previously unseen
external connection.
From a network observable perspective, just identifying that something is “new” can be
replaced with enrichment to identify observable characteristics of interest: hosting provider,
hosting location, registrar, authoritative name server, or SSL/TLS certificate characteristics.
Identifying and alerting on combinations of these through automated enrichment—such as
through DomainTools Iris Enrich or security monitoring plugins such as DomainTools
integration with Splunk—can allow for higher fidelity, higher confidence alarms related to
observed network communications. In the case of the SUNBURST-related items, even the
per-victim unique items associated with follow-on CobaltStrike activity, identifying domains
matching certain criteria in terms of name server and registrar associated with historical
suspicious activity combined with the new observation can enable security teams to vector
resources for follow-on investigation based on the greater level of detail provided.
For a truly game-changing defensive posture that fully amplifies defender advantages in
both owning the network and monitoring activity emerging from it, these perspectives can
be combined. In this scenario, high-confidence alerting on suspicious external network
items post-enrichment is fused with internal asset identification to narrow this
communication to a high-value asset or sensitive enclave within the network. The
subsequent alert represents a truly critical alarm enriching on both target and adversary
infrastructure aspects to focus response and drive an ensuing investigation.

7/8

Conclusion
The theoretical alerting scenario described above, where internal and external enrichment
are combined to yield high-confidence, high-fidelity alarms, may appear out of reach for
many organizations—but given advances in adversary tradecraft, it represents where we as
defenders must drive operations. Although initially difficult to create, given both the network
engineering and segmentation requirements for an accurate asset or network enclave
detection, as well as the establishment of logging and enrichment pipelines for observed
network indicators, once in place, an organization will find itself on a much more robust and
powerful security footing.
Once attained, even the most complex and stealthy attacks such as the trust-abusing
intrusions linked to SolarWinds and Microsoft services can be detected. While subsequent
investigation and analysis may remain hard, as highlighted in Microsoft’s January 2021
analysis, at the very least defenders now have an opportunity to investigate and search for
further signs of malicious activity within the network. Absent the enrichment scenarios
described above, defenders yield own-network advantages and investigation initiative to
intruders, and place themselves in a position where an adversary mistake or migration
away from high-OPSEC activity is necessary to enable detection and response.
By combining own-network understanding and identification with automated indicator
enrichment through services such as DomainTools, defenders can take back the initiative
from intruders and detect or even cut off initial C2 beacon activity. In this manner, defenders
not only adapt to but can disadvantage intruders to shift the landscape of network defense
back in the network owner’s favor.
