A new information stealing Trojan called Evrial is being sold on criminal forums and being
actively distributed in the wild. Like most infostealing Trojans, Evrial can steal browser
cookies and stored credentials, but this Trojan also has the ability to monitor the Windows
clipboard for certain text, and if detected, modify it to something else.
First discovered and tracked by security researchers MalwareHunterTeam and Guido Not
CISSP, by monitoring the Windows clipboard for certain strings, Evrial makes it easy for
attackers to hijack cryptocurrency payments and Steam trades. This is done by replacing
legitimate payment addresses and URLs with addresses under the attacker's control.
Fresh Evrial sample (at 8/67): https://t.co/ClNOvw2GbS
Interesting that previous versions had 20-30 (or more after some time on VT) detections, with
only 2 features. Now it has all the features from Reborn Stealer (previously Ovidiy), and now
it's under 10...

Evrial being sold on criminal forums
According to MalwareHunterTeam, Evrial is currently being sold on Russian criminal forums
for 1,500 Rubles or ~ $27 USD. In the advertisement, the seller states that after purchasing
the product, an attacker gains access to a web panel that allows them to build an executable.
This web panel also keeps track of what clipboard modifications have taken place and allows
an attacker to configure what replacement strings should be used.

Evrial takes control of the Windows clipboard
Evrial's most interesting feature is that it will monitor the Windows clipboard for certain
types of strings and replace them with ones sent by the attacker. This allows the attacker to
reroute a cryptocurrency payment to an address under their control. While clipboard
monitoring is common with programs like this, MalwareHunterTeam has told
BleepingComputer that modifications are much more rare.
For example, bitcoin addresses are not the easiest string of text to type into a program or
website. Due to this, when someone sends bitcoins to an exchange or wallet, they typically
copy the address that the coins should be sent to into the Windows clipboard and then paste
that address into the other app or site that is performing the sending.
When Evrial detects a bitcoin address in the clipboard, it replaces that legitimate address
with one under the attacker's control. The victim then pastes that address into their app,
thinking its the legitimate one and not realizing its been replaced, and clicks send. Now when
the bitcoins are sent, they go to the attackers address rather than your intended recipient.
Evrial is configured to detects strings that correspond to Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero,
WebMoney, Qiwi addresses and Steam items trade urls.

Detecting Strings in the Windows Clipboard

When Evrial detects one of the supported strings in the clipboard, it will connect to a remote
site, upload the original string, and then download a string that it should be used as the
replacement.

Replacing String in Clipboard

As the string has now been replaced in the clipboard, when the victim performs a paste into a
program, the attacker's string will be used instead.

Evrial steals passwords documents
In addition to monitoring and modifying the clipboard, Evrial will also steal bitcoin wallets,
stored passwords, documents from the victim's desktop, and a screenshot of the active
windows. All of this information will be compiled into a zip file and uploaded to the attackers
web panel as shown below.

4/7

Evrial will determine the location of Bitcoin's wallet.dat file from querying a registry key. If
the key exists, it will then steal that wallet so it can gain access to the victim's bitcoins.

Find Bitcoin wallet.dat Location

Evrial will also attempt to steal credentials stored in browsers. The browsers targeted by
Evrial include Chrome, Yandex, Orbitum, Opera, Amigo, Torch, and Comodo.

Steal Browser Credentials
5/7

Evrial will also attempt to steal credentials stored in Pidgin and Filezilla.

Steal FileZilla Credentials

Last, but not least, Evrial will steal cookies & documents found on a desktop.

Steal Cookies

All of this data, plus a screenshot of the active window, will be uploaded to a remote server so
it can be accessed by the attacker.

How to protect yourself from Evrial
At this time it not 100% known how Evrial is being distributed, but the best way to protect
yourself is to practice good computing habits. Make sure that you have security software
installed, that you scan attachments that you receive using a site like VirusTotal, and that you
practice good and safe computing habits.
