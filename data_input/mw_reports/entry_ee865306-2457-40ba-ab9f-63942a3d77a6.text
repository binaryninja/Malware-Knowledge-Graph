Gamaredon APT Group Use Covid-19 Lure in Campaigns

Gamaredon is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been active since 2013. Their campaigns are generally known for targeting Ukrainian government
institutions. From late 2019 to February of this year, researchers published several reports on Gamaredon, tracking the group’s activities.
In March, we came across an email with a malware attachment that used the Gamaredon group’s tactics. Some of the emails used the coronavirus pandemic as a topic
to lure victims into opening emails and attachments. These campaigns targeted victims in European countries and others.

A brief history of Gamaredon
In 2015, researchers from LookingGlass published the ﬁrst report on Gamaredon. According to that report, the early campaigns used Microsoft Word documents that,
when inspected, showed that its most recent user went by the name of Armagedon (a misspelled “Armageddon”), which became the basis of the group’s namesake.
The report also described Gamaredon’s political beginnings, particularly its ties to the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. Before the revolution they had targeted
Ukrainian government ofﬁcials, opposition party members, and journalists. They moved on to Ukrainian government institutions after the revolution. In 2018, CERTUA published an advisory against the malware Pterodo, which the group allegedly used.
The group remained active, with several Gamaredon-related activities reported in February 2020. In March, they were among the threat groups that were identiﬁed
taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to trick targets.

Gamaredon APT Group Use Covid-19 Lure in Campaigns - TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog

Figure 1. The infection chain of the Gamaredon campaign
The case we found arrived through a targeted email that contained a document ﬁle (in docx format). Opening document starts a template injection technique for
loading the document template from the internet. The downloaded document template contains the malicious macro codes, which executes a VBScript (VBS). We
found a mechanism for decrypting, executing, and downloading an additional payload from the C&C server. During the time of the analysis however, the C&C server
was not accessible, which made us unable to get additional payloads.
The attacks we found all arrived through targeted emails (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1193). One of them even had the subject “Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).”
The use of socially relevant topics is a common practice for attackers who wish to make their emails and documents more tempting to open. The email that used the
coronavirus-related subject came with an attached document ﬁle. Opening this ﬁle (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1204) executes the template injection method
(MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1221).

Figure 2. Code for downloading the document template with the malicious macro
The downloaded document template (in dot format) could differ slightly depending on each download. However, its Exif info or metadata remains consistent and
shares the following details:
Identiﬁcation: Word 8.0
Language code: Russian
System: Windows
Author: АДМИН (“Administrator” in Russian)
Code page: Windows Cyrillic

Figure 3. A sample of malicious macro in the downloaded template document
As mentioned, the template contains malicious macro (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064), which exports VBS (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064) to
execute itself. More speciﬁcally it drops “%USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbs,” which is hardcoded in the macro, and then executed in
“wscript.exe //b %USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbs.”

Figure 4. A content sample for VBS dropped by malicious macro
PlayList.vbs contains the obfuscated codes (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1140), which it executes after decrypting the obfuscations. This particular behavior is
a slight departure from previously reported attacks by Gamaredon, which did not use this technique.

Figure 5. A sample of executed VBS
Figure 5 shows a snippet of the VBS executed by the Execute function. The routines it follows are enumerated below.
1. Register the RUN key in the registry below, so that the VBS ﬁle is executed every time the machine starts (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1060)
Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\MediaPlayer wscript.exe //b
％USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbs
2. Connect with “hxxp:// kristom[.]hopto[.]org /{computer name}_{hexadecimal volume serious number}/help_05_03[.]php” (MITRE ATT&CK framework IDs
T1043, T1071, T1082)
3. If the downloaded ﬁle size in the ﬁrst step exceeds 10,485 bytes, then the ﬁle is saved as “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.txt” (MITRE ATT&CK
framework ID T1105)
4. Use XOR for the ﬁle saved from the second step, where ASCII code converted from its own hexadecimal volume serial number is used as the key. The
decrypted result is saved as “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” (T1001)
5. If the ﬁle size of “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” exceeds 4,485 bytes, it is executed.
6. Both “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.txt” and “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” are then deleted (MITRE ATT&CK
framework ID T1107)
The observed routines of this VBS closely follow the other reports published on Gamaredon, such as the one from SentinelOne. However, the macro generated VBS
was obfuscated in this case, likely as an additional evasive tactic.
Interestingly, after decoding the VBS, we saw what appeared to be a programming mistake by the attacker. Lines 53 and 54 in ﬁgure 6 are for closing those
downloaded and decoded TXT and EXE ﬁles, which are variables deﬁned right before the IF statement. If, however, these lines do not pass through this IF statement,
an error would occur. It shows that this malware is not tested enough, and may still be under development.
Our analysis found several URLs of the network destinations for both template injection and VBS. While resolving them to IP addresses to understand their attack
bases, we also found that they were all linked to the following IP addresses.
Network destination for template injection: 176[.]119[.]147[.]225
Network destination for VBS: 176[.]57[.]215[.]115
These IP addresses are from Russian hosting companies. Most likely, the attackers rented Virtual Private Server (VPS) as their attack base. Their URL for VBS
(shown below) likely includes the data when they conducted the attack.
hxxp://{FQDN}/{computer name}_{hexadecimal volume serial number}/help_{day}_{month}[.]php

Conclusion
Gameradon is not the ﬁrst group to take advantage of the Covid-19 topic. Some cybercriminals have taken to indirect means of proﬁting, such as by targeting
communication platforms that have increased in popularity after organizations shifted to work from home setups. In this case, they used Covid-19 as a cover for their
relatively typical APT routine. We recommend these countermeasures to prevent similar APT attacks in the future:

Check the email sender, subject, and body for anything suspicious before downloading and opening email attachments. Be especially wary of unsolicited
emails, that come from unknown senders.
Check the ﬁle extension of the attached ﬁle and make sure it is the intended ﬁle format.
Avoid activating macro for any attached Microsoft Ofﬁce ﬁles, especially for emails that request macro activation using an image of the body of the opened ﬁle
or those that don’t show anything.
Watch out for spoofed domains embedded in emails before opening them. Subtle changes to a popular URL can be one indicator of malicious content.
In addition to these actions, users can also implement a multi-layer approach and take advantage of these solutions.

Security Predictions for 2020

Cybersecurity in 2020 will be viewed through many lenses — from differing attacker motivations and cybercriminal arsenal to technological developments and
global threat intelligence — only so defenders can keep up with the broad range of threats.
Read our security predictions for 2020.

Business Process Compromise

Attackers are starting to invest in long-term operations that target speciﬁc processes enterprises rely on. They scout for vulnerable practices, susceptible
systems and operational loopholes that they can leverage or abuse. To learn more, read our Security 101: Business Process Compromise.
