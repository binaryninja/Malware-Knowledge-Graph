In an indictment unsealed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Aug. 1, 2018, three
Ukrainian nationals have been charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, computer hacking,
access device fraud and aggravated identity theft. Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33,
and Andrii Kopakov, 30, are suspected to be key members within CARBON SPIDER’s point
of sale (POS) subgroup.
The arrests took place between January and June 2018, and coincided with a slowdown in
CARBON SPIDER activity. The DoJ announcement also details the group’s use of a front
company, named Combi Security, to recruit developers and intrusion specialists for its
operations. Given that other members of this subgroup remain at large, it is likely that the
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) may change but activity will continue.
CARBON SPIDER, more widely known as the Carbanak group, is a long-standing criminal
enterprise responsible for compromising banks to transfer funds to mule accounts,
performing ATM jackpotting attacks, and conducting mass compromise of debit and credit
cards from POS terminals in large enterprises. They have been active in some form since at

1/13

least 2013. During that time, the group has focused on the banking, financial, media,
technology, hospitality, and food and beverage verticals, using targeted campaigns to reach
their objectives.

Untangling the CARBON SPIDER Web
The structure of CARBON SPIDER is very complex and was initially suspected to be a
single group, based on their use of several custom tools and specific TTPs. However,
further research into the structure indicates that there are several clusters of activity likely
made up of subgroups serving different missions, potentially with access to a shared
development environment and pool of resources. A complex structure such as this is
difficult to manage and speaks to the sophistication of the actor.
This blog aims to examine CARBON SPIDER over time and attempts to describe their
changing relationship within the eCrime ecosystem.

Custom Tools
CARBON SPIDER has leveraged many custom tools since it began activity in 2013,
including its primary implant Sekur (a.k.a. Anunak). These include the following:

Sekur has been CARBON SPIDER’s primary tool for several years, although usage over
the last year appears to have declined. It contains all the functionality you would expect
from a RAT, allowing the adversary to execute commands, manage the file system, manage
processes, and collect data. In addition, it can record videos of victim sessions, log
keystrokes, enable remote desktop, or install Ammyy Admin or VNC modules. From July
2014 on, samples were compiled with the capability to target Epicor POS systems and to
collect credit card data.

Agent ORM began circulating alongside Sekur in campaigns throughout the second half of
2015. The malware collects basic system information and is able to take screenshots of
victim systems. It is used to download next-stage payloads when systems of interest are

identified. It is strongly suspected that Agent ORM has been deprecated in favor of scriptbased first-stage implants (VB Flash, JS Flash, and Bateleur).

IOAs: Attacker methodology; Suspicious activity

VB Flash was first observed being deployed alongside Agent ORM in September 2015. It is
likely that this was developed as a replacement to Agent ORM and contained similar
capabilities. The first observed instance of VB Flash included comments and was easy to
analyze—later versions soon began to integrate multiple layers of obfuscation. Several
versions of VB Flash were developed including ones that utilized Google Forms, Google
Macros, and Google Spreadsheets together to make a command-and-control (C2) channel.
This variant would POST victim data to a specified Google form, then make a request to a
Google macro script, receiving an address for a Google Spreadsheet from which to request
commands.

JS Flash capabilities closely resemble those of VB Flash and leverage interesting
techniques in deployment via batch scripts embedded as OLE objects in malicious
documents. Many iterations of JS Flash were observed being tested before deployment,
containing minor changes to obfuscation and more complex additions, such as the ability to
download TinyMet (a cutdown of the Metasploit Meterpreter payload). PowerShell was also
used heavily for the execution of commands and arbitrary script execution. No JS Flash
samples were observed being deployed after November 2017.

Bateleur deployments began not long after JS Flash and were also written in JavaScript.
Deployments were more infrequent and testing was not observed. It is likely that Bateleur
was run in parallel as an alternative tool and eventually replaced JS Flash as CARBON

5/13

SPIDER’s first stage tool of choice. Although much simpler in design than JS Flash, all
executing out of a single script with more basic obfuscation, Bateleur has a wealth of
capabilities—including the ability to download arbitrary scripts and executables, deploy
TinyMet, execute commands via PowerShell, deploy a credential stealer, and collect victim
system information such as screenshots.

Clusters of Activity
Based on the use of these tools, it is possible to group the CARBON SPIDER activity into
several clusters. These clusters may represent different groups with a common tool supply
chain, or isolated campaigns from the same group, using separate individuals to carry out
attacks with a different focus.
Point of Sale (POS) Targeting
Target
Region

Primarily U.S. and Western Europe

Target
Sector

Enterprises that process many card transactions (in particular casinos,
hotels, and restaurant chains)

Active
From

At least mid 2015

Active To

Current

The POS cluster is the most prolific associated to the CARBON SPIDER actor and is also
known as FIN7. This cluster has used all the custom tools described with VB Flash, JS
Flash, and Bateleur that are unique to them. Over time, they have used targeted spear
phishing emails to deploy malicious documents that initially used exploits; more recently,
they have used macros and OLE embedded objects. The primary method of cash out for
this group is the acquisition and sale of credit and debit card dumps from POS devices.
Many of the stolen cards are sold as collectives on the eCrime marketplace, Joker’s Stash.
Targeting of Russian Financial Institutions
Target Region

Russia

Target Sector

Financial and banking

Active From

Late 2013

Active To

Early 2015

6/13

This cluster can also be described as the original Carbanak group. It is suspected that they
stole large sums of money using several cash out methods against Russian banks, at which
point the group may have diverged. It is likely that they developed the primary CARBON
SPIDER implant Sekur and were, at the point of being operational, probably the only users
of it.
Targeting of Middle Eastern Financial Institutions
Target Region

Middle East and South Asia

Target Sector

Financial and banking

Active From

October 2014

Active To

Activity reported up to at least early 2016

Although the targeting profile is the same as the Russian banking cluster, the TTPs are very
different. In particular, the use of tooling stands out from other clusters of CARBON SPIDER
activity. As with other clusters, the primary infection vector is targeted spear phishing emails
that use exploits for a variety of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office:
CVE-2015-2545
CVE-2014-4114
CVE-2015-1770
CVE-2015-1641
A custom .NET first stage payload is deployed that in some cases deploys Agent ORM or
Sekur, but is also used to deploy NetWire. Instances of DarkComet and Morphine RAT use
some custom .NET downloader servers as their C2. One possibility is that CARBON
SPIDER outsourced deployment of their malware for this campaign. An alternative theory is
that this is a seperate group also using CARBON SPIDER tools. Little is reported publicly
about the successfulness of this cluster of activity, and no cash out methods are known.
Targeting of Eastern European Financial Institutions
Target Region

Ukraine and Eastern Europe

Target Sector

Likely financial and banking

Active From

Mid-2015

Active To

Last known activity in late 2015

The Eastern European banking cluster is based on a single campaign using a strategic web
compromise of an Italian bank in Ukraine to deploy instances of Agent ORM to likely
Ukrainian targets. It is likely that this cluster links to one of the other clusters of Sekur
7/13

activity, possibly the unattributed activity discussed below. However, no follow-on actions
have been observed past Agent ORM deployment.
Unattributed
Target
Region

Where known (appears to be Ukraine)

Target
Sector

Not known in most cases (one case focused on news and media
organizations)

Active From

May 2015

Active To

At least January 2017

The unattributed activity is based on a cluster of Sekur activity that runs in parallel with the
POS cluster of activity, but does not exhibit the same TTPs (with differences in Sekur
configuration, campaigns, and infrastructure selection). Many of these samples were
submitted from Ukraine; additionally, one of them was deployed using a malicious document
with a decoy that suggests Ukrainian news and media targeting. It is possible that this
activity relates to the Eastern European bank cluster of Agent ORM activity; yet without
further evidence of follow-on activity, it is not possible to determine this cluster’s action on
objectives.

Timeline
Below is a timeline showing the activity of each of the five clusters of CARBON SPIDER
activity:

8/13

The timeline shows that several of these clusters of activity started just after public reporting
of the group (around mid-2015) and that the divergence in activity may have been the result
of this exposure. It also highlights that CARBON SPIDER now likely operates multiple
parallel missions focusing on different regions and sectors.

Links to Other Targeted eCrime Groups
Beyond the described clusters of CARBON SPIDER activity based around their custom
tools, their are also interesting links to other tracked, targeted eCrime activity. This includes
the group dubbed RATPAK SPIDER (also known as Buhtrap) that targets Russian and
Ukrainian financial institutions, a group dubbed Odinaff targeting SWIFT systems
particularly in Eastern Europe, and the group COBALT SPIDER (also known as Cobalt)
that, again, specializes in targeting Russian banks.
RATPAK SPIDER
Operation Buhtrap had a similar target scope (Russian financial) to the first cluster of
CARBON SPIDER activity. Although these have always been tracked as seperate groups,
there is a technical link between payload deployments. A custom macro dropper that would
encode the payload using VB Script notation, and contained the strings “After OnTime” and
“FUCK AV,” was observed in only 19 unique samples across Crowdstrike sample stores.
One of the payloads was an instance of Agent ORM used to targeted casinos; a second
payload also used by CARBON SPIDER was an instance of Sekur. The other six unique
payloads observed being deployed using this custom macro dropper were instances of the
Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) downloader attributed to the Buhtrap group.
Initially, this led to tracking both threats as CARBON SPIDER. Although it now appears that
Buhtrap is likely a separate entity, the use of this shared deployment mechanism — unique
to these two groups — suggests a common supply chain or developer and a closer working
relationship, especially given some similarities in target scope.
Odinaff
A SWIFT compromise was observed in mid-2016, targeting a Ukrainian bank that at the
time was unattributed. Based on similar TTPs, it was hypothesised that this could be
CARBON SPIDER activity; however, although common off-the-shelf tools (such as
Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike) were used, the custom CARBON SPIDER arsenal was not
present. Later, this group was reported in open source as Odinaff. In addition to similar
TTPs, there appeared to be some infrastructure overlap with two IP addresses. One Odinaff
C2 was also reported to be in previous use as a Sekur plugin server. A second IP was also
reported to be used by CARBON SPIDER in a previous campaign. Again, this may just be a
shared hosting provider, but the TTP similarity makes this infrastructure overlap more
noteworthy.
COBALT SPIDER

9/13

The Cobalt group, tracked by CrowdStrike intelligence as COBALT SPIDER, bears many
similarities in the targeting of banks to the Russian cluster of CARBON SPIDER activity.
Both groups also use Cobalt Strike and several other pen-testing tools in their operations;
nevertheless, the two groups appear to be distinct outside of this.
On March 26, 2018, an announcement was made that a Russian citizen identified by
authorities as “Denis K.” was arrested by the Spanish national police in Alicante, Spain. He
was reportedly involved in early CARBON SPIDER targeting of Russian banks and is
suspected of being one of the members of COBALT SPIDER. Although reports suggest that
he may have been a leader of COBALT SPIDER, activity has continued from this group,
suggesting his role was not a key one within this organization. This suggests a link between
the two groups between 2013 and likely, 2015. This is around the time that the dominant
focus for CARBON SPIDER became targeting the POS systems of Western enterprises. It
is possible that at least one individual left CARBON SPIDER and either joined forces with or
created COBALT SPIDER.

Summary
CARBON SPIDER is the pioneer of targeted eCrime activity with some of the largest
publicly attributed success. Their level of sophistication across the clusters of activity makes
them a key player in the eCrime ecosystem. Although there is not enough evidence to
directly link CARBON SPIDER to other targeted criminal groups, it is assessed with high
confidence (based on analysis of artifacts and infrastructure over time) that CARBON
SPIDER shares resources with other notable criminal groups.
There are two possible hypotheses as to how the clusters of CARBON SPIDER activity are
linked. One theory is that they were originally one group that splintered into several with
different focuses. Several of the splinter groups may have maintained access to their
custom tools (e.g., Sekur), while others moved on to work with other actors (e.g., COBALT
SPIDER). A second theory is that CARBON SPIDER operates as distinct groups with
different focuses, but they report to a single management structure. Resources may be
shared between the groups, but each has its own members. At this stage, the first theory
appears to be the most likely.
Based on recently observed tooling and operations, CARBON SPIDER appears to be
focusing their efforts on the POS cluster of activity against the hospitality and restaurant
sector, with no recently reported activity against banks. They also appear to be moving
away from their custom tooling, with no Sekur samples compiled since November 2017 and
fewer samples appearing in live operations.
Going forward, it is likely that CARBON SPIDER will continue operations to target sectors
that give the best financial return for their efforts. For the short term, this will likely mean a
continued focus on POS systems and large enterprises that process them. It is possible that
they may return to target banks, but this would likely be on a small scale with very focused
10/13

operations. CARBON SPIDER will likely move completely away from their old custom
toolset, either developing new tools or using commodity off-the-shelf packages to achieve
their objectives. This is even more assured given the arrests of three members of the most
prolific CARBON SPIDER subgroup.
As CARBON SPIDER adversary groups retool and alter their TTPs CrowdStrike will
continue to track this adversary leveraging FalconX capabilities to combine endpoint
protection, automation and malware analysis to prevent CARBON SPIDER from breaching
our customer networks.
