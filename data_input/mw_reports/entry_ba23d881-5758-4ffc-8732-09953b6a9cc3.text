Flash zero-day exploit deployed by the ScarCruft APT Group
Earlier this year, we deployed new technologies in Kaspersky Lab products to identify and
block zero-day attacks. This technology already proved its effectiveness earlier this year,
when it caught an Adobe Flash zero day exploit (CVE-2016-1010). Earlier this month, our
technology caught another zero-day Adobe Flash Player exploit deployed in targeted
attacks. We believe the attacks are launched by an APT Group we track under the
codename “ScarCruft”.
ScarCruft is a relatively new APT group; victims have been observed in Russia, Nepal, South
Korea, China, India, Kuwait and Romania. The group has several ongoing operations,
utilizing multiple exploits — two for Adobe Flash and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Operation Daybreak appears to have been launched by ScarCruft in March 2016 and
employs a previously unknown (0-day) Adobe Flash Player exploit. It is also possible that the
group deployed another zero day exploit, CVE-2016-0147, which was patched in April.
This exploit caught by our technologies highlights a few very interesting evasion methods,
some of which we haven’t seen before. We describe them below.

Operation Daybreak general information
Operation Daybreak appears to have been launched by unknown attackers to infect high
profile targets through spear-phishing e-mails. To date, we have observed more than two
dozen victims for these attacks.
Although the exact attack vector remains unknown, the targets appear to receive a malicious
link which points to a hacked website where the exploitation kit is hosted. The hacked web
server hosting the exploit kit is associated with the ScarCruft APT and used in another line of
attacks. Certain details, such as using the same infrastructure and targeting, make us
believe that Operation Daybreak is being done by the ScarCruft APT group.
The ScarCruft APT group is a relatively new player and managed to stay under the radar for
some time. In general, their work is very professional and focused. Their tools and
techniques are well above the average. Prior to the discovery of Operation Daybreak, we
observed the ScarCruft APT launching a series of attacks in Operation Erebus. Operation
Erebus leverages another Flash Player exploit (CVE-2016-4117) through the use of watering
hole attacks.
In the case of Operation Daybreak, the hacked website hosting the exploit kit performs a
couple of browser checks before redirecting the visitor to a server controlled by the attackers
hosted in Poland.
The main exploit page script contains a BASE64 decoder, as well as rc4 decryption
implemented in JS.

The parameters sent to the “ap.php” script are randomly generated on each hit, so the
second stage payload gets encrypted differently each time. This prevents easy detection by
MD5 or signatures of the second stage payload.
The exploitation process consists of three Flash objects. The Flash object that triggers the
vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player is located in second SWF delivered to the victim.
At the end of the exploitation chain, the server sends a legitimate PDF file to user –
“china.pdf”. The “china.pdf” file shown to the victims in the last stage of the attack seems to
be written in Korean:

The document text talks about disagreements between China and “The North” over nuclear
programs and demilitarization.

Vulnerability technical details
The vulnerability (CVE-2016-4171) is located in the code which parses the ExecPolicy
metadata information.
This is what the structure looks like:

This structure also contains an array of item_info structures:

The documentation says the following about these structures:

4/12

“The item_info entry consists of item_count elements that are interpreted as key/value pairs
of indices into the string table of the constant pool. If the value of key is zero, this is a keyless
entry and only carries a value.”
In the exploit used by the ScarCruft group, we have the following item_info structures:

Item_info array in exploit object
The code that triggers the vulnerability parses this structure and, for every key and value
members, tries to get the respective string object from string constant pool. The problem
relies on the fact that the “.key” and “.value” members are used as indexes without any kind
of boundary checks. It is easy to understand that if key or value members are larger than
string constant pool array, a memory corruption problem appears. It is also important to
mention that this member’s (value, key) are directly read from SWF object, so an attacker
can easily use them to implement arbitrary read/write operations.

5/12

Getting object by index from constant pool without any checks
Using this vulnerability, the exploit implements a series of writes at specified addresses to
achieve full remote code execution.

Bypassing security solutions through DDE
The Operation Daybreak attack employs multiple stages, which are all outstanding in some
way. One of them attracted our attention because it implements a bypass for security
solutions we have never seen before.
In the first stage of the attack, the decrypted shellcode executed by the exploit downloads
and executes a special DLL file. This is internally called “yay_release.dll”:

Second stage DLL internal name and export

The code of this module is loaded directly into the exploited application and has several
methods of payload execution. One of method uses a very interesting technique of payload
execution which is designed mostly to bypass modern anti-malware products. This uses an
interesting bug in the Windows DDE component. It is not a secret that anti-malware systems
trigger on special system functions that are called in the context of potential vulnerable
applications to make a deeper analysis of API calls such as CreateProcess, WinExec or
ShellExecute.
For instance, such defense technologies trigger if a potentially vulnerable application such as
Adobe Flash starts other untrusted applications, scripts interpreters or even the command
console.
To make execution of payload invisible for these defense systems, the threat actors used the
Windows DDE interface in a very clever way. First, they register a special window for it:

In the window procedure, they post WM_DDE_EXECUTE messages with commands:

Sending WM_DDE_EXECUTE message to window
The attackers used the following commands:

7/12

The main idea here is that if you create a LNK to an executable or command, then use the
ShowGroup method, the program will be executed. This is an undocumented behavior in
Microsoft Windows.
In our case, a malicious VBS was executed, which installs a next stage payload stored in
CAB file:

We have reported this “creative” abuse of DDE to Microsoft’s security team.
The final payload of the attack is a CAB file with the following MD5:

Invalid digital signature on malware samples
The malware deployed in this attack is extremely rare and apparently reserved only for high
profile victims. Our products detect it as well as other malware from ScarCruft as
HEUR:Trojan.Win32.ScarCruft.gen.

Victims:
9/12

Although our visibility is rather limited, some of the victims of these attacks include:
A law enforcement agency in an Asian country
One of the largest trading companies in Asia and in the world
A mobile advertising and app monetization company in the USA
Individuals related to the International Association of Athletics Federations
A restaurant located in one of the top malls in Dubai
Some of these were compromised over the last few days, indicating the attackers are still
very active.

Conclusions:
Nowadays, in-the-wild Flash Player exploits are becoming rare. This is because in most
cases they need to be coupled with a Sandbox bypass exploit, which makes them rather
tricky.
Additionally, Adobe has been doing a great job at implementing new mitigations to make
exploitation of Flash Player more and more difficult.
Nevertheless, resourceful threat actors such as ScarCruft will probably continue to deploy
zero-day exploits against their high profile targets.
As usual, the best defense against targeted attacks is a multi-layered approach. Windows
users should combine traditional anti-malware technologies with patch management, host
intrusion detection and, ideally, allowlisting and default-deny strategies. According to a study
by the Australian DSD, 85% of the targeted attacks analysed could have been stopped by
four simple defense strategies. While it’s impossible to achieve 100% protection, in practice
and most cases all you have to do is increase your defenses to the point where it becomes
too expensive for the attacker – who will just give up and move on to other targets.
Kaspersky products detect flash exploit as HEUR:Exploit.SWF.Agent.gen also our AEP
(Automatic Exploit Prevention) component can successfully detect this attack. Payloads are
detected with HEUR:Trojan.Win32.ScarCruft.gen verdict.
