possible third stage that had keylogger capacities

Activity was found in Piriform network although not on any of the CCleaner customers’ PCs
Following the CCleaner incident last year, we have continued to investigate what happened
and have shared our latest insights at the Security Security Analyst Summit today.
To recap, on September 18, 2017, we disclosed that CCleaner had been targeted by
cybercriminals, in order to distribute malware via the CCleaner installation file. The altered
installation file was downloaded by 2.27 million CCleaner customers worldwide. The malware
was introduced to the build server of Piriform, the company developing CCleaner, some time
between March 11 and July 4, 2017, prior to Avast’s acquisition of Piriform on July 18, 2017.
The first stage of the malware was designed to collect non-sensitive information from
CCleaner users, including, for example, name of the computer, list of installed software, and
a list of running processes. The first stage included downloader capabilities, which were
used to download a second stage binary onto just 40 PCs out of the millions of devices
infected with stage one, making it a highly targeted attack. Up until now, we don’t have any
evidence that a third stage binary has been downloaded onto the affected computers.
However, we have found evidence of activity that could indicate what the intended third stage
of the attack could have looked like.

To eliminate the threat from the Piriform network, we migrated the Piriform build environment
to the Avast infrastructure, replaced all hardware and moved the entire Piriform staff onto the
Avast-internal IT system. We consolidated and inspected the Piriform infrastructure and
computers, and found preliminary versions of the stage one and stage two binaries on these,
and we found evidence of a specialized tool, ShadowPad, which is used by a specific group
of cybercriminals, installed on four Piriform computers.
ShadowPad is a cyber attack platform that cybercriminals deploy in victims’ networks to gain
remote control capabilities, and has been analyzed in the past. The tool was installed on the
four Piriform computers on April 12th, 2017, while the preliminary version of stage two had
been installed on the computers on March 12th, 2017.
The older version of the stage two downloader was contacting CnC servers, but the servers
were no longer functioning by the time we got our hands on the computers, so we cannot say
with 100% certainty what they were supposed to download. However, given the timeline of
the events, we assume that the preliminary stage two downloader installed ShadowPad on
the four Piriform computers. Another clue that lead us to this assumption is that ShadowPad
is believed to be a product of the Chinese hacker group, Axiom, the group likely behind the
CCleaner attack. The connection between Axiom and the CCleaner attack was first
discovered by security researcher Constin Raiu.

ShadowPad plugins found on Piriform PCs
We also found ShadowPad log files that contained encrypted keystrokes from a keylogger
installed on the computers. We discovered that the keylogger’s log was encrypted with the
volume ID of the hard drive and consequently were able to decrypt the key strokes. Looking
into the log, we found out that the keylogger had been active since April 12th, 2017,
recording keystrokes on these computers, including keylogs from Visual Studio and other

2/4

programs. The logged data showed us that the keylogger was functional at that time. The
version of the ShadowPad tool is custom-built, which makes us think it was explicitly built for
Piriform.

Logged keystrokes found on the Piriform computers
By installing a tool like ShadowPad, the cybercriminals were able to fully control the system
remotely while collecting credentials and insights into the operations on the targeted
computer. Besides the keylogger tool, other tools were installed on the four computers,
including a password stealer, and tools with the capacity to install further software and
plugins on the targeted computer remotely.
ShadowPad was installed on the Piriform network and, as far as we can tell from our
investigations up until today, it was not installed on any of the CCleaner customers’
computers, however we believe it was the intended third stage for the CCleaner customers.
While up to 2.27 million CCleaner consumers and businesses had downloaded the infected
CCleaner product, the attackers installed the malicious second stage on just 40 PCs
operated by high-tech and telecommunications companies. We don’t have a sample of a
possible third stage that might have been distributed via the CCleaner attack, and it is not

3/4

clear if it was the attacker’s intention to attack all 40 PCs or just a few or none. We continue
investigating the data dumps from the computers, and will post an update as soon as we
learn more.
