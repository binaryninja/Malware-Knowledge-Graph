Presented by
Christopher Gardner, Principal Reverse Engineer • R&E - Mandiant Advantage Labs

About this talk
In The Sample FLARE analysts present stories of notable malware samples they have
reverse engineered. The FLARE team studies hundreds of malware samples each month
and here they share highlights of real-world malware and analysis techniques. These talks
aim to educate and entertain technical and non-technical attendees alike. In this first
iteration, join Chris Gardner of the FLARE team as he examines the malware gift that keeps
on giving. Even after politely asking it to stop. This talk covers: - How to analyze droppers
that just won’t stop dropping more PE files. - How to extract new payloads when a sample
performs process injection. - Why open-source intelligence is both beautiful and dangerous. What analysis tricks reduced analysis time to a mere 45 hours.
