Chinese state-sponsored cyberespionage gang Naikon, aka Override Panda and Lotus
Panda, has reappeared with a new phishing attack that aims to exfiltrate confidential
information. The APT group was first tracked in 2010 and its infrastructure was first
detected in 2015.

Diving into details
Cluster25 analyzed Lotus Panda and found that it used a spear-phishing email to deliver a
Red team framework beacon, dubbed Viper. While the targets remain unknown,
researchers surmise that it could be a government entity from a South Asian nation.

Kill chain
The spear-phishing email consists of a weaponized document pretending to be a call
for tender.
Two payloads are hidden in the document as document properties.
Viper is described as a “graphical intranet penetration tool that modulates and
enhances the tactics and techniques commonly used during intranet penetration.”
It features more than 80 modules to expedite initial access, privilege escalation,
credential access, persistence, arbitrary command execution, and lateral movement.
The C2 server contains both Viper framework and ARL dashboards.

Noteworthy attacks by Chinese hackers
Cyberespionage group Moshen Dragon is targeting telcos in Central Asia. It is
attempting to sideload malicious DLLs into antivirus solutions to move laterally, steal
credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive information.
APT10 or Cicada was found responsible for a long-term espionage campaign against
Japanese entities. The activities continued from mid-2021 to February 2022.
In March, the Mustang Panda APT was found using a new strain of PlugX RAT.
Dubbed Hodur, the trojan is capable of multiple actions, such as collecting system
details, executing commands, and reading and writing arbitrary files.

The bottom line
Override Panda’s TTPs indicate that it is conducting long-term espionage and intelligence
operations. The group is infamous for targeting foreign officials and governments. The
sectors targeted by Naikon are indicative of its intentions to infect ASEAN countries. The
group has, furthermore, changed and evolved its TTPs over the years to minimize detection
and maximize profits.
