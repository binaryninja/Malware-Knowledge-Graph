EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Executive summary
Threat Matrix - H1 2019

Emotet malware still dominant

GrandGrab highly visible

Having scaled up its activities during 2018,
Emotet was once again a dominant malware
variant during H1 2019. A large number of
websites were compromised and used to
host malicious documents.

Threat actors quickly updated the ransomware
GrandGrab to V5.2 following the release of a
decryption tool by the No More Ransom Project.
However, developers subsequently announced
the retirement of GrandGrab as they preferred
alternatives to carry out more targeted attacks.

Trickbot & business networks

Bank of Valetta malware attack

North American financial institutions were
targeted by the re-emergence of Trickbot early
in the year. The resumption of Trickbot campaigns
highlighted an increased focus on business
targets specifically victims with broader access
to network resources.

BOV was the victim of a malware attack that caused
some disruption and losses estimated at EUR13M.
Affected accounts were from the US, Czech
Republic and Hong Kong. The group involved also
conducted a series of attacks against Scandinavian
targets but no losses were reported.

Magecart form-jacking variants

New Lazarus APT campaign

New research uncovered as many as 38 different
JS-sniffer variants, up from the 12 previously
identified. An estimated 1.5M victims had visited
infected webstores as JS-sniffers entered the
Crime-as-a-Service market.

The North Korean APT group, Lazarus, was detected
in a new spear phishing campaign. Information
relating to victims’ current job position was
requested in a spoofed head-hunting/recruitment
process, while systems were simultaneously
infected in the background.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Ramnit – global banking trojan

New mobile malware surfaced

The US was at the top of the list of 10 most
infected countries with Italy and Japan second
and third with about half the US infection rate
each. Other countries in the top 10 such as
the UK, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands
had significantly lower rates of infection.

Implemented in Java, TomcatBanker was a new
Android banking trojan that appeared in 2019.
CSIS believed it was written by a fairly skilled
developer to attack popular social apps,
cryptocurrency apps, and over 100 other
popular apps.

Monetization of cybercrime

Smishing on the rise

Cybercriminals worked hard during H1 2019
to drive up revenues using sophisticated
package mule online infrastructure including
state-of-the-art HR and tracking systems.

Smishing, the mobile version of phishing, was
on the rise during H1 2019 largely due to the fact
that we all carry cell phones and the SMS protocol
does not have a spam filter, making it a prime
target for attack.

E-commerce sites targeted

UK targeted by PayPal phish

Online shopping sites were specifically targeted
by cybercriminals who exploited compromised
credentials in elaborate schemes to complete
the checkout process. “Package mules” were
recruited to send on stolen goods to specific
addresses.

A PayPal phish, aimed primarily at victims in
the UK, showed middle-aged individuals in the
45-59 age range to be the most frequent victims.
A two-step process mimicked a PayPal login page
and the second step tricked victims into giving
up personal information.

CSIS THREAT MATRIX - H1 2019

FOREWORD

E-commerce sites are increasingly
targeted by cybercriminals
who are reaching new levels of
sophistication and monetization
by working together.
October 2019
2019 got off to a brisk start with online
fraud prevention presenting a whole series
of new challenges to companies in the
business of keeping your critical data safe.

The simple act of opening an unsafe document
or clicking on a malicious link was a present
danger with most of cyberattacks still relying
on social engineering.

It was notable that major online vendors such
as Amazon and eBay increasingly drew the
attention of fraudsters who used compromised
credentials in elaborate scams to complete the
cash out process. Schemes involving “package
mule networks” showed a whole new level of
sophistication as they involved a complete
HR-type hiring process to select the best
candidates to forward on stolen goods.

Although CSIS always advises against negotiating
with cybercriminals, the consequences of
a ransomware attack on an organization could
be devastating, even to the extent of driving
the victim company out of business. Where
companies feel they have no option but to
negotiate with perpetrators, we always stand
by to offer our assistance to make sure our
customers get back up and running as quickly
as possible without opening themselves up
to even more serious dangers.

Additionally, attacks on the supply chain were
up with a significant increase on previous numbers.
All of this indicates that threat actors are casting
their nets far and wide to target unsuspecting
or vulnerable organizations.
Financial institutions remained prone to attacks
from bad actors, particularly targeting smartphones,
as mobile financial attacks showed a marked
upswing in H1 2019. Overall, mobile devices were
becoming a preferred attack vector for bad actors
due to the prevalence of cell phones and the
lack of a spam filter for the SMS protocol.
It was yet again apparent that the best line of
defence against attack was to have well-trained
and knowledgeable staff who were acutely
aware of the dangers of cybercrime.

I hope you enjoy our latest report and it gives
you some valuable insights into the current
state of cybersecurity and the nature of today’s
increasingly sophisticated online security threats.
As always, thank you for supporting CSIS
as we continue to partner with you to battle
cybercrime wherever and whenever it
becomes a threat.

REAL WORLD SCENARIOS

Extortion and customer service
A targeted ransomware attack by sophisticated threat actors

Problem:
The CEO of a medium-sized hosting
company: “We have always been thinking
cybersecurity by design. However, sometimes
we needed flexibility on an adhoc basis
by opening up for certain internet services
from time-to-time. We could never have
imagined the consequences of doing so.
As seen only in the movies, every physical
server in our data centre started to reboot
one Friday afternoon. Once back online,
none of our customers’ virtual machines
that were running on top of the physical
servers were able to boot. We looked
into the virtual disk images and that’s
when we realised, we had been hacked.”

Investigation:
CSIS was contacted that same Friday
around 16:00 and it quickly became clear
that immediate action needed to be taken
by the CSIS IR team. After the initial analysis,
it was obvious that this was not just some
random ransomware campaign conducted
by simple cybercriminals. We concluded
this was indeed carried out by professionals
based on the following initial findings:

• The timing of the attack
(Friday afternoon).
• The ransomware notes on each
physical machine with references
to at least 6 different encryption keys
being used, and a reference to
a support forum for assistance.
• The execution of the attack
using domain privileges.

8

This was not just some
random ransomware
campaign conducted by
simple cybercriminals.
The CSIS IR team decided to run
three different tracks in parallel:
Track 01:
Reverse engineering
the malware
After spending several hours reverse engineering
the malware, it became clear that there was
nothing to be done within a reasonable timeframe
to help decrypting the infected virtual images
files without knowing the private encryption key.
Another observation was that the malware would
not encrypt any files if the language settings
of the operating system were set to Russian.

As seen only in the movies,
every physical server in our
data centre started to reboot
one Friday afternoon.

REAL WORLD SCENARIOS

Track 02:

Track 03:

Finding Patient-0 and any
potential backdoors

Working on a plan to get
back online ASAP

As all the virtual machine image files were
encrypted, it was only possible to analyse each
of the physical servers and logs from the firewalls.
The analysis revealed that an RDP service on one
of the physical servers had been enabled and
allowed access from the Internet two months
prior to the attack for just seven hours in total.
This in itself was not uncommon, but the logs
also revealed that two individual connections
from two different countries had happened
within the same hour.

The first part of this track was to ensure that
backups were intact and could be used to restore
the virtual servers. Unfortunately, the backup
servers were also running as virtual machines
and had, therefore, also been encrypted.

The analysis revealed
that it was an RDP
brute force attack and,
unfortunately, the password
of the domain administrator
had been easy to guess.

The ransomware notes
were priced at $25,000
for each decryption tool.
As the conclusion of the results from Track 1
became clear, there was only one option left,
if the company wanted to get back online:
“get the private encryption keys from the
cybercriminals”, which in the ransomware notes
were priced at $25,000 for each decryption tool.
The threat actors had been using six different
encryption keys but not all of them were related
to business-critical equipment. In fact, just two
of them would bring 99% of all the systems
back online.

One of those connections was legitimate and
the other one related to the cybercriminals.
Furthermore, the analysis revealed that it was
an RDP brute force attack and, unfortunately,
the password of the domain administrator
had been easy to guess.
The analysis showed no signs of backdoors
on the physical machines but, as all the
virtual disk images were encrypted, it was
not possible to know if any of those had
backdoors installed.

CSIS always strongly advises against

“The alternative could be bankruptcy”.
In short, the company succeeded in buying
the decryption tools from the cybercriminals
without any assistance from CSIS. However,
CSIS assisted afterwards in analysing the
decryption tools for backdoors before being
used. The decryption tools were “clean”
and worked as expected.

However, once the CEO made the point
that they were not to be trusted and did not
keep their word, the criminals backed off.
Their business model appeared to be based
on victims paying the ransom and having the
confidence that they would be able to recover
their data. If it became known that the criminals
would not decrypt the data nobody would
pay the ransom, so no income.
(see screenshots on previous page).

Lessons learned:
• Cybercriminals did care about
their reputation to some extent.
• Cybercriminals deliberately
avoided fouling their own nest
(avoided RU language targets).
• Cybercriminals would not play
by the book but tried all kinds
of tricks to put pressure on
the victim to increase profit.
• Strong password policy is a must.

• Making internal services directly
available from the Internet,
even temporarily, was a big risk
and should be avoided or limited
and monitored accordingly.
• Paying ransom would help fund
and encourage further attacks
even if data is recovered.
• Contracting an IR provider
that can work 24/7 was a must.

TRENDS

CSIS THREAT MATRIX - H1 2019

Banking malware
Threat actors expanded the Crime-as-a-Service business model

The highly active Emotet botnet was a dominant
malware threat in H1 2019. It had already scaled up
its activities during 2018 and continuously flooded
inboxes with daily spam campaigns.
The distribution network was comprised
of two major botnets known as “Epoch1”
and “Epoch2”. The approach consisted
of compromising a large number of
websites which were used to host malicious
documents. Subsequently, a direct link
to the files were added to the spam
emails. If the recipient clicked the link,
the document with the payload
downloaded to the victim’s machine.

The dangers of Emotet infection
The dangers of an Emotet infection were
many. Because of the modular nature of the
malware, it was very effective in helping threat
actors fingerprint the victim. After establishing
persistence by creating scheduled tasks, the
malware was capable of stealing login credentials
from all major browsers and email clients.
Additionally, an Outlook scraper tool was used
to obtain contact information from the victim’s
Outlook account. This could be used to spam
malicious emails to trusted contacts.

A network spreading attack
Emotet also deployed a network spreading
attack from the infected machine by use
of both stolen credentials and predefined
brute force lists.

The dangers of an Emotet
infection were many.

nature of the malware, it
was very effective in helping
threat actors fingerprint
the victim.
Once the infection was complete, Emotet would
push additional payloads which consisted of
both banking trojans (in particular Trickbot)
and ransomware such as Ryuk. Surprisingly,
the entire Emotet infrastructure went completely
silent in the first week of June – although
some dark forum chatter suggested that
a resurgence was planned for H2.

Trickbot campaigns
Trickbot campaigns resumed early in the year
to pre-2019 levels with a focus on North American
financial institutions such as TD Bank, Scotia Bank,
Deloitte Canada and RBC. The malware itself
had a slight update to the password stealing
module (pwgrab).

A wider range of exploitation

Hosted on Google Docs sites

Trickbot now looked specifically for credentials
on the infected machine related to the remote
access services VNC, PuTTY, and RDP. This
highlighted the increased focus on business
targets and in particular victims with broader
access to network resources.

Alongside Trickbot, Gozi/Ursnif v3 was often
actively distributed. One campaign attempted
to lure the victims by suggesting that they
had been subpoenaed to appear in court.
The downloaded malicious documents were
hosted on Google Docs sites which was
a clever way to get around security solutions.

Clearly, Trickbot threat actors were looking
for a wider range of exploitation opportunities
than just compromising a particular bank account.
This was further supported by the deployment
of the hacking tool Mimikatz. Other active
campaigns included Danabot which targeted
Italian, Polish and Australian users, various
Gozi v2 (Dreambot) variants in the US, Germany
and Japan and QakBot distributed by the
Emotet botnet mainly in the US.

Just like Emotet and Trickbot, QakBot would
attempt to spread across network-shared
drives by stealing or brute-forcing credentials
Finally, Ramnit played a significant role actively
claiming victims particularly in the US and Italy.

PrismWeb’s payment form

An estimated 1.5 million people had visited
infected web store sites. JS-sniffers were also
found to have entered the Crime-as-a-Service
market being sold or rented out for anywhere
between $250 and $5,000. In May, TrendMicro
reported an extensive campaign which affected
201 campus online stores in the US and Canada.
The incident contained a supply chain element
since the threat actors compromised a shared
e-commerce platform known as PrismWeb.

The targeted nature of the attack - the malicious
script collected data only from HTML elements
with the specific IDs on PrismWeb’s payment
form - was an unusual component that
prompted TrendMicro to give this group
a separate name “Mirrorthief”.

Ransomware again made headlines in major incidents

GrandGrab remained one of the most visible threats
in ransomware campaigns. Although a decryption
tool was released by the No More Ransom Project
for version 5.1, threat actors quickly updated
the malware to version 5.2.
However, later in the year GandGrab
developers announced retirement
of the malware and instead other
variants such as Ryuk, MegaCortex
and LockerGoga gained traction
by deploying more targeted
strategies.

Losses in excess of NOK 300M
One major incident involved Norwegian
aluminium manufacturer Norsk Hydro
which was severely impacted by
LockerGoga. Several other industrial
and manufacturing companies had
been targeted by the same malware.
An estimate from Norsk Hydro pointed
to losses in excess of NOK 300M (£26M).

$1.1m in ransom to regain access
Public entities also experienced severe
problems with ransomware, especially
in the US where counties Riviera Beach
and Lake City in Florida were compelled
to pay a total of $1.1m in ransom to
regain access to critical systems.

This pattern has been well documented
since the public release of the infamous
ZeuS/Zbot source code and several
similar incidents.

Finally, the North Korean APT group known
as Lazarus was detected in a new spear
phishing campaign with an attachment
named "Euronet_Application.rar".
When opened, a pop-up would request
information related to the victim’s current
job position which could have seemed
consistent with a head-hunting/recruitment
process. However, in the background,
a digitally signed dropper would be installed
on the system allowing access for the
threat actors.

Biometric patterns defeated

CSIS had been monitoring the latest
version 2.0 of the banking trojan Ramnit
since around mid-2018. A few noteworthy
changes were detected when compared
to the original version:

Originally, Ramnit 2.0 even had a built-in
feature which suspended all threads related
to RapportGP.dll in order to circumvent
IBM Trusteer Rapport. However, in the latest
samples analysed, that feature was removed.
Another module was deployed to defeat

vendor BioCatch, making Ramnit one
of the more sophisticated threats of 2019.

• Protocol “hello” request
changed from 0x00ff to 0x895e.
• Used a plugin called “Camellia”.
• Had injects in LUA format.
• Created task in TaskSheduler

• Supported both 32-bit and
64-bit platforms”.

At the time of writing, CSIS observed three
different botnets - with 40, 100 and 600

The monetisation of compromised data
Recruitment and management of a package mule network

The profit-driven cybercrime business reached a new
level of sophistication during 2019. An increasing number
of specialised threat actors worked together to drive
up revenue. Yet, having a state-of the-art malware
setup such as Ramnit would not be enough by itself.
At the end of the day, the money generated needed
to be laundered into the legitimate economy.
An elaborate setup
The advantage of attacking online bank
accounts remained that you needed relatively
few steps to accomplish this and it could
be kept out of the physical world. However,
another large part of cybercrime revolved
around exploiting compromised credentials
for e-commerce sites such as Amazon and
eBay. In these cases, an elaborate setup

This type of specialised network supported

could steal Amazon credentials, order goods
from the account and then send them to
a pool of package mules in the relevant
countries.

The cash-out service managed everything
from the package transport to the reselling

were easy to resell and the botmasters

on scalable cash-out operations like this one
to continue to increase their revenue.

undermines law enforcement investigations;
behind one carder you would find different

MOBILE MALWARE

TomcatBanker
A new Android banking trojan coded in Java

A completely new Android banking trojan surfaced
early this year and CSIS have been trying to map
out any information about its infection campaigns.
The malware was implemented in Java and its
samples could be found in large volumes on
the popular threat hunting platforms.
Used overlays to attack
Reverse engineering the trojan's binaries led to
the belief that it was written by a fairly skilled
developer. TomcatBanker primarily used overlays
to attack popular social apps, cryptocurrency
apps, as well as over a hundred financial apps from
the following countries: Austria, Australia, France,
Germany, Italy, Turkey, The United Kingdom
and The United States.

Reverse engineering the
trojan's binaries led to the
belief that it was written by
a fairly skilled developer.

Riltok aka Realtalk
Yet another overlay-based banking trojan
In January of 2019, CSIS noticed an odd
campaign of a certain banking malware
for the Android OS. Riltok (aka Realtalk)
turned out to be an overlay-based banking
trojan and a lot of its code was implemented
in a native library instead of Java.

Clearly targeting France
The incidence we observed was clearly targeting
France with its fake Leboncoin website campaign
which delivered the malware to a victim’s
smartphone via a phishing attack.

Russian bank customers
However, during our analysis, only configuration
for the attacks against customers of Russian
banks came up. The original Leboncoin website
is a French portal for selling used and secondhand goods. A year ago, we saw Realtalk attack
Android devices in the UK. It was running an
almost identical campaign as infections came
through a fake Gumtree website which
is a similar UK website to Leboncoin.

MOBILE MALWARE

Gustuff
Mobile malware as-a-service
Gustuff is a variant of AndyBot. The victim’s
banking account was compromised by
displaying HTML based overlays, which
had simple credential-phishing
functionality with two steps (for AU,
USA and the EU countries).

Only ten slots for renting
The seller of the malware opened only
ten slots for renting the Gustuff kit
priced at $800/month. CSIS did not
detect any activity of the botnet
from May 2019.

Anubis
Well-known malware variant still going strong

H1 2019 was eventful for Anubis – one of the most
common Android banking Trojans since 2017. 2018 ended
with the release of version 2.5 which brought plenty of
feature updates, such as an ability to associate the Anubis
infection with the same victim’s Windows PC infection.
This became possible when a victim
of a Windows PC infection connected
their uninfected Android device to
their PC via USB.

Anubis source code leaked
In March 2019, the author of Anubis
(aka Maza-In) was arrested in The Russian
Federation. Two men were accused of the
development, the operation and the sale
of the Trojan. The following month, someone
leaked the source code of the Anubis
malware and its infrastructure. Naturally,
this leak increased the interest of the blackhat
community in this Trojan. Soon developers
started working on variants of Anubis.

30

Android Accessibility Services
The most notable variant development
that came to the attention of CSIS on
the underground forums, was about adding
a capability of abusing the Accessibility
Services of the Android OS in order to
manipulate financial apps and transfer
(steal) funds automatically. Besides Anubis,
there was another code leak this year that
is worth mentioning. A banking trojan
called Asacub was leaked to the public
in May 2019. CSIS had not yet confirmed
any variants in the wild.

Ursnif is the dominant malware

Regular phishing attacks

A significant change from our previous
Threat Matrix Report was we found Ursnif
to have replaced Trickbot by a substantial
margin as the dominant malware variant
detected. Ursnif, a.k.a. Gozi v.3x, was
used by threat actors in the UK, US and CA.
In June, the sudden disappearance of both
Trickbot and Emotet campaigns further
influenced the statistics.

Regular phishing attacks moved up as the
number one infection vector pushing network
spreading to second place. This underlined
the continuous need for awareness campaigns
by all organisations, not just as a measure
against banking attacks but, to an increasing
degree, also against targeted ransomware
attacks and the ever-present threat of business
email compromise fraud (BEC fraud).

News from the phish pond
PayPal under fire by a sustained phishing campaign

Smishing, the mobile version
of phishing, was on the rise in H1 2019.
A good reason for this was that we
carry our smartphone with us all
the time and the SMS protocol
offers no spam filter.
That made the mobile platform an excellent
and vulnerable target. A recent campaign showed
how persistent a smishing threat can be.

PayPal, Amazon and eBay

In this case we came across an active
PayPal scam page that, according
to the publicly available log files,
had been active for more than 75 days
and counting at the time of writing.
A very effective scam
The statistics spoke for themselves,
and, with a daily average of over
a thousand visits, we can certainly
conclude that the scam was very effective.
Once we started digging into it, we found
that the server was also used for scams
other than just the PayPal phish.
Besides three PayPal sites side-by-side,
the server also hosted an Amazon
and an eBay phish.

With a daily average
