ESET researchers have discovered a malicious campaign distributing a backdoor via
torrents, with Korean TV content used as a lure

1/18

Fans of Korean TV should be on the lookout for an ongoing campaign spreading malware
via torrent sites, using South Korean movies and TV shows as a guise. The malware allows
the attacker to connect the compromised computer to a botnet and control it remotely.
The malware is a modified version of a publicly available backdoor named GoBot2. The
modifications to the source code are mainly South Korea-specific evasion techniques,
which are described in detail in this blogpost. Due to the campaign’s clear focus on South
Korea, we have dubbed this Win64/GoBot2 variant GoBotKR.
According to ESET telemetry, GoBotKR has been active since March 2018. The detections
are in the hundreds, with South Korea being the most affected (80%), followed by China
(10%) and Taiwan (5%).

Distribution
GoBotKR has been spreading via South Korean and Chinese torrent sites, masquerading
as Korean movies and TV shows, as well as some games.
The attackers behind this campaign try to trick users into executing the malware by boobytrapping the contents of the torrents with malicious files that have deceptive filenames,
extensions and icons. Our analysis shows that the torrents using a movie/TV show disguise
generally contain the following types of files:
1. The expected MP4 file
2. A malicious executable masked as a PMA archive file with a filename mimicking
various codec installers
3. A malicious LNK file with a filename and icon mimicking the expected video file
Figure 1 shows examples of torrent contents from this malicious campaign.

second screenshot); the malware is executed by an LNK file with a deceptive filename and icon

So how exactly do users get compromised?
Directly opening the intended MP4 file will not result in any malicious action. The catch here
is that the MP4 file is often hidden in a different directory, and users might encounter the
malicious LNK file mimicking it first. Further increasing the chance of users falling for the
lure is the fact that the extension of the LNK file is normally not displayed when viewed in
Windows Explorer, as seen in the second screenshot in Figure 1, in the file with the Korean
name.
Clicking on the deceptive LNK file executes the malware. However, it also opens the
intended file (in this case a video), giving victims little reason to suspect something has
gone wrong.
Renaming the malicious EXE file to a PMA file is also likely done to prevent raising
suspicion of potential victims. We have also seen this technique using games as a lure, and
with filenames and extensions relevant to gaming.
During our investigation, we have seen the following filenames being used for the malicious
executables: starcodec.pma, WedCodec.pma and Codec.pma (movie/TV show disguise)
and leak.dll (game disguise). The name “starcodec” mimics the legitimate Korean codec
pack Starcodec.

Capabilities
GoBotKR was built on the basis of a backdoor named GoBot2, the source code of which
has been publicly available since March 2017. Both the original and the modified version
are written in GoLang, also known as Go. While still relatively rare for malware, new
variants of GoLang malware are emerging, likely due to the challenges posed to analysts
with the bulky nature of its compiled executables.
The functionality of GoBotKR largely overlaps with the published GoBot2 source code, with
only minimal modifications. Overall, the malware is not particularly complex technically, and
the implementation is rather straightforward. Most features are implemented with the use of
GoLang libraries, and by executing Windows commands (such as cmd, ipconfig, netsh,
shutdown, start, systeminfo, taskkill, ver, whoami, and wmic), and third-party utilities such
as BitTorrent and uTorrent clients.

Collected information
Ultimately, the actors behind GoBotKR are building a network of bots that can then be used
to perform DDoS attacks of various kinds (e.g. SYN Flood, UDP Flood, or Slowloris).
Therefore, after being executed, GoBotKR first collects system information about the
compromised computer, including network configuration, OS version information, CPU and
GPU versions. In particular, it collects a list of installed antivirus software.
This information is sent to a C&C server, which helps the attackers determine which bots
should be used in the respective attacks. All C&C servers that we extracted from the
analyzed malware samples are hosted in South Korea and registered by the same person.

Bot commands
Once communication with the C&C server is established, the server instructs the
compromised computer with backdoor commands. GoBotKR supports fairly standard botnet
functions, which mostly serve three main purposes:
allowing misuse of the compromised computer
allowing the botnet operators to control, or further extend, the botnet
evading detection or hiding from the user
These are the supported commands:
carry out a DDoS attack on a specified victim
access a URL
execute a file, a command, a script
update, terminate or uninstall itself
shutdown/reboot/log off the computer

4/18

change homepage in IE
change desktop background
seed torrents
copy itself to connected removable media, and setup AutoRun function
copy itself to public folders of cloud storage services (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google
Drive)
run a reverse proxy server
run an HTTP server
change firewall settings, edit hosts file, open a port
enable/disable Task Manager
enable/disable Windows registry editors
enable/disable Command Prompt
kill a process
hide a process window
Of particular interest are two commands – seeding torrents and DDoS capability.
The “seed torrents” command allows the attackers to misuse the victimized machines for
seeding arbitrary files using the BitTorrent and uTorrent programs, even if these are not
already installed on the system. This may be used as a mechanism to distribute the
malware further.
The “carry out a DDoS attack” command lets attackers abuse the victim’s network
bandwidth to block the availability of targeted services, such as websites. According to our
analysis, this is most likely the main purpose of the GoBotKR botnet.

Evasion techniques
In this section, we explore the evasion techniques used by the GoBotKR backdoor. While
many techniques were already present in the publicly available source code, the authors of
GoBotKR further expanded them with South Korea-specific features. This shows us that the
attackers customized the malware for a specific audience, while taking extra effort to remain
undetected in their campaign.

Techniques taken from GoBot2
The following detection evasion and anti-analysis techniques used by GoBotKR have been
adopted from GoBot2 source code:
The malware installs two instances of itself on the system. The second instance
(watchdog) monitors whether the first instance is still active and reinstalls it if it has
been removed from the system.

5/18

The malware employs antivirus bypass techniques (it allocates large chunks of
memory and delays execution of the malicious payload to prevent antivirus engines
from emulating the code due to resource constraints).
The malware can detect selected security and analytical tools, such as debuggers. If
detected, it terminates itself.
The malware terminates itself if IP information of the victim suggests one of several
blacklisted organizations (e.g. Amazon, BitDefender, Cisco, ESET). It uses external
legitimate websites for querying IP information and searches for hardcoded strings in
this information (e.g. “cloud”, “Cisco”, “Microsoft”), rather than using API functions.
The malware terminates itself if its file name consists of 32 hexadecimal characters,
which prevents the payload from being executed in some automated sandboxes.

South Korea-specific modifications in GoBotKR
The authors of GoBotKR added three new evasion techniques, related to their focus on
South Korea:
As explained in the previous section, the malware uses IP information of the
compromised computer to detect whether it is running in one of the blacklisted
organizations. In GoBot2, the IP address of the victim is determined by accessing
Amazon Web Services or dnsDynamic and parsing the reply.
In the samples of GoBotKR we analyzed, these URLs are replaced with South Korean
online platforms Naver and Daum.
GoBotKR features a new evasion technique that scans running processes on the
compromised system to detect selected antivirus products (listed in Table 1). If any of
the products are detected, the malware terminates itself and removes some traces of
its activity from the host. The list of detected processes includes products by AhnLab,
a South Korean security company.

Table 1. List of security products detected by GoBotKR
The malware tries to detect analytical tools running on the system. It terminates itself
if any of them are detected. The list is internally named “ahnNames”, which might be
another reference to AhnLab.

Figure 2. The malware’s blacklist of running processes is internally named “ahnNames”

In addition to the AhnLab references, the defensive techniques described in the second and
third points were added into the source code as a file named AhnLab.go, according to the
metadata we obtained from the malware.

Timeline
Because the malware is spreading via torrents, a lot of the samples are broken or
incomplete. We were, however, able to recover C&C servers and internal version
information.
Since the malware was first seen, we have detected samples with internal versions 2.0, 2.3,
2.4, and 2.5. Each of these versions comes with some minor technical improvements or
differences in implementation. The versioning differs from that used in the GoBot2 source
code, where an internal name “ArchDuke” is used.

Table 2. GoBotKR version timeline
As seen in the table, the first malware samples detected in May 2018 were not yet
customized for South Korean targets and were thus almost identical to the GoBot2 source
code. However, we were able to link them to newer samples because they used the same
C&C server.
