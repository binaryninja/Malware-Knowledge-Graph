Overview of Targets, Plans, and Attack Vectors
Israeli companies mentioned in the documents
•

Israir

•

Teletus

•

Various Israeli hotels

•

Most of the Israeli insurance companies

Outline of the preliminary data gathering operation and attacks on Ethiopian Airlines and Malaysia Airlines
1. Preparation sessions – learning about Iranian airlines operating from Iranian airports. This included learning
about Operational Technologies (OT) used by the airlines and airports.
2. Identifying the Database (DB) admins for the targeted airlines.
3. Identifying the admins of various systems exposed to the internet.
4. Breaching the targeted airlines network and attempting to compromise additional systems.
5. Once within the network, obtaining admins' passwords.
6. Identifying the DC.
7. Exfiltrating the DC's logs.
8. Exfiltrating the Events Security logs.
9. Identifying various systems' IP addresses.
10. Breaching critical servers via brute force techniques.
11. Assessing if and how it is possible to breach the DB by analyzing the files (note – it is unclear what files the
document is referring to).
12. Accessing the DB.
A specific clause to Malaysian Airlines – receiving the dump
13. Exfiltrating the data.
14. Compromising or creating Web servers to receive the data.
15. Collaborating with other teams in order to analyze the data.

Attack on AirAsia
First stage – breaching their network.
1. Obtaining the company's IP addresses.
2. Conducting penetration tests on their network.
3. Gathering a list of the all of the company's website as well as any other website linked to the company, and
then conducting on them penetration tests.
4. Breaching any vulnerable asset.
Second stage – obtaining sensitive data.

1. Obtaining usernames and passwords of employees.
2. Levering compromised employee accounts to evaluate the systems admins.
Attack on Philippine Airlines
1. Using a VPN to access the company's internal network.
2. Obtaining usernames and passwords for the company's work stations, servers, and email accounts.
3. Evaluating the system admins and assets to determine whether it is possible and how to execute the attack.
4. Leveraging the compromised data from the breached systems and DBs.
Problems the attackers encountered
1. Robust anti-virus installed on critical systems.
2. Strong firewalls that prevented access to various ports.
3. The use of a local Microsoft Office365 email server. As a result, even after the attackers obtained usernames
and passwords they were unable to remotely login to them.
4. Network segmentation – the internal network was not connected to the external network.
Attack on Thai Airways
1. The attackers used a compromised email of a Fly Dubai employee to send phishing emails to other
employees. The email contained an attachment of a malicious Excel file with various flight lists.
2. This file was created by penetration team (likely Muddy Water). Out of the 40 recipiences 5 individuals
opened the email and infected their computers.
3. After they obtained these employees' usernames and passwords the attackers accessed two databases. The
first was an Oracle DB, while the other was an IBM DB2 database.

Attack on the Azerbaijani Department of Health
1. Locating vulnerable websites hosted on the governmental network.
2. Searching on Google for absolute address within the vulnerable websites.
3. Attempting to execute SQL injections on these sites. This appear to have been unsuccessful.
4. Creating shells on the databases.
5. Using a shell to send remote commands to compromised computers. This method was conducted via
Desktop Protocol (RDP).
Attack on the website – roshan.af
First stage – attempting to breach the network via a social engineering attack. This attack was unsuccessful as the
nobody opened the malicious file. Concurrently, breaching the Linux system used by the website and injecting a
shell. Note however that the Linux system had limited capabilities (it is unclear what the attackers meant by this).
After considerable efforts the attackers eventually were able to install a hydra system. Afterwards the attackers
executed a successful brute force attack on the SMB systems.
The attackers detail the most valuable type of data they were trying to obtain from the DB:
1. Email addresses of directors and other key individuals in the organization.
2. Types and version of the system used by the organization.
3. Network layouts.

4. List of open ports.
5. List of active internal ports used by employees for purchases.
6. List of port used for communication. It is unclear what the attackers mean by this. Possibly ports used by
various chat programs.
Attack on Etihad Airways
The attack on the UAE airline was executed via RDP – CITRIX account. Once in the attackers gathered intelligence,
notably usernames and passwords.

A strategic document regarding the creation of Rana
First stage – the need for Rana
According to the document the leader of Iran it is vital to develop and expand the country's intelligence gathering
and cyber capabilities (developing malware and viruses, various systems, etc.). Accordingly, they created a
specialized cyber espionage unite that also had the objective of protected the regime if need be.

Second stage – Rana's objectives
•

Propagating the Islamic culture and its ideas.

•

Obtaining and providing the leader with strategic intelligence.

•

Develop technological knowledge and capabilities.

•

Conducting a cyber and intelligence warfare with the rest of the world.

•

Utilizing Iranian experts, particularity members of universities in Tehran, as consultants on matters of infosecurity.

•

Using these new skills and capabilities to promote and achieve the government's objective.

•

Obtaining intelligence of value to various governmental departments and industrial sectors (note that the
Department of Defense oversees the Iranian industrial-defense complex rather than the military).

•

These objectives are then followed by more specific goals related to the Iranian population, including
expanding the intelligence gathering operation within the country by hacking Iranian universities, mobile
companies, airports, etc. (note – it is unclear however the document possibly also refers to Iranian
individuals who have contacts to people outside of the country).

Rana sub-group – trojan and malware teams
The objective of this sub-group is hacking, developing malware and attack tools, establishing and maintaining
foothold on compromised networks, etc. One other objective is using malwares to identify anyone who poses a
threat to the regime such as riot leaders.
The members of the group are experts in IT, encryptions algorithms, firmware, malware and virus development.
Further, they are fluent in various foreign languages.
The group can be categorized to several teams:
•

Linux.

•

Viruses (likely Microsoft based however this is unclear).

•

MAC OS.

•

Mobile.

Iranian Nation-State APT Groups - Confidential Documents Leak
Analysis of Targets, Plans, and Attack Vectors
Summary of the Event
Over the last few weeks, several significant leaks regarding a number of Iranian APTs took place. After analyzing and
investigating the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to
the groups and their operation.
The identity of the actor behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the
exposed documents and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak will likely
hamstring the groups' operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our assessment this will minimize the risk of
potential attacks in the next few months and possibly even year.
Note - most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose.
Below are the three main Telegram groups on which the leaks were posted:
Lab Dookhtegam pseudonym ("The people whose lips are stitched and sealed" – translation from Persian) – In this
channel attack tools attributed to the group 'OilRig' were leaked; including a webshell that was inserted into the
Technion, various tools that were used for DNS attacks, and more.
Green Leakers – In this channel attack tools attributed to the group 'MuddyWatter' were leaked. The group's name
and its symbol are identified with the "green movement", which led the protests in Iran after the Presidential
elections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary guards (IRGC)
Black Box – Unlike the previous two channels this has been around for a long time. On Friday May 5th, dozens of
confidential documents labeled as "secret" (a high confidentiality level in Iran, one before the highest - top secret)
were posted on this channel. The documents were related to Iranian attack groups' activity.
The documents leaked on Friday include:
Documents by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (comparable to the FBI and CIA) with information about a group
known as "Rana". At this stage, we cannot attribute the group to other known Iranian actors.
The documents shed light on some aspects of the group's activity, notably:
-

Tracking Iranians
Tracking Iranians citizens outside of Iran
The group's members

These documents contain lists of victims, cyber-attack strategies, alleged areas of access, a list of employees, and
screenshots from internal websites relevant to espionage systems.
Further, a one of the document appears to be from the center for IT security incidents Kavesh". Note however that
the it was adapted from the original document by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and now also contains
their symbol. This document was partly leaked and contained details regarding a development program of a
malware for attacking SCADA systems (similar Stuxnet).
In this item we review the documents relevant to Israel and to attack capabilities. We translated the documents
independently and did not use Google. Note that there are some ambiguous sentences.

Documents from the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence
Rana team
In this leak there are numerous confidential documents with a level of "secret", which detail Rana's goals. They
appear to have been written by a hacking and penetration team within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence's cyber
operations department.

Infrastructure used by the team

We are continuing to examine these servers and will update on our findings.

Proof that VMware is used to enter and trade with cryptocurrency wallets
Amongst the documents there was also an image which, according to the leakers, proves an attempt to conceal
currency procurement (perhaps due to the sanctions on Iran). This was done using a virtual environment – VMware
server.

End of year Report 2015 (1394 according to Persian calendar).
The first pages from the 1394 end of year report (March 2015
– March 2016) were leaked. They contain a strategic plan to
hack airline companies and collect information about them.
Based on this report we believe that hacking attempts on airline
companies were carried out. The writers of the document
stated that some important people in the country use
international airlines, and therefore the following information
should be gathered:
1. Information about flights.
a. Flights routes that could be under foreign
surveillance.
b. Comprehensive information on identification
scenarios of passengers and identifying important
people on the plane.
c. Certain individuals that could board a flight in
disguise (for example, a scenario where with
Iranians citizens departs from Iran, and then fly to
Israel via another country such as Dubai).
d. Information on suspicious people that boarded specific flights, for example "the man" who was on the
flight from Tehran to Moscow on January 1st, 2014, and flew on April 7th, 2016 from London to Tel Aviv.
2. Information about passengers in specific airlines (the airlines were not mentioned). Specifically - first
name, last name, passport number, visa number, ethnicity, communication details, how the tickets were
sold and bought.
3. Information about the flight crew. For example, number of pilots on a flight from Dubai to London.
4. Information about airline employees, with an emphasis on executives, managers, network admins, airport
managers, and booking operators.
5. Information about the airlines' finacial status.
6. Information on equipment used by the company. This includes planes (e.g. number and type of planes,
their condition, when they were used last, etc.) as well as computer equipment (number and type of
servers and computers, etc.)
Note - at the end of the page it is stated that in the next pages there will be a specific list of targets, but
this page is missing from this leak.

Report on the first half of 1395
In another report on regarding 1395 (specifically March 2016 – August 2016), several tracking projects are
detailed. A documentation regarding attacks that were carried out on airlines' databases, including the Israeli
airline 'Israir'. Below is a full translation of relevant parts of the document:
•

•
•

The airline's database
o Entering Qatar's database, and queries on flights.
o Entering Israir's database.
o Query on Dubai activity.
o Query on Skyward's activity
The Turkish police database
Cooperation with these targets' attack groups.

Examine Israir's databases.
Examining an insurance company's databases in Saudi Arabia
Examining RTA's databases from the UAE

The next page contains an R&D clause, with details on
measures taken before attacks, preliminary research, and
possible attack vectors. Some of the measures include:
•

A meeting with employees from the international
airport in Tehran to learn about the airport's systems.

•

Research on various databases.

•

Research on using ORACLE and SQL server. In this
regard, the attackers worked with SQL Loader and
Bulk insert in order to quickly enter databases, and
with BCP utility to copy the information from the
servers.

Moreover, the document also mentions gathering
information on flights – mapping of assets that can be used
to check-in, security procedures on the plane, and data
collection via the real-time flight tracking website
FlightRadar24.

Attacks on Israel
Attacks on insurance companies – A document with the title "Hacking Israel's insurance companies". It contains a
list of Israeli insurance companies (see image below). Note that the title in Persian does not enable us to discern if
it is an attack that already took place, or a list of future targets.

Attacks on hotel booking websites in Israel – Below is a screenshot from a document with information about two
hotel booking websites. It lays out the website's main activity, the access obtained, and the intelligence gathered.

According to the document, Israelhotels.org is one of the most important hotel booking websites.
Further, it alleges that they gained full access to the website's database. The documents contain information on 120
thousand of the website's users, including name, password, and around 86 thousand credit cards.

Israeli airlines' databases – Like the strategic documents, this document also mentions an attack against Israir.
The attack includes attempts to gather information from Israir's booking system's database, which mainly include
information about bookings and credit cards. Due to the many error messages in the document, we cannot
determine whether this attack succeeded or failed.

The attack was carried out on MSSQL 2000 servers that the company uses, and with the following user agent:

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727) Havij
Attack on Teletus website and other hotel booking companies – a strategic report on an attack against the Israeli
firm Teletus. Its goal was to obtain access to websites connected to hotel bookings in Israel. According to the report,
the breach was successful. The information was presented in a strategic report from Spring 1393 (April –May 2014),
but the nature of the report is unknown.

An attack on the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture – a table from a document with ambiguous content.

Attacks on non-Israeli targets
In addition to the above documents, there are also dozens of other documents relevant to other countries. For
example, several documents contain information on attacks against government ministries in Kuwait. The goal of
the attack was to obtain access to a Kuwaiti email service, and gather information on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
through it.
A strategic report from the first half of 1396 (March – August 2017) describes activity carried out against Kuwait.
According to this document, two teams worked on the attack: the hacking team, and the social engineering team.
The document was written in first person plural, and was most likely written by the attack team.
Below is an outline of the hacking team's operation
At first, the team carried out various tests, including penetration tests on systems of the Foreign Ministry. Then they
mapped all the IP addresses, the domains, the websites, and the apps used by the ministry. The team carried out
more tests to see what is open and accessible in the network. They found out that they could obtain the highest
level of control of the targeted servers.
After a full examination, they transferred their conclusions to the social engineering team. The hacking team also
obtained access to the ministry's employee database, and sent spam messages to everyone within the ministry in
order to validate the emails using mail tracker.
Below is an outline of the social engineering team
Phishing – Phishing attacks on numerous firms, for example "Atam Alanya" hospital and the Qatari oil company.
Spear-phising– The team communicated directly with people related to the Foreign Ministry.

Concurrently, they worked on R&D: setting up a server and website, preparing the malware
written in Python, and planning the activity together with the technical teams.
Based on another document that details an attack on the Foreign Ministry, it appears that the attack was successful.

IRGC Documents
Another document with the IRGC symbol contains a plan named
project 910. It outlines development of a malware and a C2
(command and control) server.
According to the report, the project intended to damage SCADA
systems. It is a botnet, but in fact behaves like an spy-malware with
identification, espionage and remote connection abilities. As of
09/12/1394 (February 28th, 2016- the date the document was
written), the project was unsuccessful and did not achieve its goals
despite a large budget.
Additionally, we detected another document that extensively
details the attack vector, but lacks the part about the bot in the
leaked document. Further, the document does not have the IRGC
symbol.

In this item we review only the document leaked, based on the assumption that the malware was modified for
project 910.
Attack vector as presented in the document:
The documents in our possession are incomplete. Accordingly, we are unable to provide a full and accurate
assessment of the attack vector. Below are screen captures from the documents showing flow charts of the attack
vector.

Attack vector – flow chart 1

Attack vector – flow chart 2
