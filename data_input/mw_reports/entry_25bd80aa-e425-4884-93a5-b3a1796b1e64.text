In this last part, we will compare Old Qealler with the new Qealler/Pyrogenic variant. The
previous posts Pyrogenic Infostealer static analysis ‚Äì Part 0x1 & Unpacking
Pyrogenic/Qealler using Java agent -Part 0x2 went through the latest Pyrogenic/Qealler [6]
statically and dumping the unpacked code using Java agent.

Note: When this post mention Old Qealler it means that the variant which was using the
Qazagne Python credential harvester.
Similarity between Qealler variants
For easy/fast comparison, I have imported unpacked code of both Qealler variant in Eclipse
IDE. I will compare this Old Qealler (MD5: 8D564A18B902461C19936CCB1F4E2F12) [5]
and new Pyrogenic/Qealler sample (MD5: F0E21C7789CD57EEBF8ECDB9FADAB26B) [6]
used in the previous posts. Highly recommended to read through the existing analysis of Old
Qealler Unloaded[2] by @jeFF0Falltrades & article [3] by Zscaler.
Both Qealler variants use the same Qrypter packer variant.
1. AES Key bbb6fec5ebef0d93

You will find multiple references to bbb6fec5ebef0d93 as shown below. This is the AES key
used in both variant.

2/6

Same AES Key bbb6fec5ebef0d93
2. UUID Key 2a898bc98aaf6c96f2054bb1eadc9848eb77633039e9e9ffd833184ce553fe9b

Config is stored in a key value pair and key for UUID present in both variants. This key is
also present in the Old Qealler Unloaded[2] article and the same string ‚ÄúLoaded:‚Äù is used in
both variants.

Same UUID key
3. Systeminfo in JSON format

It collects the system info in JSON format before encrypting and sending it to CC. Both
Qealler variants use the same key e.g osName, osVersion, osArch, totalMemory and
code structure as shown below. localIpAddress & globalIpAddress keys are added to the
new Qealler version.

3/6

Systeminfo in JSON format Qealler Pyrogenic
4. ShutdownHook

It is used when we want to run some code when JVM is shutting down and both variants use
the addShutdownHook() to delete the files.

4/6

ShutdownHook
5. QeallerV4 string

Found this string ‚Äúobfuscated/META-INF/QeallerV4.kotlin_module‚Äù in memory in the new
Qealler/Pyrogenic sample. Maybe this is version 4 ?
Conclusion
In this Java malware analysis series we started with static analysis, then moved to
Unpacking code using Java agent and in this last part we compared the Qealler variant.
These above similarities are the most significant which I can find based on code analysis. I
can conclude that the Malware author moved the Credential stealing from Python to Java
based code. Malware authors are experienced coder
as they divided the source code in multiple sensible packages and gave proper name to
functions, variables and classes.
