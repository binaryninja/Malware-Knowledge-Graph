The MsnMM Campaigns
The Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns

Introduction
Over time, the Naikon APT appears to have used specific toolsets against organizations within
a designated country, as though each campaign was focused on one country. There is
sometimes crossover between campaigns in several ways: the backdoors they deliver, the
infiltration techniques, and the overall infrastructure. Backdoor functionality can also cross
campaigns and tools. For example, sometimes we see an “inject” variant dropping a “sys10”
backdoor. Or a naikon backdoor dropping a rarstone backdoor. Again, this particular actor is
responsible for the MsnMM and Naikon campaigns deploying the following backdoors and tools:
●

sslMM
winMM
exe_exchange
wininetMM/sakto
inject
sys10
xsControl/naikon and plugins
rarstone
second stage tools

The Naikon group also deployed a lesser-known set of second stage tools. They mixed together
legitimate system administration tools with offensive network reconnaissance tools, including a
custom network and service scanner and an attack codeset based on old Honker Union
codebase shared on Chinese-speaking forums. See “Second Stage Tools”.
For years, Naikon downloaders/backdoors were delivered to victim systems with kit-produced
CVE-2012-0158 spear-phish. This exploit builder kit was shared amongst multiple APTs,
because we see the same exploits dropping tools from various groups. Many of these exploit
attachments were blocked by our advanced exploit protection (AEP) on customer systems in
Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines, and organizations related to the energy sector in these and
other ASEAN nations. Some of these backdoors and spear-phish activities also showed up in
the Hardore Charlie CEIEC dump. In Jan 2014, we observed in some targets the increase of
“right-to-left-override” (RTLO) naming schemes for initial payload delivery. In addition to its
custom toolset, it appears to test freely-distributed tools - in December 2013, it pushed out
“Everything32” to victim systems, and TeamViewer was used as well. It is likely that the group
faced difficulties when it came up against anti-malware products and tried abusing legitimate
tools for anti-malware evasion. Finally, this threat actor deploys a custom pdf binding tool, to
add to its effective but low-tech toolset.

The Naikon attackers can be, and in fact have been precise in social-engineering their targets.
Data collection prior to an attack may have included the following data points:
● full names
● email addresses and status (active or inactive)
● date of birth and age
● interests in current events
● nationality
● gender
● previous email and social network communications to and from a target
● language spoken
Victims of the early campaigns were located mostly throughout Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore,
Laos, Malaysia, and the Philippines. There are other locations where Naikon’s victims can be
found, but these countries stand out.
To get in to target networks, the Naikon APT relied on email as an attack vector. It first
compromised victim systems using common spear-phishing techniques, Such as cve-2012-0158 exploit
attachments, attachments altered with RTLO techniques, and a combination of icon-spoofing and
name padding for executables. The MsnMM campaigns featured ripped images and documents
re-used for spear-phish decoys, and we see that technique reapplied throughout other Naikon
APT campaigns. The winMM components were also delivered to Myanmar victims throughout
mid-2013 using RTLO and icon-spoofing techniques and sometimes even simpler icon
spoofing+double extension+extra spacing in attachment filenames. For example, many of the
Backdoor.Win32.MsnMM.i (winMM) executable filenames maintained almost 200 spaces,
looking like this:
“letter to Gov office.doc
.exe”
The Naikon APT used multiple backdoors presenting a variety of behaviors over time, but
clusters of indicators were fairly consistent into 2015.

Shared Exploit Generation Kit
It’s interesting that what appear to be multiple campaigns and crews all use a kit that generates
CVE-2012-0158 exploits embedded with arbitrary backdoors for spear-phishing. One of the
interesting characteristics of the Naikon APT’s kit-produced shellcode is its runtime function
offset calculations and control flow are built to jump past behavior-based protection and
sandbox analysis. Each of the win32 api shellcode calls are carefully executed to land just past
function hot patch space and prologues, evading user mode trampolines and hooks.
MsnMM, Naikon and Rarstone backdoors were generally delivered with stock 0158 exploits.
Some dropped iph.bat and an “iExplorer.exe” that began with a “WMcal” parameter and
profile.dat executable blob loaded into a running IE process. Other APTs use this kit as well. We
found Stone Panda Poison Ivy samples delivered with the same CVE-2012-0158 exploits,

dropping iph.bat and iExplorer.exe, and running the “iExplorer.exe WMcal” executable filename
and parameter.
Finally, we found another exploit builder’s template used to attack Korean-speaking targets. It
was used across this group and others for building CVE-2012-0158 files, sharing the common
author “Tran Duy Linh”.

Shared Strings, Functionality, Targets, and Infrastructure across Campaigns
Multiple Naikon tools used in multiple campaigns shared strings, functionality, a deployment and
content focus on ASEAN organizations and other organizations doing business with them, and
the infrastructure itself. Let’s examine some of the toolset’s shared strings and functionality,
then move on to shared infrastructure.
Similar strings
While the Naikon backdoor maintained the user-agent string “NOKIAN95/WEB”, it also
maintained a debug path
f:\MyProjects\xServer\Release\xServer.pdb
Also, the Naikon backdoor’s matching management software is called “xsControl”. Plugins for
the Naikon backdoor included a screenshot grabber named xsAdv.dll, and a single export
“XS_Screencap”.
This debug path in Naikon backdoors is very similar to the debug path maintained in Rarstone
backdoors:
g:\MyProjects\xsFunction\Release\DLL.pdb
The MsnMM campaign backdoors all maintain an “MM” internal name, and the functionality
changes when comparing them:
WinMM
WininetMM
SslMM
A more recent oddity from this group includes a WinMM dropper with the internal name “Zhixin”,
creating a recently compiled Sys10 backdoor.
Some “MM” executables maintained debug strings across versions and families:
J:\chong\new\Release\SslMM.exe
and
J:\chong\nod\Release\SslMM.exe

Shared infrastructure

Now, let’s take a look at some of the shared infrastructure that helps to tie all of these
campaigns together. MsnMM backdoors and naikon backdoors share portions of infrastructure
across campaigns. For a quick example, early msnMM backdoors like sslMM, and one of the
later tools, exe_exchange, share some domains with the nokian95 (naikon) and sys10
backdoors. There is much crossover:
Here, you can see a table recording domains that are shared across the backdoors for
command and control infrastructure.

Correlating Target Profiles with Spearphish and Decoy Content
One of the most striking characteristics of this APT is that its targeting interest is revealed by its
spear-phish and decoy content. Malicious actors of all stripes, including cybercriminals, have for
at least the last ten years abused “hot topics” in their social-engineering content to better attract
and mass-exploit victim systems. It’s a pretty worn-out discussion. What is different about the
Naikon APT’s use of hot topics in spear-phish and decoy content is that reveals its specific
victims and how these change over time. Precision social engineering seems to be an elevated
skill set for the group.
A few of the most interesting examples of such content include: a UN discussion and vote on
nuclear proliferation and disarmament, the MH370 flight, and construction on the Raytheon-built
National Coast Watch Center in PH.
For example, in the second week of October 2012, during the gang’s intense ongoing focus on
SE Asian countries like Cambodia and its diplomats, we find a winMM backdoor detected as
"Trojan.Win32.Agent.udtc" in New York City. This verdictidentified the Naikon APT’s backdoor

on the victim system. The timing is uncanny because, in that same week speeches and views
on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were presented by SE Asian country delegates to
the United Nations in New York City. An example of such a talk is here; a naikon decoy’s
content was strikingly similar:

MsnMM campaigns most commonly presented spear-phish exploits targeting CVE-2012-0158.
A listing of screenshots in Appendix A reveals the variety of content and themes, all related to
events and topics in the ASEAN region. Example titles include:

The following example’s content was crafted to appear like a legitimate international agreement
discussion. After the malicious document is opened and successfully exploits CVE-2012-0158
on the victim workstation, the exploit code drops and opens this decoy Word document:

This next example is written with the Laotian Phetsarath OT font, a decoy attempt to be a
legitimate Daily News Brief from the Laotian Foreign Ministry of Affairs. It demonstrates the
group’s intentions to hit targets in Laos:

Appendix A contains many more example document titles and screenshots. The themes and
content that would appeal to politically-interested individuals in various parts of the world quickly
become obvious.
In addition to a high volume of files exploiting CVE-2012-0158, the MsnMM attackers for a brief
period used RTLO (right to left override) techniques, and then attachments exploiting CVE2010-3333. An example of RTLO that creates and opens this decoy document to camouflage its
malicious background activity, then dropping and executing MsnMM backdoors on its victim
system:

The MsnMM gang built and released many more variants of their sslMM creation. The code is a
full-featured backdoor. Each variant of this tool starts by attempting to create a socket, and then
creates a new thread implementing a fairly complicated keylogging facility not often seen, using
Windows Keyboard Accelerators. Online code demonstrates the technique here:
http://thronic.com/Win32%20Keylogging/
The backdoor retrieves a large number of victim system data points, which it then uses to check
in to its hardcoded C2. The backdoor reports system identification information both to present
the victim’s identifying information and to fingerprint the system for asset management:
● OS version
● Service pack information
● Processor speed
● System name
● Logged-on user name
● OS install date
One of its more interesting features is the ability to fetch and use certificates from the “My” store
on Windows systems. The “My” certificate store is created on a per-user basis, and this is where
users’ certificates are stored. It is reserved for each user for signing and decrypting data and
encrypting network communications.
Feature list:
● Victim fingerprinting and performance sensitivity - system configuration collection
● Persistence - immediately identifying the Start Menu Startup directory and dropping a
LNK to its own executable disguised as a “Office Start”, “Yahoo Talk”, “MSN Gaming
Z0ne”, or “MSN Talk” shortcut
● Configurable network settings - both a primary and backup C2 string is hard-coded in
each backdoor. At this point, we are aware of almost 50 domains and unique IP
addresses used to host C2
● Keylogging facility - Windows Accelerators with hidden window and lengthy Accelerator
table
● Flexible network connectivity - proxy support for use with victim systems situated behind
isolated networks
● GET and POST network code for exfiltrating system information
● Log file capabilities
● File search and file write primitives - identifying and collecting sensitive ondisk
information
● Download and execute further arbitrary downloads
● Arbitrary inter-process launch and communication through named pipes
● Process privilege and token adjustments
● Anti-malware kill-process identification and termination
● Digital Certificate stealing and reuse for stealth SSL communications
● Network server listener

WinMM is a full-featured, simple backdoor. Its first actions upon installation are to collect user
and system data and report them back to the C2 over http. It uses NetUserGetInfo to identify
that it is running under an “Admin” account on the local system, then retrieves the system name
and the version of the operating system that is running, including its service pack, and collects
the system install date from the registry:
\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\InstallDate.
These values are built into a single string for reporting.
SslMM also maintains this code chunk and functionality but does not immediately invoke it like
winMM. Also interesting and different from sslMM, are the decoy Word documents dropped by
many of the winMM droppers. Images of these documents are shown in the Appendix. The
documents are all written and formatted with a specially developed Myanmar2 True Type font,
demonstrating the focus on politically-connected, native Myanmar speakers as targets. This font
is not delivered by default with Microsoft Office. Instead, it must have been specifically installed
by the attackers and then by the victims, otherwise the documents would not have displayed
properly.
The backdoor maintains multiple primitive functionalities:
Setting a WH_CBT Windows hook for full activity spying (sslMM does not maintain this hooking
functionality):
●
●
●

File search and capture
Process creation
Keystroke capture

The backdoor is usually configured with primary and backup domains for C2 communications,
although there are multiple known samples that maintain an IP address or only a single domain
for communications with no backup. Communication is built to appear as though a web browser
is simply making a request to a remote web server. Some of these backdoors are configured to
use an unusual port for encrypted communications.

In 2014 the Naikon gang was found to be using another tool that maintains an internal name
“xsPlus” and “xsControl”. This builder and its backdoors produce components with the
“NOKIAN95/WEBx” user-agent strings, for which there are multiple versions. Its functionality is
covered in our previous Naikon APT post.
Naikon and minor links with APT30
Another interesting aspect of the backdoor builder is that it also provides a keylogger plugin that
is used on specific victim systems. And here there are minor, but striking, similarities with the
APT30 tools.
Callback sessions for stolen data include these URLs:
POST /stonehoof.rar/user=xxx&password=xxx
GET /stonehoof.rar/user=xxx&password=xxx

Some of the collector components upload data in SQLite3 format, while earlier versions of the
tool upload xml formatted data. Presenting a similarity with the APT30 artifacts, their callback
domains included stonehoof.com, hosted on several IPs during the naikon campaigns. This
name is very unusual, and it is an odd coincidence that it is shared by two geopolitically-focused
cyber-espionage groups, both targeting the South China Sea region.

174.36.159.164

While the MsnMM components include the unusual “MM” in internal names sslMM, winMM, and
wininetMM, some of the strings in the APT30 GEMSTONE software include the same – search
and retrieval of the registry key “Software\Microsoft\GetMM”, and three function names
“MicrosoftGMMExit, MicrosoftGMMHaveExit, MicrosoftGMMZJ”. The APT30 BACKSPACE
backdoor also contains a similar potential target reference, as discussed in the FireEye paper.
“BACKSPACE Variant
Path
Possible Target
ZJ Auto (version 1.4)
/autoMM/
Myanmar”
So, the “MM” shared by both of these may be a simple reference to Myanmar, the starting target
for these Naikon APT attacks.
APT30 backdoors also add “MSN.lnk” shortcuts to the Start Menu Startup location for
persistence, just like the MsnMM components spoof “Msn Gaming Zone.lnk” and “Msn Talk.lnk”
for persistence.

Yet another backdoor was used throughout 2013 by Naikon. Several of the C2 domains are
shared with either Naikon or MsnMM infrastructure. This backdoor is a very basic initial
component. To give an idea of the sophistication of its development, one of the decryption
schemes it uses is an xor 0x1 loop on the very beginning of its .data section to decrypt its C2
domain. In this case, 6C 6C 6A 62 66 2F 74 68 62 71 2F 6F 64 75 01 (lljbf/thbq/odu) →
mmkcg.uicp.net.

This weak level of encryption is odd, because other strings, like the unicode version of the
callback url “s.y.s.t.e.n.&.c.p.=.%.s.&.l.o.g.=.%.s.&.i.n.d.e.x.=.%.d.”, are maintained in plaintext
in the .rdata section. Perhaps the authors thought xor’ing the domains would hide their
infrastructure for as long as needed, or they were working with others who didn’t understand
automated sandboxes and tracing but didn’t want the dns strings present in the binary. It doesn’t
seem to make sense, but it appears to have been effective enough to leave in the executables.
For all of the “Sys10” backdoors, URL parameters were used consistently for the initial C2
callback: systen&cp=&log=&index=
where:
cp = system computername
log = signed decimal integer representation of the OS InstallDate
index = simply the return value from a GetTickCount call
The backdoor collects several bits of identifying information to send to the C2:
● computer name
● account name of logged-in user
● group name of logged-in user
● local IP address
● OS versioning information
● OS install date
The backdoor maintains a simple set of primitives:
● http-based communications with hardcoded C2
● download additional components
● start a new process
● terminate a running process
● find files and copy them
● delete files
● create files
We detected this backdoor on multiple victim workstations with the following verdicts:
Trojan.Win32.Agentb.hyb
Trojan.Win32.Agentb.iqj
Backdoor.Win32.MsnMM.p
UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic
Trojan.Win32.Agentb.jwp
According to KSN (Kaspersky Security Network) data, almost all of the victims attacked with this
backdoor are based in Myanmar, or were Myanmar delegates travelling through the other
countries like the US, for example. Some of the victims were located in Vietnam and Singapore.
Victim profiles range from global political representatives and local IT service companies, to

government ministries controlling media and news content, university students, and local law
enforcement agencies.

Second stage tools
Most of the Naikon APT’s second stage tools detected on victim networks are publicly-available.
Some are very common system administration tools and utilities, and some are less publiclyavailable custom written scanners and tools available through Chinese hacking forums. Their
ability to move through networks undisturbed appears to have matured over time, demonstrating
that they are a seasoned team:
● Windows system utilities: ftp.exe, systeminfo.exe, ipconfig, net view, ping, netstat -ano,
net use, quser, tasklist, netsh interface ip, netsh interface show, netsh advfirewall
firewall, reg export, AT
● Sysinternals: procmon.exe, tcpview.exe, procexep.exe, psexec
● Prosolve: winscan.exe
● Rarlabs: rar.exe
● Other: procex.exe, nc.exe, xscan.exe, winscanx.exe, hscan120.rar package (includes
mysql.exe and sqlcmd.exe), cutfile.exe, tftp.exe, Win7 elevation of privilege and UAC

bypass, ReadPSW.exe (password stealer)
The Naikon APT frequently used a custom backdoor that appears to be an HDoor variant,
based on old “Honker Union” code like “hscan v120”. For example, once on a victim network,
one of the first steps is to run the hdoor -hbs scan to identify target local network hosts.
Alternatively, it may show up on victim networks and be run with a long list of parameters:
“lms.dat -hscan 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.254 /a”

Shared Victims with Cycldek and Comparing Lateral Movement with Cycldek
The Cycldek APT appeared to follow an operational script across victim systems. It created or
used c:\intel on the victim hard disk to unpack tools and compress/archive stolen victim files and
data with Winrar, like "c:\intel\1.rar". Some of these victim systems were occupied by both the
Cycldec and Naikon attackers.
The Cycldek attackers maintained this c:\intel directory and its subdirectories as a sort of
staging point. This mirrors what we have seen with Naikon directory setup on some victims.
● a set of subdirectories
● stolen files for exfiltration
● operational logs
● process logs
● Cycldek tools and their config files
The Naikon APT and Cycldek APT also share a common attraction to Honker Union codebase.

Spear-phish, dropped files, web browser injection
The common sequence of events on a vulnerable system falling for related spear-phish attacks
led to a newly-created Internet Explorer process running with execution transferred to
additionally loaded executable code, usually profile.dat, maintaining the connectback C2
communication code and data.
In this instance, a “naikon backdoor” was delivered initially as a part of a small package of
objects. The exploit attachment dropped iph.bat, iExplorer.exe, and a clean decoy document.
The exploit executed this batch file, which in turn executed iExplorer.exe and opened a decoy
document from %temp%. The iExplorer.exe process wrote out a profile.dat file, launched the
legitimate Internet Explorer, and injected the .dat file into this newly created browser process. It
transfered control to the injected .dat code and terminated itself. The .dat code then connected
with a hardcoded C2 from within Internet Explorer, a common technique for evading any

outbound traffic firewall issues.
The full email spear-phish and other decoy documents’ content presented here display the
campaigns’ focus on ASEAN targets that line up with the MsnMM campaigns:

provider users in the US and Southeastern Asian region:

Many of these backdoors were delivered by simply binding decoy pdfs to a Naikon backdoor
and sending this bundle to target addresses. Here is a March 2014 spear-phish email with the
subject line “Fw: Fw: tape transcript for mh370” (3bed6788753690762c7d15a3247d8301):
The “tape transcript.zip” (5de5aa40eb3d30df2053a38bc26963b5) file contains both a pdf file
and a Naikon dropper name “24march_final_TAPE TRANSC~1” detected as “TrojanDropper.Win32.Injector.kasl” (4972c7205e3279322637f609b9199e97). The dropper maintains a
clean copy of this decoy pdf that opens on execution, [as well as?] the Naikon backdoor
(ab0185f3dc730af754559297f6f47492) and accompanying mshtml.dat component
(03A3251BDE74DF30AB5BF0B730E08C8D) that communicates with C2 xl.findmy.pw. This
dropper is built with the attackers’ “pdfBind 2012” tool. Once extracted to disk, you can see that
the icon was replaced for the executable with an Adobe pdf icon. Lots of users fall for this sort of
trick when file extensions are not visible:
