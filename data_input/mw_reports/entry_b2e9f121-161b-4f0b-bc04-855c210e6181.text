Geofenced Amazon Japan Credential Phishing Volumes Rival Emotet
October 16, 2020 Cassandra A. and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team

Introduction
Since August 2020, Proofpoint researchers have tracked extremely high-volume Amazon
Japan credential and information phishing campaigns, with suspected activity dating back to
June 2020. The messages pose as Amazon Japan, suggesting that the recipient needs to
review their account for "confirmation of ownership" or "updated payment information".
Upon clicking a link in the message, the recipient is taken to one of several variations of
Amazon-themed credential phishing landing pages that
collect credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), and credit card numbers.
Messages have been sent both to Japan-based organizations and those with a presence in
Japan. The pages are geofenced to ensure that only Japan-based recipients are taken to the
credential phishing page.
While popular brands like Amazon are often abused in credential phishing campaigns, the
volume of messages sets these campaigns apart from other Amazon-branded activity. The
campaigns run continuously, sending hundreds of thousands of messages each day. As
of mid-October, sometimes more than a million messages are seen in a single day,
rivaling Emotet message volume.

Lures and landing pages
The messages are well-crafted Japanese language lures with subjects suggesting that the
recipient's information needs an update or that their account has been locked:
Amazon.co.jp アカウント所有権の証明（名前、その他個人情報）の確
認 ("Confirmation of proof of ownership of Amazon.co.jp account (name and other
personal information)") (Figure 1)
お支払い方法の情報を更新 ("Updated payment method information") (Figure 2)

been locked") (Figure 3)

Images in the messages, such as the Amazon logos, are hotlinked from free image hosting
services, and the same image URLs have been observed across multiple campaigns.
The messages purport to be from Amazon, though they come from email addresses
that initially were not disguised particularly well, such as these samples:
rmlirozna[@]pw[.]com
5/14

fwgajk[@]zfpx[.]cn
info[@]bnwuabd[.]xyz
dc[@]usodeavp[.]com
By early October 2020, we began to see a shift in effort to make the from address appear
somewhat legitimate:
amaozn[@]ama2on[.]buzz
accout-update[@]amazon[.]co.jp
account-update[@]amazon[.]com
admin[@]amazon-mail[.]golf
In examining the message URLs, we see that they contain parameters for OpenID (Figure 4),
the authentication protocol used by Amazon Japan. These URLs don’t appear to take the user
to an OpenID implementation, but the parameters in the URL string exist to provide
legitimacy to the experience.
We identified what appear to be placeholder values in some URLs, suggesting perhaps some
messages were prematurely sent, or that the corresponding values weren’t available (Figure
4).

We also identified use of what appears to be a placeholder email address in some URLs,
“a@b.c” (Figure 5). In other URLs observed, the recipient email address populates this
parameter.

When clicked, the geofenced links in the message take the user either to a spoofed Amazon
Japan login page (Figure 6), or if the user appears to be outside of Japan, to the actual
Amazon Japan login page.

Upon “logging in” with their Amazon username and password, the user is taken to a form
that collects various pieces of PII, such as address, birthday, and phone number (Figure 7).

birthday, zip/postal code, prefecture (state), street address, business name (optional), and
phone number
The form also collects credit card numbers, which are loosely validated through a script
hosted on the same site, and zip codes, which are validated via an API call to a third-party
service (Figures 8, 9). Interestingly, the zip code we provided does not appear to be a
legitimate Japanese zip code, though no errors were returned upon submitting the
information.

string of the wrong length) is invalid

validation, as well as calls to ”/ap/actions/validate?cxdi=” for credit card number
validation
After submitting valid information, users are thanked for updating their information, told
they may now access their account, and redirected to the real Amazon Japan site at
amazon.co[.]jp.

Message volume

Figure 11: Message volume, August 2020 through October to date
Proofpoint has tracked these messages since mid-August, but we have identified activity as
early as June 2020 that appears to be tied to the same actor. While the messages are in
Japanese and the landing pages geofenced to Japanese IPs, there is no clear pattern among
10/14

recipients or industries, beyond being based in Japan or having business presence in
Japan. Given the loosely linear trajectory of daily message volume observed through late
August and September, volume could continue to increase over the coming months.

Average Message Volume Per Day

Infrastructure
Typically, the credential phishing landing page is an IP address, followed by “/ap/signin”:
hxxp://103.192.179[.]54/ap/signin
Less often, a domain is used in lieu of an IP address:
00pozrjbpm[.]xyz/ap/signin
Hundreds of IP addresses have been used across multiple campaigns, as the actor tends to
adopt new IP addresses for each campaign, rather than reuse IP addresses. IP
addresses belong to a variety of autonomous systems, with no clear pattern
among geographies or providers.

The domains used are *.xyz or *.cn TLDs, and some have been observed across multiple
campaigns. The .xyz domains are registered through GoDaddy, while the *.cn domains has
a sponsoring registrar of 阿里云计算有限公司（万网） (Alibaba Cloud Computing).

Apart from 00pozrjbpm[.]xyz, reused from the August 30-September 5 campaign, the
domains for the September 6-12 campaign share common traits. Like the previous set of
domains, the creation dates and registrant information suggest that they may be related in
some way. Moreover, “rxbnn3[@]163[.]com” is a prolific domain registrant, as this address
appears as a registrant contact across 251 domains as of this publication. In addition to the
domains associated with rxbnn3[@]163[.]com shown above, the email is also linked to a
number of domain generation algorithm-like domains:
swwkppe[.]cn
lmkafwgi[.]cn
pdscmkq[.]cn
awsmgrc[.]cn

Conclusion
The Amazon brand is commonly spoofed by threat actors seeking credentials, but the volume
and persistence of these campaigns set them apart from other Amazon-themed activity. The
consistent reuse of message assets, landing pages, and steadily increasing message volume
suggest that this activity could be driven by a botnet. Moreover, there is no apparent weekend
lull in message volume, as we sometimes observe with less automated operations. If this is
indeed powered by a botnet, it’s unlikely that message volume will decrease soon. Threat
actors often make incremental changes to their operations, and elements like different
branding or collection of slightly different information could be easy pivot points for this
actor over the coming months.
