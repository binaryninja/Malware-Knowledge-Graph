EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The BlackBerry 2021 Threat Report examines the biggest cybersecurity events of last year and the
security issues likely to affect the upcoming year. By publishing this information, we hope to minimize
the damage of future cyber attacks and strengthen the global security posture.

MAJOR EVENTS IMPACTING CYBERSECURITY IN 2020
The most obvious cybersecurity event of the year was COVID-19. The pandemic created many opportunities
for threat actors. Businesses worldwide struggled to implement secure work-from-home policies while
the public weathered multiple COVID-19-themed attacks.
Mercenary threat groups also experienced another year of growth as unscrupulous actors and
organizations outsourced their cyber attacks. Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offerings continued
to grow in popularity, replacing the traditional off-the-shelf ransomware attacks seen in previous years.
Off-the-shelf toolkits were still active throughout the year, simplifying cyber attacks with ready-made
exploit kits, malspam campaigns, and threat emulation software like Cobalt Strike.
Cryptocurrency also had a strong year. Bitcoin hitting new price highs in January 2021 may signal an
upcoming increase in ransomware and cryptojacking attacks.

CYBERSECURITY ISSUES IN 2020 AND 2021

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Election security was a topic of great interest in 2020. Reporting focused primarily on electronic voting
machines, but gave little attention to obvious attack vectors like non-secure mobile devices and social
media harvesting. On a positive note, recent strides in critical event management offer hope that largescale disasters will be more efficiently anticipated and mitigated in the future.

This abbreviated overview outlines the overall
content of the report, but a great deal of valuable
information remains within the lengthier sections.
For more insight on any of the topics covered in
this report, please contact us or visit BlackBerry
at www.blackberry.com .

The BAHAMUT group, known by several other names and aliases, remained active in the South Asia
and Persian Gulf regions. Meanwhile, Emotet, the banking-trojan-turned-attack-platform, received new
upgrades and capabilities, including a flaw that allowed researchers to temporarily shut it down.
The U.N. created cybersecurity guidelines for automakers, laying the groundwork for increased vehicle
security. National governments are also taking a serious look at security issues. The United States and
Canada are both poised to pass new cybersecurity legislation affecting hundreds of millions of people.
Smartphones came under attack as innovative threat actors found new ways to exploit users’ expectations
and trigger malicious GUI overlays. Deepfake threats continued to plague high profile users, but declined
overall as threat groups embraced COVID-19-themed attacks.

INTRODUCTION
The BlackBerry 2021 Threat Report contains a broad range of cybersecurity topics vital to the interests
of businesses, governments, and end-users. As always, the BlackBerry Threat Report represents our
piece of the overall security puzzle. Our goal is to make security information, predictions, and lessons
learned accessible to everyone, regardless of role or title.
The BlackBerry 2021 Threat Report examines 2020’s major security
events and considers recent advancements that may prevent
past mistakes from repeating. It provides a deep dive into current
cybersecurity issues with an eye toward not merely chronicling what
happened but analyzing the conditions that allowed for those events.
That said, this report is not intended to be merely a retrospective
examination of the major threats of 2020. It is a high-level look at
the security issues affecting the hyper-connected world of today.
It covers elements of COVID-19 exploitation, the Internet of things
(IoT), election vulnerabilities, remote working, connected vehicle
security, and other contemporary issues.
Preparation, as this report will demonstrate, is a key factor in
successful threat prevention. Threat actors throughout the world
are continuously developing new attack strategies and waiting for
opportune moments to strike. Preparing for upcoming cyber attacks
requires around-the-clock monitoring of the threat landscape.
Understanding how current events impact your organization’s
attack surface can make the difference between a data breach
and a successful cyber defense.
Preventing attacks is not always possible through preparation, but
can largely be achievable through various techniques made possible
by artificial intelligence (AI). Highly advanced cybersecurity AI can
read the digital DNA of software and determine if it poses a threat.
AI-driven security agents can monitor user and system behavior,
location, and access patterns looking for signs of abnormal or

malicious behavior. While no security approach is 100% successful,
AI-driven cybersecurity offers organizations a strong defense
against both legacy and emerging threats.
The Solar Winds incident, reported in December 2020, reminded
the world that effective threat detection is a critical component of a
secure environment. Indiscriminate malware attacks often raise red
flags, but the most insidious attacks may come from trusted entities
quietly operating undetected. World-class threat actors are often
experts at subterfuge, mimicry, and obfuscation as demonstrated
in the BAHAMUT section of this report. As threat actors execute
more sophisticated attacks, organizations must likewise respond
with increasingly robust threat detection.
It is inevitable that some attacks will succeed, and this report
contains many examples of unfortunate targets who were
breached by threat actors. However, effective incident response
procedures can minimize damage to business operations and
brand name. Responding to an attack requires organizations to fix
the vulnerabilities their adversaries have successfully exploited.
Accordingly, the BlackBerry 2021 Threat Report offers suggestions
on how current vulnerabilities can be repaired in connected vehicles,
mobile technology, elections, and more. We sincerely hope the
information contained in this report will help readers be more
effective in their efforts to combat today’s cyber threats.
Team BlackBerry

In 2020, a Check Point report estimated that “Coronavirus-themed domains” had a 50% greater likelihood
of being malicious than other domains registered in the same period1. If we take this finding as a preview
of what was to come, 2020 did not disappoint. The global COVID-19 pandemic delivered new threats for
both business and individuals alike.
Businesses, especially those not requiring face-to-face interactions,
had to contend with rapidly shifting the majority of their workforce
to work from home. This caused an unprecedented transition from
enterprise infrastructure and security, to home Wi-Fi, virtual private
networks (VPN), and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) configurations.
The ramifications of that paradigm shift resulted in inadequate
protections for employees and businesses. At the same time, the
overall attack surface available to bad actors significantly increased.
Attack vectors previously protected within the secure confines of
the business premises and network potentially became an open
path to confidential business data. This transition led to a huge
rise in security breaches. Remote workers are cited as the cause of
breaches for 20% of organizations since the start of the pandemic2.
Individuals, along with trying to stay both mentally and physically
healthy during a pandemic, had to contend with an onslaught of
COVID-19-themed cyber attacks. One attack saw cyber criminals
prey on their victims’ concerns for their own welfare. Attackers
attempted to trick users into installing a COVID-19 tracker
application on their Android phones. The app would subsequently
install CovidLock ransomware that locks the user out of their phones
until they pay a $100 ransom3.

The closure of many businesses drove a natural trend towards
online shopping, resulting in a 36% increase in online retail sales
for Q3 of 2020. The increase in online shopping resulted in a surge
in package delivery scams4. Scams might include a seemingly
innocuous text message containing a fake tracking link. When the
link is clicked it installs malware or directs the user to a website that
prompts them to enter personal information. Other scams claim
that a fee must be paid or provide users a call back number that has
high associated cost-per-minute rates.

Overall, there is clear evidence that both COVID-19 and the switch
to working from home created new opportunities for bad actors to
prey on workers’ vulnerabilities. Threat actors exploited both our
security posture and our instinct for self-preservation to profit from
the pandemic. Scammers are always going to take advantage of
opportunities created from national, international, and global events.
We, as a security community, need to effectively address the security
implications introduced by working remotely for the majority.

THREAT ACTIVITY IN 2020

APT MERCENARIES:
HACKERS FOR HIRE

RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE

CRYPTOJACKING

BlackBerry researchers noted a continued rise in the outsourcing
of cyber espionage to mercenary APT groups. The operations of
BAHAMUT, one of the most elusive, patient, and effective threat
actors is examined later in this report. Newer groups, such as
CostaRicto, have also been targeting seemingly disparate victims
worldwide with their customized backdoors and tooling.

Ransomware is a common and growing threat5. Ransomware
targets have expanded from random individuals to larger, more
critical organizations, like those in the healthcare industry. There
has also been a recent change in ransomware tactics to include
extortion attempts. Attackers have moved from merely threatening
catastrophic data loss, to threatening to publish exfiltrated data
to damage the victim’s brand. Threatening to publish stolen data
results in a greater likelihood of ransomware payment6.

Bitcoin (and therefore cryptomining) has been around since 2009.
Cryptominers receive bitcoin by verifying transactions and solving
numeric hashing problems. The rate at which bitcoin is mined is
halved every four years. This halving inversely affects the difficulty
of mining and therefore the computing power required to effectively
mine bitcoin8. Modern miners need to invest in graphics processing
units (GPUs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to
have any hope of being competitive, and even then, they are fighting
an uphill battle.

From a high-level perspective, the tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) of these mercenaries often resemble highly
sophisticated state-sponsored campaigns. However, the profiles
and geography of their victims are far too diverse to be aligned with
a single bad actor’s interests.
In theory, the customers of a mercenary APT include anyone who
can afford it, but the more sophisticated actors will naturally choose
to work with patrons of the highest profile. Plausible employers
of skilled APTs would include large organizations, influential
individuals, or governments. Cyber criminals must be extremely
discerning when selecting their commissions to avoid the risk
of being exposed.
Outsourcing cyber espionage efforts might be attractive to
disreputable businesses and individuals who lack the required tooling,
infrastructure, and experience to conduct an attack themselves.
Or, notorious adversaries experienced in cyber espionage could
benefit from adding a layer of indirection to their attacks. Using a
mercenary as a proxy can protect the identity of the real attacker
and thwart attempts at attribution. Threat actor identification can
be challenging for threat researchers due to several factors such as
overlapping infrastructure, disparate targeting, and unusual tactics.
This is especially true when only part of a campaign is outsourced,
such as initial access via phishing.

There has also been a transition away from off-the-shelf ransomware,
which may be outdated or have questionable efficacy. Threat actors
are increasingly embracing RaaS, which offers vendor support
and better results for the cyber criminal due to frequent updates
by the RaaS distributor. These features bear an increased cost to
the attacker who agrees to pay a percentage of the ransom. The
higher cost is passed on to the victims, as evidenced by the increase
in average ransom demands. Coveware reports show ransom
payments increased by an average of 33% in Q1 of 20207. Four of
the top six ransomware variants use the RaaS business model. This
marks a noticeable evolution in the ransomware business model
and indicates the trend is likely to continue.

Cryptojacking offers an illicit way to work around the rising costs of
cryptomining. Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of a computer
to mine cryptocurrency9. Cryptojacking software is generally either
file-based or browser-based and infections can occur in a variety of
ways. Possible infection vectors include malspam, injected mining
scripts from websites, and delivery as part of a later stage in cyber
attacks. Cryptojackers often target high-powered servers in an
enterprise environment in order to maximize their mining activities.
One legitimate mining software, which is oftentimes abused for
cryptojacking campaigns, is XMRig miner, used to mine Monero10.
Cryptojacking activity tends to increase or decrease depending on
the price of cryptocurrency11. As of this writing, bitcoin and other
cryptocurrency prices are experiencing all-time highs12.

THREAT ACTIVITY IN 2020

Malspam is malware that is delivered via email and uses a tested,
off-the-shelf, campaign format. Malspam campaigns vary from
using widespread and indiscriminate targeting to being highly
specific and sophisticated ventures focusing on one or two key
individuals. Given the overwhelming popularity of email, malspam
continues to be a risk to both businesses and private users alike.

Using timely topics like COVID-19 as the subject for a malspam
campaign increases the likelihood of a successful infection13. The
malicious payload delivered by malspam can vary from additional
spam/malspam sending bots, to ransomware, to more advanced
threats. For example, BlackBerry researchers discovered malspam
delivering a malicious HTML application (.hta) file containing an
obfuscated MSBuild profile for a Cobalt Strike beacon.

Exploit Kits
Exploit kits (EKs) became popular as an automated infection vector
in 2006. They are primarily used to mass distribute commodity
malware by exploiting unpatched/vulnerable systems in order
to trigger a drive-by download. In simple terms, EKs attempt
to detect a vulnerability in a browser-related application then
exploit it to download and execute a malicious payload. The
downloaded payloads vary across exploit kits and the campaigns
that leverage them.
EKs can be rented from their creators through exploit-kits-as-aservice (EKaaS) for around $900 USD per month14. EK activity has
been relatively low for several quarters but is starting to increase as
payloads shift from ransomware to banking trojans15. Exploit kits
also continue to advance in terms of complexity and vulnerability
coverage, as shown by the Purple Fox exploit kit. Purple Fox’s latest
updates included recent CVEs16 and rootkit capabilities used to
avoid detection and hinder analysis17.

THREAT ACTIVITY IN 2020

OFF-THE-SHELF THREATS
Remote Access

Enumeration

Lateral Movement

Cobalt Strike

AdFind/SharpHound

Mimikatz/LaZagne

Cobalt Strike is a fully featured and supported threat emulation
software that is still under active development. In some cases, it
may prove cheaper and faster than developing in-house tooling,
with licensing starting at $3,500 per year18. These factors have
contributed to it becoming one of the most prevalent and favored
tools among red teams and attackers19.

Adfind is a command line utility used to enumerate Active Directory
for information such as:

Mimikatz is a widely used tool in the post-exploitation phase of
an attack. It is used to aid lateral movement. Threat actors use
Mimikatz to steal credentials from a compromised host and
discover other credentials, allowing them to move laterally within
the network environment27. It was recently updated to include
exploit code for CVE-2020-1472, the critical ZeroLogon privilege
escalation vulnerability28. The combination of Mimikatz and
Zerologon on an unpatched system could prove devastating for an
entire enterprise network29.

There have also been incidents where source code and cracked
copies of Cobalt Strike were leaked. These copies were subsequently
leveraged in malicious attacks on enterprises by a growing number
of APT groups such as APT32, APT27, and APT29.
Cobalt Strike and Metasploit are the two most common penetration
testing frameworks available on the market. A recent report20
estimates that more than 25% of the malicious command and control
(C2) servers deployed in 2020 rely on Cobalt Strike and Metasploit.
Approximately 82% of all beacons analyzed by BlackBerry appear
to come from leaked or cracked copies. The prolific use of these
widely available copies makes it difficult to attribute their malicious
activity to a specific group.

Adfind has been leveraged by APTs22 and commodity malware
groups like “one”23, the group behind Ryuk ransomware distribution.
Threat actors use Adfind to gather information for further probing
or moving laterally within an infected environment. SharpHound,
the data collection component of BloodHound24, is another Active
Directory enumeration utility. It is used to map out potentially unseen
relationships within a domain25. Such mappings can provide an
attacker with the shortest and sometimes easiest path to achieve
Domain Admin privileges within an environment26. SharpHound
comes in multiple forms, including a DotNet compiled executable
(.exe) file and a PowerShell script where the assembly has been
obfuscated. BlackBerry has observed the use of both AdFind and
SharpHound by malicious threat actors during 2020 and expect to
see them again in 2021.

Mimikatz has been a longstanding staple of the attacker toolkit.
Given the popularity of Mimikatz, one can safely assume that
most antivirus and endpoint detect and response products have
built-in mechanisms to protect against or detect its usage. This
creates the opportunity for the development of competing products
for retrieving credentials from a system. One such alternative is
LaZagne30. LaZagne contains a Mimikatz-like module (pypykatz31)
but includes versions for Linux and Mac as well as Windows. It
can also target software such as browsers, mail clients, and Wi-Fi
configurations among others.

Filecoder

NukeSped

FinSpy

Filecoder, aka FindZip or Patcher, is a notable ransomware family
affecting MacOS. Unlike many other ransomware strains, this family
seems to be more focused on destruction than generating revenue.
Files are encrypted with a pseudo-randomly generated key and a
ransom note is dropped to the desktop demanding payment to
restore the encrypted data. However, during execution nothing is
transmitted back to the threat actor. This means that if the victim
pays the threat actor, they will receive no decryption assistance as
the keys are not known by either party.

NukeSped was discovered as a trojan cryptocurrency application for
MacOS in late 2019 and attributed to APT38/Lazarus36. Attackers
faked company information and a landing page to lend their
campaign an air of legitimacy. The landing page also distributed the
malicious application, based on research done by Patrick Wardle.

FinSpy, also known as FinFisher, is spyware created and sold by the
German company FinFisher Gmbh. It has been attributed to multiple
attacks and privacy violations against human rights defenders
according to Amnesty International37. Campaigns using FinSpy
have been used against citizens in countries such as Bahrain,
Ethiopia, UAE, and Turkey. FinSpy contracts were also associated
with previous Egyptian authorities.

Samples of Filecoder were detected masquerading as a crack
tool for popular software on torrent sites. This successful tactic
underscores the importance of only downloading and running
software from reputable sources and not blindly allowing execution
from untrusted applications. Filecoder depends on zip functionality
to perform the encryption. Luckily, a known plaintext attack on zip’s
functionality can be used to decrypt the data without needing the
generated encryption keys35.

NukeSped capabilities include persistence via a launch daemon,
system information gathering, and network connectivity to the threat
actors for secondary attack stages. Later stages are presumed to
be downloaded and executed in memory as an attempt to thwart
detection. NukeSped is not signed, so Gatekeeper, by default, will
warn the user and request permission to execute. This is another
reminder to not install or run software from an untrusted source.

The software can access private communications and data and
record live audio and video directly from the infected device. MacOS
variants of FinSpy exploit bugs in older versions of OSX or ask the
user to allow elevated permissions if unsuccessful. C2 servers are
used for communication between the victim device and the attacker
to transfer data and initiate recording38.

EvilQuest

AppleJeus

Dacls RAT

EvilQuest/ThiefQuest is a MacOS ransomware that was discovered
in mid-2020. Ransomware is not as common on MacOS as some
other operating systems, but it is becoming more prolific over time.
EvilQuest ransomware has been found in illegitimate copies of
MacOS and trojanized versions of other software.

AppleJeus is malware associated with the threat actor group
APT38/Lazarus. It targets users involved in cryptocurrency trading.
To boost the legitimacy of their operation, the attackers allegedly
created a fake cryptocurrency trading platform offering download
installers for both Windows OS and macOS. Running the installer
gave the threat group access to the host system.

The Dacls remote access trojan (RAT) originally targeted Windows
and Linux systems but a variant for MacOS was found in mid-2020.
The malware is believed to be associated with the APT38/
Lazarus threat group. Social engineering is a common attack
vector for Lazarus and was used in this case as well. It is believed
that users are infected by executing trojanized downloads that
contain the malware.

Under normal conditions, MacOS Gatekeeper would prompt the user
to confirm execution privileges, as the samples encountered were
not signed. The malware also requests administrative privileges
from the active user. EvilQuest uses a launch daemon to achieve
persistence. The malware has remote code execution functionality
so data such as user certificates and cryptocurrency wallets can
be exfiltrated to the C2 server39.

AppleJeus achieves persistence via a created launch daemon. Once
running, the malware will gather basic system information and relay
it to the C2 server. The C2 server will respond with tasks if certain
conditions are met40.

Similar to other MacOS malware, Dacls RAT achieves persistence
through the use of a launch agent. The RAT has C2 communication
capability to execute commands remotely, perform file transfers and
network scanning, and process enumeration and management41.

Mirai

Gafgyt

Tsunami

Mirai is a prolific botnet that targets vulnerabilities in networking
hardware like home routers and IoT devices such as Internetconnected cameras. It uses default credentials and general
dictionary attacks to gain access to vulnerable devices based on
various architectures.

The Gafgyt botnet first appeared in 2014, targeting the ShellShock/
Bashdoor vulnerability. The source code was publicly leaked, which
led to many malware variants that target various devices like IP
cameras and routers across numerous architectures. Gafgyt
has also targeted video gaming services in addition to consumer
networks such as Valve’s Source Engine services and Fortnite47.

Tsunami is also known as Muhstik, Radiation, Amnesia, and
Kaiten49. The Tsunami botnet is known for targeting IoT devices and
communicating using the IRC protocol. Tsunami is part of the highly
discussed Linux Mint distribution compromise that led to ISOs of
the distribution to ship with the threat baked in50. This threat utilizes
vulnerabilities ranging from hardcoded admin credentials to those
in content management systems such as Drupal51.

The Mirai source code was made public in 2016 and has since seen
numerous changes and additions as new variants are discovered
in the wild. The original leaked code is still available on GitHub
for research purposes42. The original code contains a range of IP
addresses that are explicitly not valid during the target IP generation
process. The U.S. Department of Defense, United States Postal
Service, Hewlett-Packard, General Electric, and internal network
ranges are specifically mentioned within the codebase43. These
government entities and corporations have been assigned large
ranges of IPv4 space. For example, the whole of 56.0.0.0/8 is
assigned to USPS44.

Gafgyt attack methods and specific exploits have changed over the
years as new builds are found, including variants discovered in 2020.
This threat is also known as BASHLITE, qbot, and torlus48. Gafgyt
continues to be an active threat in 2020, a recurring theme as the
family was also covered in the BlackBerry 2020 Threat Report.

Mirai is attributed to the widely covered DDoS attack on a top
investigative journalist’s blog, Krebs On Security. This attack broke
records for DDoS traffic at the time45. Mirai was also used for a
DDoS attack on Dyn46. The malware continues to be an active
threat in 2020.

IPStorm

WellMess

FritzFrog

The IPStorm botnet was discovered in 2019. It is written in Golang,
which uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer
(p2p) filesharing and networking system for communication.
Communication may route through many legitimate peers between
the threat actor and the intended target. This routing makes it
difficult to differentiate malicious traffic as it is mixed with benign
traffic throughout the IPFS network52.

WellMess was first publicly referenced in 2018 by JPCert. It has
evolved from initially targeting Windows machines to infecting
Linux along with other communication protocols. The malware
allows remote code execution and file transfers56.

First discovered in January 2020, FritzFrog is written in Golang
and has quickly become a notable botnet. FritzFrog targets SSH
services and attempts to brute force credentials to gain access.
Many botnets use common credential combinations around built-in
accounts such as root, but FritzFrog uses a much larger dictionary
to cast a wider net.

This threat originally targeted Windows systems but has branched
into supporting multiple architectures on Linux, including Android.
Infection occurs by either brute forcing SSH credentials or, in the
case of Android, looking for exposed debug functionality53.
IPStorm was discovered by Intezer. On Linux, IPStorm issued
numerous requests to the Steam API, a gaming service provided
by Valve, querying possible stolen accounts on the service54. Intezer
also discovered evidence of devices infected with IPStorm being
used to create fraudulent advertisement views55.

WellMess is associated with threat group APT29 by multiple
sources, including the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security
Centre, Canada’s Communications Security Establishment, and
the United States’ National Security Agency. Also known as
WellMail, this campaign targets organizations connected with the
research and development of COVID-19 treatments. WellMess is
written in Golang and utilizes multiple avenues of attack, including
publicly known CVEs against software such as Citrix, Pulse Secure,
FortiGate, and Zimbra57.

FritzFrog is unique in the sense that it does not rely on commonly
used communication protocols, instead using a custom p2p
implementation. Operations are also done completely in-memory,
avoiding the use of the filesystem. In some cases, FritzFrog is also
associated with Monero cryptominers58.

BazarLoader

Astaroth

BazarLoader, otherwise known as KEGTAP, is a recently uncovered
malware loader. It has been described by researchers as having
close ties to the infamous Trickbot malware variant. The two threats
share various similarities in codebase and infrastructure. First
seen in April 2020, BazarLoader’s name is derived from its use of
EmerDNS blockchain domains for C2 communications, specifically
the use of .bazar domains.

First spotted in the wild in 2017, Astaroth is an information-stealing
malware variant that targeted Brazilian users. From its initial
inception to the present day, it has evolved in sophistication and
capabilities across numerous campaigns. Astaroth now targets
users both in North America and Europe, and deploys measures to
avoid detection from victims and security vendors alike.

BazarLoader typically uses spam and phishing emails as an infection
vector. Once downloaded to a machine, the malware attempts
to connect to a C2 .bazar domain. Upon a successful check-in,
the malware uses process injection techniques to attempt to run
undetected in the address space of legitimate Windows processes.
As its name suggests, BazarLoader proceeds to sleep for a short
time before attempting to download a malware payload from the
attacker’s C2. Cobalt Strike has been seen deployed in the wild
within a BazarLoader attack chain; however, the payload may be
anything of the attackers choosing. BazarLoader also uses heavy
code obfuscation, stealthy installation, and a sophisticated C2
infrastructure, making it a severe threat to any company or user.

Utilizing spam emails as its primary infection vector, Astaroth has
refined its execution chain to employ a sophisticated multi-stage
process that includes:

0
0
0

Making use of malicious iframes
Highly obfuscated JScript staged downloaders
.lnk files to retrieve the malware payload once an unwitting user
clicks an embedded link in the spam email

Upon infection, the malware uses various fileless techniques, injects
into numerous legitimate Windows processes, and adopts the use
of living-off-the-land tactics. The malware uses or abuses legitimate
utilities that are already installed on a system such as “bitsadmin.
exe”. This hijacking of legitimate resources is an attempt to avoid
suspicion and remain undetected on a victim host.

Later versions of Astaroth incorporated Alternate Data Stream (ADS)
functionality and the abuse of different living-off-the-land binaries
(LOLBins) such as “extexport.exe”. It also included Facebook and
YouTube within its attack life cycle, abusing these sites to send and
store C2 configuration data as posts on user profiles. These new
capabilities demonstrate that Astaroth is a continuously evolving
and sophisticated threat. Information targeted by Astaroth includes
financial data, sensitive browser data (passwords/credentials),
SSH, and email credentials. Upon retrieval, the information is
typically encrypted, then exfiltrated via an HTTPS POST to the
attacker’s C2 server.
Astaroth remains a sophisticated and prevalent threat by making
use of heavy obfuscation, stealth, and living-off-the-land techniques.
Astaroth’s ability to steal a wide array of sensitive information and
maintain a sophisticated C2 infrastructure makes it dangerous to
companies and users today.

Bladabindi
First identified in 2012, Bladabindi, also known as njRAT, has gained
popularity due to several tutorial videos available on YouTube and
the builders being available on GitHub. This remote access trojan
malware is especially popular among Middle Eastern threat actors.
The initial creators of Bladabindi are an underground attack group
called Sparclyheason. Bladabindi can activate web cameras, log
keystrokes, capture screenshots, steal passwords, execute remote
commands, and more. The malware is written in .NET and consists
of two main classes – kl and OK. The kl class is used for keylogging
while the OK class has other Bladabindi RAT functionalities. The
OK class also contains a hardcoded 32-character long string value
consisting of lowercase letters and numbers, unique per sample.

This string value is used when malware installs itself at autostart for persistence under
‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ab1c039a01d925ae481774f412396f5e’
and
‘HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

Cerber
The first variants of Cerber ransomware appeared in March
2016. The malware uses an RaaS model and is offered in Russian
underground forums. Implementing Cerber via the RaaS model
increases the number and reach of attacks. Cerber affiliates are
responsible for finding and infecting victims while the developers
take a commission of up to 40% of any ransom amounts collected.
During execution, Cerber will first check the country of the infected
endpoint. If it finds this to be located in any of the following nations,
it will terminate its execution and not encrypt the system:

0
0
0
0
0
0

Armenia
Azerbaijan
Belarus
Georgia
Kyrgyzstan
Kazakhstan

0
0
0
0
0

Moldova
Russia
Turkmenistan
Tajikistan
Ukraine
Uzbekistan

Often, malware developers will avoid attacking endpoints within
their own geographical region. This assists in limiting their exposure
and avoids drawing the attention of local authorities. If the infected
host passes the location check, Cerber creates a copy of itself in
the victim’s %APPDATA% folder under a random name chosen from
the System32 directory. The malware scans all drives and begins
its encryption process silently in the background using AES-256
and RSA encryption.
Cerber ensures no system backups are available and prevents the
execution of antivirus applications and Windows security features.
Files required for regular operations are encrypted, making the
system unusable to the user. Early variants of the malware appended
the file extension “.cerber” to encrypted files, although over time,
other extensions have also been used.
When the encryption has successfully completed, a ransom message
is displayed. The ransom is requested in bitcoin and, as an added
incentive to pay, a time limit may be provided before the amount
increases. Victims choosing to pay the ransom to retrieve their data
have no guarantee the affiliate distributing Cerber will provide a
decryption tool.

Emotet

Kwampirs

Ryuk

Emotet is an advanced, modular banking trojan that primarily
functions as a downloader or dropper of other banking trojans.
It is a polymorphic threat, able to evade typical signature-based
detection. It has several methods for maintaining persistence,
including auto-start registry keys and services. It uses modular
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to continuously evolve and update
its capabilities.

Kwampirs is a remote access trojan that targets supply chain
software providers of critical industries. The malware made a
resurgence in 2020 alongside the outbreak of COVID-19, which has
left many industries, healthcare in particular, facing tough times.
Attack groups deploying Kwampirs have been taking advantage
of the vulnerabilities these industries are facing by attacking their
supply chains. The attacks are having such a devastating effect
that the FBI released multiple alerts to warn potentially impacted
industries and services.

Since first appearing in August 2018, Ryuk has specifically targeted
enterprise environments, similar to other ransomware families
such as Samas and BitPaymer. Upon its release, researchers
from Checkpoint conducted a code comparison between the
initial versions of Ryuk and the Hermes ransomware variant. They
discovered that the two threats were highly similar in nature.
Researchers therefore concluded that Ryuk was, in fact, a derivative
of the Hermes source code that has been steadily developed since
its inception.

The Kwampirs RAT is a fully featured backdoor that uses a two-phase
approach. The initial phase establishes a wide and persistent
presence on the target network. In this initial phase, the trojan uses
hidden admin shares to propagate via SMB port 445. The malware
is modular and can download additional modules on the target. This
occurs in the second phase where all C2 network traffic is carried
out. Kwampirs uses HTTP GET requests on port 80 and includes
the encrypted date in the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

Hermes has always been considered commodity malware, meaning
that it has been used by various threat actors and observed for sale
on numerous underground forums. Ryuk, on the other hand, has
been attributed to a Russian-based threat actor dubbed WIZARD
SPIDER. Also, unlike Hermes, Ryuk has traditionally been used to
target larger enterprise environments and organizations in attempts
to obtain a high-ransom return.

Emotet is also virtual-machine-aware and can generate false
indicators if run in a virtual environment. It is disseminated through
malspam that uses branding familiar to the recipient. It has even
been spread using the MS-ISAC name. The 2020 Emotet campaign
distributed malspam in large quantities. Like many other threat
actors, Emotet distributors took advantage of the COVID-19 global
pandemic, which affected millions worldwide. The latest Emotet
campaign sent a high volume of emails with subject lines like
“COVID test results”, which contained a malicious link or PDF.
Initial infection occurs when a user opens or clicks the malicious
download link, PDF, or macro-enabled Microsoft Word document.
Once downloaded, Emotet establishes persistence and attempts to
propagate through the local networks using incorporated spreader
modules. Further details about recent advancements in Emotet
appear later in this report.

One example occurred in June 2019, when the State of Florida paid
over $1,000,000 to bring the city’s systems back online. Affected
entities included police, SCADA, and water-related systems.
WIZARD SPIDER is also believed to be behind the Trickbot variant
of banking malware. This may explain why Ryuk has recently
been seen being deployed in a triple-threat scenario along
with Trickbot and Emotet.

Trickbot is an advanced modular banking trojan that was first
reported in 2016. It was originally designed to steal sensitive user
content, including banking credentials and other personal data.
The creators have since expanded its capabilities by adding new
modules to evade detection efforts and enhance functionality.
Some of the modules added facilitate VNC-base remote access,
lateral movement, and the installation of a UEFI/BIOS firmware
implant for persistence (as reported by AdvIntel and Eclypsium).
The sophisticated firmware implant means Trickbot can survive
even after reformatting the hard drive. Trickbot also developed into
a platform-as-a-service, allowing it to deliver additional malware
such as Ryuk and Conti Ransomware.

added a process injection method (mostly against explorer.exe)
and the ability to drop other malware via weaponized documents.
Later versions of this malware include anti-analysis and anti-debug
checks to protect itself and detect any antivirus vendor presence.

Trickbot is often distributed by Emotet spam trojan as a secondstage payload. It is also delivered via spam campaigns that capitalize
on enticing subjects related to unpaid invoices, purchase orders,
or other financial transactions. In 2020, Trickbot operators added
COVID-19-related terms into their phishing and malspam lures.
Like many other threat actors, Trickbot distributors took advantage
of the COVID-19 global pandemic affecting millions worldwide.
According to Microsoft’s ATP data, Trickbot is the most prolific
malware operation using COVID-19-themed lures.
Despite recent efforts by Microsoft and the FBI to disrupt Trickbot
servers, this malware family still poses a serious threat. The threat
actors behind this malware continued their operations, adding
features and pushing new updates to make it more resilient against
future takedowns.

CYBERSECURITY INSIGHTS

SECURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS
Beyond the Ballot
Often, electronic voting systems are the focus of electoral security,
but elections can be attacked through a number of different means.
Consider the sheer number of smartphones, tablets, laptops,
desktops, and other connected technology used by a political
candidate and campaigns. Each application, device, and network
used by this group offers threat actors a potential attack surface.
Likewise, like the general electorate, many policymakers and
their staff are active on social media. Adversaries can collect
considerable information from users’ posts to help them tailor an
effective attack strategy. General information people volunteer
about themselves online may not seem potentially harmful, but it
can be in the hands of trained threat actors.
For example, people post information on how busy, tired, or
overwhelmed they feel. Threat actors can use this information
to time their attack, knowing fatigued people are more prone to
make mistakes. Users discuss issues, topics, and events that
interest them. Adversaries can use this information to send
targeted emails aligning with these interests to increase the
likelihood users will interact with them. The amount of actionable
information threat actors can access on social media pages is
considerable, and includes62:

0

Video blogs revealing building layouts, equipment, team
processes, secure areas, and whiteboard plans

0

Team pictures revealing the hierarchy, membership, and
interests of people within an organization, and often,
their location

0

Common complaints, concerns, or disputes in an organization
that can later be used as a lure in a phishing email

Policymakers and their teams are vulnerable targets for having
their social media accounts mined for exploitable information.
While not as dramatic as blatantly switching votes in an election,
compromised political parties and operatives can represent a real
danger to election security.
Email is another weak point for election security. The Domainbased Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
(DMARC)63 standard is used to verify that an email came from a
specific sender. Email verification is an important tool for fighting
election-year misinformation, yet only 15% of campaigns and PACS

Only

the largest voting counties in the U.S. were vulnerable to phishing
attacks and forged emails.

What Can Be Done?
Election security can be improved by modifying personal behaviors,
and wisely implementing effective technical countermeasures.
Users can improve election security by limiting the information
they share on social media and interacting with others only through
known and trusted channels. For example, communicating with
a government organization through their official website is more
secure than responding to random emails allegedly coming from
them. Users can also practice good security hygiene with work
and personal devices while limiting the amount of technology with
access to sensitive information.
Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a strong role in verifying
user identities. Behavioral analysis, facial recognition, location
analysis, and biometric monitoring all offer AI actionable data sets
for validating user identity. AI can perform simple, less intrusive
functions to prevent voter fraud like authenticating signatures65. It
can also play a role protecting elections from foreign interference
on the Internet, when used by organizations to identify and restrict
disinformation campaigns66.

BAHAMUT is an active threat group investigated extensively by BlackBerry threat researchers in 202067.
The threat group traffics in fake news sites, personas, and social media accounts. They also had dozens
of malicious apps hosted on the App Store™ and Google Play™ store. BAHAMUT is known to researchers
worldwide under many names, including HDEVEL, WINDSHIFT, URPAGE, and THE WHITE COMPANY.
During their investigation, BlackBerry researchers observed BAHAMUT operations against government
officials and industry leaders in India, the Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Advocates for Sikh separatism and
organizations supporting human rights causes in the Middle East also suffered attacks from BAHAMUT.
The threat group has demonstrated zero-day threat capabilities, indicating it has access to at least one
zero-day developer. One particular zero-day exploit targeted InPage, a word processor popular in Urdu,
Arabic, Persian-speaking countries, and the major newspapers in Pakistan and India.
BAHAMUT works hard to cover its tracks, ensuring its activities remain difficult to detect or attribute. It
uses tools created by other threat groups (or publicly available alternatives) and keeps its campaigns,
network infrastructure, and phishing tools separated. BAHAMUT may obscure its activity by imitating the
same TTPs popularized by other threat groups. Backdoors and exploit shellcode written by BAHAMUT

targeted individuals associated with the political, economic, and
social sectors in the Middle East. These early targets included:

BlackBerry research shows that South Asia and the Persian Gulf
are the two regions most at-risk from current BAHAMUT activity.
The group’s phishing infrastructure remains focused on credential
harvesting from popular sites like Google™, Microsoft®, Yahoo!®, and

observed the group selecting targets in South Asia, particularly in
India and Pakistan. Some researchers report witnessing BAHAMUT
activity in China and northern and eastern Europe as well. These
cases show the threat group’s tendency to target individuals
rather than organizations. The Bellingcat documents suggest that
BAHAMUT may act as a hacker-for-hire operation, given the vast
diversity of specific targets.

BAHAMUT’s targeting is all over the map, which makes it difficult to
concoct a single victimology. BAHAMUT appears to be not only wellfunded and well-resourced, but also well-versed in security research
and the cognitive biases analysts often possess.

EMOTET: THE EVOLVING THREAT
Emotet is an evolving threat that has been terrorizing systems since 201468. The
earliest versions of Emotet functioned as a banking trojan, performing man-inthe-browser attacks to steal credentials69. These early versions focused on
targets in Germany and Austria and featured malicious attachments created
to look like invoices or other financial documents70. Following its appearance
and a few months of malicious activity, Emotet attacks declined until an
updated variant emerged in 201571. Emotet is designed to avoid attacking
Russian-speaking countries72, which leads many researchers to believe it
originates from Russia.

EMOTET: THE EVOLVING THREAT
Regular Updates

Emotet in 2020

Emotet has received numerous updates over the years from
a highly capable team of threat actors. These changes include
the ability to detect virtual machines, transfer funds directly to
attackers, deploy anti-analysis techniques, and incorporate a
Windows API component73. In 2017, Emotet transitioned to a more
open and modular threat74 and the main banking-based module
was removed. By 2018, the United States Computer Emergency
Readiness Team (US-CERT) recognized Emotet as “…among the
most costly and destructive malware affecting SLTT (state, local,
tribal, and territorial) governments”75.

The threat actors behind Emotet have taken periodic breaks from
activity since the threat first emerged in 2014. In 2020, Emotet
entered a period of inactivity ranging from February 7th to July
17th79 before resuming in September. The 2020 version of Emotet
arrived with two notable new capabilities and one unexpected flaw.

Major updates had occurred to Emotet by 2019, making it an
advanced attack platform capable of delivering other threats like
Trickbot and Ryuk76. This multi-year transformation from banking
trojan to global botnet allowed the threat actors behind Emotet to
monetize it as malware-as-a-service77. Emotet became the primary
distributor of botnet delivered payloads, accounting for 61% of total
malicious payloads by March 201978.

The first noteworthy Emotet update allows the malware to perform
Wi-Fi brute force attacks and device infection80. Previously, Emotet
spread through two attack vectors, malspam and infected networks.
With the Wi-Fi brute force upgrade, Emotet can propagate through
insecure wireless networks and connected devices. While this new
capability was not discovered until January 2020, the timestamp
on the Wi-Fi spreading binary is set to April 16, 2018.

Emotet infection has a unique file hash ID. This effectively counters
blacklisting, as no two infections will be identical, and previously
discovered Emotet loaders can easily be updated with new IDs.
The 2020 Emotet update also contained some good news for threat
researchers, a design flaw that functioned as a kill-switch for the
malware. The same mechanism used by Emotet to implement
hash-busting was repurposed by threat researchers to stop the
malware from running. Researchers, using the random file name
generation function of Emotet could reset the malware’s filename
to “.exe”, causing it to malfunction81. This tactic protected systems
from Emotet infections from February 6, 2020 until August 6, 2020,
when a new malware patch was released.

The second Emotet upgrade implements a tactic called hashbusting that acts as a countermeasure to malware identification
and blacklisting. In the past, the Emotet loader could be identified by
its unique file hash and preemptively shut down. Using hash-busting,
in this case by adding 64 bytes of random data to the loader, each

CONNECTED VEHICLES

Connected vehicles, which can contain over 100 independently developed
components, are difficult to secure due to the multiple vendors involved in
their assembly82. The sheer number of international entities participating in
the automotive supply chain make enforcing common cybersecurity criterion
extremely challenging.
Modern vehicles rely on multiple on-board computers to perform everything
from critical system functions to navigation and entertainment. These
advancements force car manufacturers to become experts in integrating and
developing software83. Vehicles are increasingly connecting to the Internet as
well, with an estimated 280 million on-road automobiles currently Internetconnected84. These factors set the stage for a crisis, automobiles becoming
increasingly interconnected while auto manufacturers scramble to find ways
to secure vehicle systems85.

Until effective cybersecurity protocols and
procedures are incorporated into the design and
manufacture of vehicles, modern automobiles are
effectively insecure networks.

Common Connected Vehicle Vulnerabilities

The United Nations Gets Involved

Connected vehicles are susceptible to cyber attacks ranging from
simple data theft to highly advanced system hijacking. Some
common vulnerabilities and attack vectors include:

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)
approved vehicle cybersecurity regulation WP.29 on June 25, 202093.
This regulation outlines cybersecurity processes and measures
that automobile manufacturers must meet to achieve vehicle type
approval from UNECE. The UNECE standards apply to “contracting
parties”, which includes many E.U. countries, China, Japan, and
Korea94. The new standards require automakers to95:

Hijacking electronic control units (ECU) to disrupt braking,
steering, and engine operation86

Vehicle vulnerability related to previous owners/renters91

Make efforts to manage vehicle cyber risks
Detect and respond to cybersecurity events across vehicle fleets
Design systems to be secure throughout the supply and
value chains
Provide secure software updates to on-board systems for the
lifetime of the vehicle

Vehicles that do not comply with these guidelines will not be
approved for sale by UNECE.
The WP.29 regulations do not instruct automakers on how to
implement cybersecurity into their processes. This means auto
makers and OEM manufacturers will have to work together to
find ways to comply with the regulation. Major industry players
are working closely with the standards organization to develop
cybersecurity standards, ISO 21434, which takes WP.29 regulations
to an implementation level. While it is encouraging to see the auto
industry embracing cybersecurity, the requirement for WP.29compliant vehicles will not be enforced until July 202496. This delay
leaves threat actors years to operate in the largely unregulated and
insecure space of connected vehicles.

Reliance on network connectivity for functionality92

Securing vehicles from cyber threats becomes increasingly difficult
with every additional network connection, electronic component,
and software-driven system. Until effective cybersecurity protocols
and procedures are incorporated into the design and manufacture
of vehicles, modern automobiles are effectively insecure networks.

MOBILE OVERLAY ATTACK LIFECYCLE

Social engineering continues to be a highly effective means for stealing
payment and access information. Presented within the context of an installed
application, a prompt for credit card or passwords using a well-designed
form often yields success for attackers. This trick works especially well when
timed to coincide with application launch.
The theory is simple: present a credential or payment request at a time when
the user is interacting with a target application. The prompt doesn’t seem out
of place or unexpected. The user dutifully enters the information because
they believe it’s necessary for the application to function correctly. Re-entering
payment details into your favorite ride-sharing app, as it loads, when you’re
late for a meeting clearly plays to the attackers’ advantage.

CYBERSECURITY INSIGHTS

MOBILE OVERLAY ATTACK LIFECYCLE

Monitoring the foreground window against a list of targets is made
possible through different methods. The most common and batteryfriendly is via functions provided by the Accessibility Service (AS).
The AS is a native function of Android designed to assist users
with visual, hearing, and other related disabilities. A related method
for timing an overlay attack leverages the foreground time or last
used counters provided by the Android UsageStats service. While
less battery-friendly, owing to the need to poll, this alternative
approach still gives sufficient resolution to pop-up a request to an
unsuspecting user. The Mysterybot information stealer employed
this technique in 2018.
A prerequisite to using features of the AS is the B I N D _
ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission, which, in addition to
a long list of other malware-helpful features, allows an application
to listen for changes in the foreground activity. When a foreground
transition occurs, the malware is notified, and the package name
of the new activity is queried against an internal list. If a match is
found, the malicious overlay is shown to the user.

1

The accessibility service can permit an application to interact with
activity controls (clicking buttons, entering text into fields, etc.). If a
malicious application requires additional permissions, it can submit
a request to the OS and then automatically click the OK button
on-screen. This process occurs without any user involvement.
Information gathering overlays are composed of web content: a
mix of HTML and/or JavaScript, rendered in a top-most WebClient
window in front of the target application. The Android WebView
class provides the necessary functions: “A WebView is useful when
you need increased control over the UI and advanced configuration
options that will allow you to embed web pages in a speciallydesigned environment for your app.”
In-the-wild families that have, or continue to use overlay attacks,
center most heavily around banking and information stealing
malware: Anubis, Ginp, Cerberus, EventBot, and Marcher. Bank
authentication details or payment card information for several apps
specific to different countries is featured prominently amongst the
activities of the Android malware community.

Hijack Accessibility Service (AS)
and leverage usage stats to figure
out an optimal attack time

Google has announced forthcoming changes to the AS in Android
10 (“Q”), specifically deprecating the overlay feature. In addition,
permissions for the AS will be automatically revoked after 30
seconds. While these changes are welcome, it’s unlikely to have
any impact on existing handsets that manufacturers have forgotten.
Refusing to back-port security fixes entices users into upgrading.
The most effective means of defending against overlay attacks is to:

THE YEAR IN RANSOMWARE
BlackBerry research has identified several notable ransomware threat trends in 2020, including:

A distinct shift from widespread, indiscriminate distribution to highly
targeted campaigns often deployed via compromised managed
security service providers (MSSPs)97.

Increased collaboration and information sharing between
ransomware threat actors and other threat groups, like those behind
Emotet, Trickbot, and Azorult.

Ryuk collaboration with Trickbot and Emotet. This triple threat
executes with Emotet dropping Trickbot on the host system
to steal data. Trickbot then downloads Ryuk to perform
ransomware operations.

RaaS shifting to a more private model, where access to vetted
affiliates is granted in exchange for sensitive information or for
an agreed cut from the proceedings. Access could include an
established foothold to compromised MSSPs, corporate networks,
and/or government networks.

Exfiltration of data prior to, or during, the ransomware encryption
process. This enables attackers to blackmail victims with the threat
of exposing their sensitive data on public forums should they fail
to pay the ransom in a timely manner. Additionally, General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe requires companies to
report any data breach. This can pressure companies to decide
between paying a hefty regulatory fee or the ransom.

Zeppelin collaboration with Azorult. Zeppelin ransomware can
encrypt a system and install Azorult spyware to steal credentials,
files, and other data.

The pandemic dramatically changed corporate working culture.
Users shifted to working from home. Businesses had to scale
up services to support operations and collaborations across

Remote working presented an opportunity for cyber criminals
to exploit the new workplace reality with phishing attacks.
Data from the Anti-Phishing Working Group showed that
the number of phishing campaigns has grown since March

business email compromise attack is estimated to be $48,000
in Q3 2020.

A particularly interesting technique that drew BlackBerry
researchers’ attention was the use of trojanized applications
to steal 0auth access tokens. Dubbed consent phishing,

and discovered in the wild in December 2019100, these
campaigns provide an attacker a means to bypass multifactor
authentication (MFA). Threat actors first trick users into
providing permissions to a malicious application. The
application then accesses the user’s cloud data without using
their username and password101 102 103. This technique allows
attackers to bypass traditional credential phishing defences
and malware signatures.

DEEPFAKE THREAT ACTIVITY
One of the first cases of deepfake weaponization in the workplace was discovered last year. A senior
official was tricked into transferring money after he received a call from a fraudster who impersonated
the CEO’s voice using deepfakes104. This year, COVID-19 forced the corporate world to quickly pivot
to providing secure remote connectivity for their workforce. As a result, cyber criminals rushed to
weaponize deepfakes within the corporate world. In addition, primitive misinformation techniques like
GIFs, photoshops, and face swaps continue to provide a simple and effective way for malicious actors
to deceive users.
Findings this past year showed that a majority of deepfake
activities were found within the entertainment industry in the form
of non-consensual adult media105. Researchers also discovered
several underground forums selling deepfake services with more
actors seeking ways to monetize this technology106. Perhaps one
of the most publicized weaponizations of this technology was
centered around supporting disinformation campaigns. In April
2020, a deepfake video of the Belgian Prime Minister linking the
cause of the pandemic to environmental damage was released107.

In August 2020, Facebook removed 1,500 ads and 900 pages related
to a site called Peace Data that promoted conspiracy theories
to influence U.S. voters. Some editors of this site had deepfake
profile pictures108.
The bulk of attacks this year have largely focused on phishing,
ransomware, hacking, etc. As normalcy returns around the world,
threat actors may look towards increasing the weaponization of
deepfake technology in the workplace, especially around facilitating
sextortion campaigns.

resolve include:

Several states, including Washington, Maryland, Texas, and North
Dakota, may follow California, Nevada, and Maine’s leads and enact
data protection laws in 2021. Most state privacy laws — and the
bills nearing passage — give consumers greater control over the
use of their personal information. The CCPA, for example, gives
consumers the right to opt-out of certain data collection and to
delete personal information collected, with some exceptions.

Enforcement: Democrats generally favor a private right of
action, pursuant to which an individual could bring a suit (either
individually, as part of a class action, or via a state attorney
general), to hold technology companies accountable on data
protection. Republicans prefer enforcement by a federal
agency and state attorney general, because companies could
go bankrupt fighting non-meritorious claims.

Federal pre-emption: Republicans in Congress have generally
supported a federal law that pre-empts state laws; they want to
pre-empt state laws such as the California Consumer Privacy
Act (CCPA). Their concern is there could be a patchwork
of state laws and a new federal law with which companies
must comply. Democrats, especially many in California, not
surprisingly oppose federal pre-emption of state laws like the
CCPA. They argue states should be able to raise the bar on

On June 20, 2019, millions of Canadians with accounts in the Desjardins Credit Union (the largest in

included names, addresses, birthdates, social insurance numbers, email address, and information
about transaction habits. At the time, the Desjardins Group indicated that the breach affected around 2.7
million people110 and 173,000 businesses. Fast-forward to December 14, 2020, the Office of the Privacy
Commissioner of Canada (OPC) updated the number affected in a detailed report111.
The breach actually impacted nearly 9.7 million Canadians, a quarter of Canada’s entire population. The
OPC report112 found Desjardins “did not demonstrate the appropriate level of attention required to protect
the sensitive personal information entrusted to its care”. The Privacy Commissioner called out Desjardins
for failing to put in place adequate security measures to prevent this breach. The data compromise
occurred over more than a two-year period before Desjardins even became aware of it.
The increasing scale, scope, and impact of privacy breaches, combined with reliance on digital technologies
in today’s data-driven economy, has ushered in a new era for cybersecurity and privacy legislation.
Canada is set to modernize its aging privacy protection framework for both private and public sector

cause distress to critical infrastructure

Enable data portability and interoperability
Provide Canadians with the ability to demand that their

The legislation also proposes to give the OPC broad powers,
including the ability to force compliance from an organization. If
adopted, Canada will have privacy legislation with teeth that forces
companies to enact organizational and cybersecurity measures
that adequately safeguard personal information. Accompanying
this legislation will be the modernization of the public sector privacy
law, the Privacy Act114. This law, which has not been updated
since 1983, is expected to mirror the proposed Consumer Privacy

Overall, 2021 is likely to see massive investments in cybersecurity
infrastructure, technologies, and relevant legislation made by

Securing Remote Infrastructure and Mobile Technology
Cybersecurity risks skyrocketed when COVID-19 forced workers
to transition to home offices and children to remote learning
environments123. By March 2020, coronavirus-themed campaigns
and attacks were well underway124. These attacks began so
quickly at the beginning of the outbreak that the World Health
Organization released a statement warning of imposters using
the organization’s name125.

The steps seem simple, but each device, software app, and location
added to the infrastructure exponentially increases its complexity.
An estimated ten-fold increase126 in work from home employees also
represents an increase of routers, smartphones, mobile devices,
and personal PCs handling company data. This puts companies in
the difficult position of no longer having to worry about the security
of one network, but thousands.

Today, organizations have had roughly a year to adapt to changes
caused by COVID-19. By now, businesses should be transitioning
from their initial emergency response measures to a permanent
long-term strategy for incorporating remote workers. A successful
plan for accommodating remote and mobile workers should include:

VPNs felt an enormous strain as some vendors reported usage
increases of 165% in a month127. Increased VPN usage from remote
workers introduces new security risks, as all protected data is
funneled to a single location, the provider’s company. Incorrectly
configured and/or vulnerable VPNs can expose remote employees
who believe themselves secure to potential cyber attacks128.

The Zero Trust Solution
Zero Trust, as the name implies, is a security model where everything
inside or outside an organization is initially treated as a threat.
Nothing is granted access to organizational resources until it builds
(and maintains) trust. The Zero Trust philosophy is attributed to
John Kindervag, a former principal analyst at Forrester Research
Inc., who coined the term in 2010129. This framework solves the
problem of securing every location and device used by remote
employees by assuming they are untrusted by default.
Employees and new devices can connect to business infrastructure,
but until they perform steps establishing their trustworthiness, their
access is safely limited. Trust (and greater access) can be granted
through a series of quick, non-intrusive measures commonly used
today: two-factor authentication, security questions, etc. Once
necessary access is granted, the user and connected device(s) are
continuously monitored to ensure nothing suspicious occurs. The
process sounds like it would be intrusive and resource-intensive,
but AI makes achieving an almost frictionless Zero Trust security
posture possible130.

Ensuring that third-party apps and OEM software on BYOD devices
is secure is another monumental task achievable through a Zero
Trust framework. Work resources are relatively easy to monitor and
protect within the business environment, but what happens when
they are transferred to insecure BYOD devices? Implementing a
secure gateway with IP layer security optimized for mobile and
low-power devices can protect employee browsing and internal
communications. Devices using the gateway can be sheltered from
malicious URLs, dangerous apps, and phishing campaigns.
Disasters, both natural and manmade, inevitably place a heavy
burden upon organizations while creating opportunities for
malicious actors. Businesses, however, do not have to operate at
a perpetual disadvantage. Implementing a Zero Trust framework for
remote workers and BYOD devices can eliminate or reduce many
successful tactics threat actors deploy in times of crisis.

CRITICAL EVENT MANAGEMENT
FOR A SAFE AND SECURE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
As countries tackle the challenge to create smart cities, data collection and protection becomes important
for better managing a municipality’s assets, resources, and services. Public utilities, traffic management
networks, community facilities, and essential services will see improved operations as resources are
optimized. Part of this journey will likely involve cybersecurity incident response teams deployed across
various operational sectors in the economy. These teams will be tasked with detecting, identifying, and
containing potential malicious actions. In most cases, the overall process will require support from
private sector stakeholders and impact the lives of businesses, communities, and people.
In an ideal world, current defense measures, levels of expertise,
systems, and IoT device integration would provide sufficient
response capabilities. With today’s research, and surveillance
systems installed across various countries, we may one day
accurately predict when (and where) the next natural disaster may
occur. This would allow effective response and mitigation assets to
be deployed in advance while allowing critical data to remain secure.
However, the reality is the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario,
described as a “gray swan” by risk and resilience practitioners, may
occur again in the future. If so, the planning parameters affecting
the deployment of public safety and security assets will continue
to challenge society. Disruptive critical events often affect every
individual while creating opportunities for threat actors. Attackers

exploit times of catastrophe to gain access to critical information on
personal mobile devices, or worse, in enterprise critical systems131.
To illustrate, most buildings and critical infrastructure are managed

regulate airflow, monitor air quality, lighting, water, and electricity,
as well as security and fire protection systems. Cyber attacks on
building facilities in recent years have been on the rise and can create

communication systems are compromised, there is an urgent need
to ensure critical communications can continue in a secured and
reliable environment. When an unexpected event puts lives at risk,
it is crucial to be able to:

0
0
0
0

Rapidly notify relevant parties
Locate and account for missing people and critical resources
Collect real-time on-the-ground information
Facilitate the coordination of stakeholders to manage and
contain the crisis

The ability to provide an alternative, rapid means of communication
is a prudent investment decision. Especially for times when a
cybersecurity threat is detected early by the security operations
center. Prepared response playbooks can be pre-populated into
critical event management platforms. This way, when a significant
threat is detected, critical information can be delivered via multiple
platforms and integrations (for example, through common platforms
such as ServiceNow and Microsoft Teams). Automated response
playbooks could also support live operations management and
even facilitate forward planning activities.
Current legacy operating systems and devices remain a potential
point of entry for threat actors. Businesses or communities that
have yet to harness the potential of smart cities are particularly
vulnerable. Outdated systems and malicious attackers can greatly
hinder attempts to facilitate swift critical event management during
a potential crisis. A robust critical event management platform
that supports stakeholder collaboration and provides situational
awareness can effectively enhance crisis management operations
and protect communities and businesses.

CYBERSECURITY INSIGHTS

THREAT TRENDS TO WATCH IN 2021
BlackBerry researchers and security professionals were asked to provide
their cybersecurity predictions for the upcoming year. They ask users to stay
aware of the following threat trends as 2021 progresses.
Ransomware Attacks Will Continue to Leverage the Double
Extortion Strategy

Threat Actors Contacting Patients as
Part of Healthcare Extortion Strategies

Threat actors will continue to conduct ransomware attacks while utilizing double extortion
to pressure a victim to pay ransom this year. Throughout 2020, cyber criminals strategically
stole the victim’s data before encrypting it, then threatened to release the stolen information
to the public, or even to a competitor. This tactic is used to compel the victim to pay (or at
least engage with) the attackers to recover their data. The strategy has driven up the average
ransom payments throughout 2020, even though there are no guarantees that attacker-owned
copies of the victim’s data will be deleted. Instances have been discovered where attackers
still released the victim’s data even after receiving the ransom payment133 134.

Throughout 2020, healthcare organizations continued to top the target list of cyber attacks.
The healthcare industry is critical for providing services during the pandemic and also
holds confidential data like medical records, which are extremely valuable to attackers.
Threat researchers saw cases where medical records were weaponized to facilitate the
attacker’s objectives.

Nation-State Actors Hiding Behind Crimeware-as-a-Service
The emergence, sophistication, and anonymity of crimeware-as-a-service means that nation
states can mask their efforts behind third-party contractors and an almost impenetrable wall
of plausible deniability. Attackers can obfuscate their efforts to make it appear as though
an attack originated almost anywhere. This makes decisively attributing cyber attacks to
known threat actors extremely difficult. Companies should consider adapting by applying
Zero Trust networking principles and role-based access controls, not just to users, but also
to applications and servers.

In October 2020, a Finnish psychotherapy center had their systems attacked and patient data
stolen. Not only did the attackers demand a ransom from the psychotherapy center, they
also contacted patients individually seeking a ransom of 200 Euros in bitcoin. The threat
actors ultimately published the records of at least 300 patients via a Tor site135. This tactic
could become more popular throughout 2021, especially when combined with traditional
ransomware attacks. Furthermore, it could also provide additional pressure on healthcare
service providers from patients who are being extorted individually, leading to a higher
probability of ransom payment.

Crypto Prices Driving Ransomware Growth
It is generally believed that there is a correlation between the rate of ransomware infections and
the price of bitcoin. The value of bitcoin reached all new highs in early 2021136. If this assumed
correlation holds true, a robust ransomware market can be expected in the near future.

46

CONCLUSION

CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 pandemic made a major impact on global systems, and cybersecurity was no exception
to its influence. As businesses struggled to survive the disruptive effects of the coronavirus, threat
actors moved quickly to capitalize on the resulting chaos. Workers connecting from remote locations,
using new devices and untested infrastructure, offered threat actors a rich new attack surface to exploit.
People’s fear of COVID-19 and understandable desire for information gave attackers new opportunities
to launch COVID-19-themed phishing campaigns and malicious apps.
Elections remained vulnerable to cyber attacks through unsecured mobile technology, insufficient DMARC
email protection, and over-exposure of personal information on social media. While electronic voting
machines are often the center of attention in discussions about election security, it seems attackers favor
interfering through more subtle methods. Non-secure political websites, operatives using compromised
technology, and over-sharing of personal information on social media all played a role in weakening
election security in 2020.

47

CONCLUSION

The elusive and highly capable BAHAMUT group remained active
in 2020. They trafficked in fake news sites, social media accounts,
and hosted dozens of malicious apps in the App Store and Google
Play store. BAHAMUT activity currently appears focused in the
South Asia and the Persian Gulf regions, though targets in China and
Europe have also been discovered. Currently, the group is engaged
in credential harvesting from popular sites like Google, Microsoft,
Yahoo!, Telegram, Sina, QQ, 126, and 163.
The threat actors behind Emotet continued to refine their attack
strategies and capabilities. In 2020, the threat was upgraded to
perform Wi-Fi brute force attacks and device infections. It also
implemented hash-busting to prevent blacklisting and other security
countermeasures. A vulnerability discovered in the malware
briefly allowed threat researchers to trigger a kill switch on Emotet
infections. The flaw has since been patched.
Ransomware attacks shifted from performing indiscriminate
targeting to conducting highly focused campaigns deployed via
compromised MSSPs. RaaS is increasingly adopting a private
model where affiliates are given access to compromised systems
for an agreed cut of future profits. Attackers are favoring exfiltrating
data before encryption, then using it to blackmail victims for
higher ransoms.

Vehicle manufacturers, facing new regulations, are becoming more
cybersecurity conscious. However, connected vehicles remain
largely unprotected against a wide range of cyber attacks and data
theft. In 2020, the UNECE approved vehicle cybersecurity regulation
WP.29 which begins the work of setting common security criterion
for global automakers. The first vehicles to benefit from improved
security regulations should be on the road by Summer 2024.
The cybersecurity field becomes increasingly complex with each
passing year as new technologies, devices, and innovations enter
the space. However, the foundation for robust security practices
remains unchanged – prepare, prevent, detect, and respond.
BlackBerry has delivered secure communications and technology
for decades by developing advanced solutions that align with sound
security principles. Today, our fifth-generation AI-driven solutions
can detect zero-day malware, fileless attacks, insider threats, and
more by following the same time-tested security fundamentals.
BlackBerry remains dedicated to advancing the cause of
cybersecurity for people and organizations worldwide. We continue
to train and deploy increasingly effective and advanced AI models
that power our endpoint protection products, with the aim of
securing technology, processes, and user identity. We continuously
monitor the global threat landscape for emerging threats and seek
to provide solutions where problems arise. To learn more about how
BlackBerry can secure your technology in 2021 and beyond, visit us at

Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)) compromised certain
SolarWinds software widely used across private/public to monitor health of cyber
networks. CISA had to issue an emergency cybersecurity directive ordering all
federal agencies to disconnect or power-down certain SolarWind products.
