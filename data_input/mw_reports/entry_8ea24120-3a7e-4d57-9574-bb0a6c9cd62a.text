Based on files uploaded to the VirusTotal scanning service, the ransomware attack on the
City of New Orleans was likely done by the Ryuk Ransomware threat actors.
On December 14th, 2019, one day after the City of New Orleans ransomware attack, what
appear to be memory dumps of suspicious executables were uploaded from an IP address
from the USA to the VirusTotal scanning service.
One of these memory dumps, which contained numerous references to New Orleans and
Ryuk, was later found by Colin Cowie of Red Flare Security and shared with
BleepingComputer.com.

As memory dumps are a snapshot of the memory being used by an application while it is
running, it can be used to extract useful strings, file names, commands, and other
information that the executable interacted with or executed. This allows memory dumps to
be used during cyber attack forensic investigations to learn more about how the attack was
conducted.
The memory dump found by Cowie is for an executable named 'yoletby.exe' and contains
numerous references to the City of New Orleans including domain names, domain
controllers, internal IP addresses, user names, file shares, and references to the Ryuk
ransomware.
The Ryuk ransomware strings included in the dump were the HERMES file marker, file
names ending with the .ryk extension, and references to the created RyukReadMe.html
ransom notes.

Ryuk

and City of New Orleans strings
After investigating the file further, BleepingComputer found an interesting reference to the
C:\Temp\v2.exe executable that was executed on the machine. It turns out that a memory
dump for this file was also uploaded to VirusTotal.

v2.exe strings

Of particular interest in the v2.exe memory dump is a string that refers to the New Orleans
City Hall.
After further digging around, BleepingComputer was able to find a v2.exe executable, and
after executing it, was able to confirm that it was the Ryuk ransomware.

Files encrypted by Ryuk after executing v2.exe
While it is not known if this executable is the one used in the City of New Orleans attack, it
does show that this filename is used in Ryuk attacks and the memory dumps show that a
file of that name was used on an attack against the City of New Orleans.
If the City of New Orleans was indeed encrypted by Ryuk, which by the evidence seems
likely, then this is just another victim of Ryuk who has seen increased activity lately.
BleepingComputer has contacted the City of New Orleans for confirmation that they were
infected with Ryuk, but have not heard back at this time.

Emotet and Trickbot likely present as well
If New Orleans was encrypted by Ryuk, there is also a very high chance that the Emotet
and TrickBot infections are present on the network as well
Emotet is a malware infection that is commonly spread through spam emails that contain
malicious attachments. When opened and macros enabled, these attachments will install
the Emotet Trojan on the victim's computer.
Emotet will then use that infected computer to spam other computers with malicious
attachments and also download further malware on the computer.

4/7

One of the most common malware installed by Emotet is the TrickBot information-stealing
Trojan.
When executed, TrickBot will connect back to a command and control server where it will
receive commands to load various modules that steal information from the computer or
install even further malware.
After the TrickBot actors collect all valuable information and data from the computer, it will
then open a reverse shell back to the Ryuk actors.
From there, the Ryuk team will perform reconnaissance of the network, collect admin
passwords, take over domain controllers, and utilize post-exploitation toolkits such as
PowerShell Empire.
This is why all network admins need to realize that if they have been encrypted by Ryuk,
there has commonly been a malware presence on their network for quite a while and that
other data may have been stolen or compromised.

What does this mean for the City of New Orleans?
It means that in addition to the Ryuk Ransomware infection, they also have to deal with the
fact that attackers have been snooping around their data for some time.
The city will need to be more diligent against targeted phishing attacks, tighten security on
their network, and change passwords.
Also, as it is unknown what financial information may have been attained by the attackers,
the City of New Orleans should contact their banking partners and put new procedures in
place regarding how money is transferred.
Update 12/15/19: Updated article to include how Emotet and Trickbot are usually found
with Ryuk infections. Thx @vagab0ndsec and @QW5kcmV3.

Hello i want to know if this is actually caused by Ryuk or also how did you even
analyze it ?
Also those dumps you used to analyze belongs to the victim computer of new

Files uploaded to VirusTotal are shared with all users unless they are marked private
by the uploader. This allows many security researchers to download and analyze
actual malware in the wild. Many times these uploads contain indications of their
origin. The ones in the article appear to contain domain information that indicate the
origin of the files was New Orleans.

Yes, the memory dumps clearly indicate that the processes were running on the City
of New Orleans domain
