Since October 2019, 360 Security Center has successively intercepted multiple cyber attacks
against foreign trade, transportation, and several important maritime ports. Through a joint
analysis of these attack incidents, we find that the hacker team that launched the attack is
highly professional and has a powerful arsenal. The targets of the attack are of extremely
high value, so we don’t think this is purely personal behavior, But a professional hacker team
or APT organization.
When analyzing the organization’s CVE-2017-11882 exploit document, we found that the
way to bypass the shellcode length limitation is similar to that used by the APT organization
TA505, but the delivered payload is in favor of publicly sold malware such as NanoCore ,
Formbook, etc., did not find any Tema ever used by TA505. So we are not sure if this attack
was initiated by TA505.

However, in order to facilitate the continuous follow-up of the organization, we named the
attack “Bayworld”, and we will continue to track and study more attacks related to the
organization.
Attack target
We analyzed the machines that infected a series of Trojan horses and found that the main
attack targets of BayWorld activities were concentrated in large enterprises with import and
export business, covering medical, chemical, construction, and various new manufacturing
industries. Major regional transport companies, as well as a number of important maritime
ports launched attacks.
The attack area is mainly distributed in China, Egypt, Ukraine and other countries. The main
attack targets are the Suez Canal, Algiers Port, Youzny Sea Port and other important
commercial ports. The regional distribution is shown in the following figure:

Decoy document
We analyzed the phishing emails related to Bayworld activities from August 2019. The
malicious document attachments carried in the emails are mainly divided into the following
three categories:
1. Contains macro viruses
2. Contains CVE-2017-8570 vulnerability
3. Contains CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability

The contents of the phishing emails are relatively simple. After the embarrassment, the
victims will be reminded to open the attached file:

Attachments are usually disguised as purchase orders, payment vouchers, account
statements, etc.

CVE-2017-11882
Unlike most previous CVE-2017-11882 exploits, Bayworld uses malicious code in xlsx files.
When overflowing, it uses a 30-byte shellcode to dynamically obtain the memory pointer of
the MTEFData structure and locate the remaining shellcode. In order to bypass the limit on
the length of shellcode when exploiting.

This method is not the first time to appear. We found that a similar use method was
mentioned in the analysis report of the TA505 hacker organization by friends and merchants,
but based on one point, we are not sure that the Bayworld was initiated by the TA505 hacker
organization.

CVE-2017-8570
The CVE-2017-8570 exploit document contains two key ole objects. The first is a Package
type malicious scriptletfile (SCT) script. After the malicious document is opened, the Package
object is automatically released to the% temp% directory.

The second is an OLE2Link object, which is used to trigger the SCT script released to a
random directory

The SCT script is used to download subsequent payloads.

Malicious macro
In addition to exploiting vulnerabilities, a large number of macro viruses have also been used
in Bayworld activities. The macro code has been obfuscated. After multiple decryptions, it will
call powershell to execute the following script:

Add C # code to the current session via Add-Type and execute:

Then bypass AMSI detection through Patch AmsiScanBuffer, and finally download and
execute the payload.
PayLoad
During our analysis of the activities of BayWorld, we found that there are many types of
payloads delivered by them, covering the following types of mainstream remote control and
spyware.

In addition, I also detected a small amount of malware from families such as Ave_Maria and
NjRat. These malware have powerful functions, and hackers can control the victim’s machine
and perform any desired operation through this software.
Covert means
In addition to using IP addresses in some URLs, most of them use dynamic domain names
to hide real server addresses:

Summary
Bayworld is a well-targeted and highly professional cyber attack campaign. The hacking
gang behind it has a powerful arsenal and diverse attack methods. It uses a large number of
obfuscated codes and dynamic domain names in the entire attack process. At the same
time, its own characteristics are well hidden.
360 Total Security can intercept such cyber attacks in multiple dimensions. Users could
install and use it:
