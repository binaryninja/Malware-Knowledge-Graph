IT SECURIT Y STATUS REPORT 2011 | Preface

Preface
The opportunities offered by present-day IT in both our private and professional lives
are many and varied. Just as many and varied, however, are the risks we face as we increasingly shift our business transactions and social interaction into the virtual world.

For attackers also keep tabs on developments and are constantly working out sophisticated ways of staying one step ahead of their potential victims. Authors of malware are
using ever more diverse technical measures to make their programs harder to detect or
analyze. For example, there is malware out there that can scan its target system to pick
up on features of an analysis environment. If it detects any, it will stop trying to infect

the system. This makes it harder for specialists to analyze the program. It also increases
the demands on users; it is becoming more crucial for them to play an active role than
ever before. There is need to be every bit as alert and curious in the online lives as there
is in the offline world.

Internet criminals have long since created a market for their services which helps to
increase their “earning potential”. A botnet consisting of 10,000 bot PCs, for example,
can be rented for around US$ 200 a day. And as botnets can consist of several millions
of PCs, the financial potential of such attacks is something we can only guess at.

But we will not allow this to discourage us: on the upside there have been plenty of
successes. Like the dismantling of large-scale botnets, for example. Often this is achieved
through the joint efforts of many companies, IT security organizations and investigators all over the world. This worldwide network is constantly expanding. April 1 saw
the opening of the National Cyber Defense Center, a joint venture of German federal
security departments operating under the auspices of the BSI, tasked with defending
critical federal government and industrial IT infrastructures against electronic attacks.

My employees and I are doing our bit to make the online world safer for all of us. And
this is something we are fully committed to.

Drive-by Exploits

Drive-by Exploits
Drive-by exploits automatically exploit vulnerabilities in software
on a PC without user interaction. When a user visits a website
containing a drive-by, it can exploit vulnerabilities in the browser,
in browser plug-ins or in the operating system to install malware
such as trojan horses on the PC without the user's knowledge.

12

IT SECURIT Y STATUS REPORT 2011 | Drive-By Explotis

Over the past few months, attackers have focused their
attention primarily on weaknesses in older versions of
the widely used software products Adobe Reader and
Flash and in the Java Runtime Environment. However,
exploit kits are also still successful at exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and the Windows Operating
System, many of which have been around for years, since
many users have not yet installed the security updates
that fix these vulnerabilities.

It gets particularly critical when the attackers use zeroday exploits that target vulnerable software for which
the vendor has not yet issued a security update.

Summary:
It is not usually possible for a visitor to a website to tell
whether it has been manipulated and leads to drive-by
exploits. The exploitation of vulnerabilities and installation of malware on the PC goes undetected and without
any additional user interaction. To protect against infection, it is therefore vital to install all available security
updates for operating systems and applications as soon
as they become available. Because of the large number
of malware variants being distributed every day, an antivirus software alone will not offer sufficient protection.

Botnets

Botnets
A botnet is a network of infected PCs that are controlled remotely
by an attacker. Botnets are used for the distribution of spam,
spying on keyboard inputs, or attacking other systems like web
servers or entire networks unnoticed by the PC owner. Once a PC
has been infected – by whatever means – and is part of a botnet,
an attacker can abuse it for many different purposes.

make their PCs available for attacks like DDoS on companies. A botnet can also be formed in this way.

Botnet operators can potentially infect an increasing
number of PCs, because more and more users have
broadband internet access and leave their computers
connected to the internet 24/7. As a result, the intensity
of cyber-attacks is also on the rise: according to BSI
estimates, it already exceeds individual providers'
service bandwidths, which can lead to network outages.

Users do not usually notice that their PC is part of a

The risk is diminishing as recipient e-mail infrastructures become overloaded. But the content of criminal spam is becoming ever more convincing. This increases the risks to the recipient, which include fake medication, compulsive gambling,

Identity Theft and Identity Fraud

Identity Theft and Identity Fraud
In IT, the identity of a person is generally defined as a dataset which differentiates this person from others in certain circumstances. The most straightforward example is the username/password combination. Gaining unauthorized access to these data constitutes identity theft, which often goes hand
in hand with identity fraud. The perpetrators’ primary aim is to gain financial
benefit; more rarely, they may be trying to discredit someone.

Stuxnet

Stuxnet
Over the past few months, public attention has focused on the malware Stuxnet, which
was discovered in 2010. This example very clearly illustrates the professional modus
operandi of the attackers and the risks that targeted attacks pose to industrial systems.
Stuxnet is malware with highly complex programming designed to circumvent special
protection mechanisms. This enables them to attack industrial process control systems.
Attacks that have taken place exclusively targeted process control computers running
Siemens’ WinCC SCADA software. This malware was used to sabotage a very specific
system configuration in a highly sophisticated way. Worldwide, manufacturers of antivirus software observed several hundreds of thousands of infections of all kinds of PCs,
all harmless – presumably as a collateral infection. The 22 infections confirmed by
Siemens industrial customers had no impact on their industrial systems. The vulnerabilities
exploited by Stuxnet in the Windows operating system have since been closed.

Domain Name System and Routing

Domain Name System
Users access the internet using services like e-mail or the World Wide Web (WWW). The basis
for the operation of many internet services is the Domain Name System (DNS) service, which
is responsible for name resolution. The DNS translates host names like www.bsi.bund.de into
IP addresses (here, 77.87.228.49). So the user does not have to to deal directly with hard-toremember numerical IP addresses. Host name or DNS integration into virtually all common
internet services makes the Domain Name System one of the most important services on
the internet.

Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a model that enables IT services (Software as a Service, Platform as a
Service, Infrastructure as a Service) to be purchased and paid for fast, on demand on an
online network at any time. The services can either be purchased from a Public Cloud, a Private Cloud or a Hybrid Cloud. In a Public Cloud, IT services are provided by a cloud provider
and can be used by anyone with internet access. Alternatively, users can set up their own
infrastructure and obtain the IT services from their own computer centers (Private Cloud).
In a Private Cloud, all services and the infrastructure are controlled by the institution using
the services offered. A Private Cloud can also be operated by third parties. These services
can be accessed via the intranet or a VPN (Virtual Private Network). A Hybrid Cloud is a
mixed form consisting of a Public Cloud and a Private Cloud.

Smart Grid / Smart Meter

Smart Grid / Smart Meter
Since January 1, 2010, German law has required smart electricity meters to be installed
in all new builds or major renovations that, unlike conventional meters, show the user
the actual energy consumption and usage time. These new electricity meters should
also be able to be read and controlled remotely. To encourage consumers to adopt more
climate-friendly behavior, since the end of 2010 energy companies have also been obliged to offer more flexible energy tariffs based on grid load or time of day. “Smart Grid” is
the term given to the move towards integrated, intelligent supply systems. This mainly
applies to electricity grids, but it can also be applied to energy and water supplies in general. This development is well overdue in terms of electricity supply as there is an urgent
need to manage the growing proportion of locally produced electricity being fed into
the grid. In addition, it will also be important in the medium term to optimize electricity
consumption patterns over time. This cannot be done with the existing hierarchical,
electrophysical interconnected networks. Instead, new networked control technologies
are called for.

Conclusion
As IT penetrates into all areas of our lives and networks become ever
more interconnected, we depend on it operating flawlessly. The BSI and
other security agencies believe that the new hazards arising in parallel
to this development, such as cyber attacks, attacks on mobile devices
and attacks extending beyond conventional IT, represent a new, joint
challenge to politics, industry and society in general.

Offers that provide reactive help to the federal administration, industry
and private individuals are necessary and fulfill an important role. In order to effectively combat the threat potential, we will need to focus even
more strongly on prevention going forward. In order to ensure a basic
level of IT security and anticipate risks in advance as far as possible, it is
becoming increasingly important to formulate security requirements
for products and services and make these transparent to the general
public. The BSI pursues this approach by formulating minimum standards, such as for Cloud Computing. This will create the technical basis
for trusting secure IT and benefiting from its potential. Furthermore,
manufacturer and service provider responsibility is increasingly in the
spotlight.

Improving IT security is a goal that can only be achieved by working together effectively. Success in this area depends on cooperation between
manufacturers, providers, security experts, security officers and, not
least, users, whose awareness plays an important role in implementing
widespread security measures.
