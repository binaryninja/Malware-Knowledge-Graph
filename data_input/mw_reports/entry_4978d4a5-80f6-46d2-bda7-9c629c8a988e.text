Malware and Threat Actors

April 1, 2020

The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak tops all the news, google searches, and social media
alerts for good reason. Globally, we need to stay informed of the latest news with this health
crisis. However, it’s also in the news due to malicious threat actors using COVID-19 as a lure
to trick people into giving up account credentials, or to download malware.
In this blog post, we’re going to discuss the latest ways that we’ve seen threat actors using
the current health crisis in malicious campaigns, and the increase in Internet requests related
to COVID-19 material.

Mass Information
Threat actors often use the latest world events, popular news headlines, holidays etc. as
themes for malware content in order to stay relevant and entice victims to visit malicious
websites or open malicious attachments in email. Given the global reach and urgency of the
current health crisis, it’s not surprising that COVID-19 has become a means for threat actors
to deliver their latest malicious content.
Earlier this month, Brian Krebs reported on the use of fake coronavirus live update style
maps to spread the AzorUlt information stealing trojan. The public is very interested in
staying up to date on where the latest COVID-19 cases are happening around the world. If

we use Cisco Umbrella Investigate to look at the amount of query traffic seen on our
resolvers going to one of these domains hosting a malicious live update map, you can see a
spike in requests to this domain starting on March 11th, and continuing to gain more queries
and maintain a steady flow of requests.

A Surge in New Domains
We have certainly seen a surge in Internet requests to domains that include the word ‘covid’
or ‘corona’ over the past two months. On February 19, our enterprise customers made
562,144 queries to 8,080 unique domains containing these keywords. We saw an increase of
1,907% in requests being made by March 19th, from 11,287,190 requests, across 47,059
domains containing these keywords. 4% of these 47k domains were blocked as malicious
sites.
Below is a list of popular keywords we’ve seen used together with corona, virus, and covid
for new domain registrations:
wuhan
clinics
lab
tests
selftestkit
purchase kits
helpline

Malspam Attacks
Threat actors continue to use email as an infection method, with malicious documents or
embedded malicious links. One approach is disguising the email as coming from the World
Health Organization.
The emails state that the attachment contains important safety measures as directed from
the WHO. These attachments have been seen to be an archive file, pdf, or doc.
Some of the malware threats that we’re tracking associated with COVID-19 scams are
highlighted below.
Kpot
Description: Kpot is an information stealer that steals user data and account credentials. It is
very easily available in various underground forums for a price of around $100 USD.
Nanocore
Description: NanoCore RAT is a Remote Access Trojan which was first spotted in 2013.
Since then, it has been available on the Dark Web. This trojan can be modified by its users
as per their needs. The malware is capable of registry editing, process control, upgrade, file
transfer, keylogging, and password stealing.
Guloader

3/9

Description: GuLoader is a downloader, written partly in VB6, which typically stores its
encrypted payloads on Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive. It is usually distributed as a
portable executable (PE) file that is often observed embedded in a container file such as an
.iso or .rar file. It is used predominantly to download Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and
information stealers such as Agent Tesla, FormBook, NanoCore RAT, Netwire RAT, Remcos
RAT, Ave Maria/Warzone RAT and Parallax RAT.
Trickbot
Description: TrickBot was first seen in 2016 and is a banking trojan with advanced browser
manipulation techniques, server-side injections and redirection techniques. It has most
famously been associated with malspam spread through the Emotet botnet and Trickbot’s
Command and Control servers have been seen as IOCs during investigations of Ryuk
ransomware infections. Trickbot has the ability to steal email credentials and address book
information that is used to send malspam from the affected accounts. In 2020, Trickbot
began to target Active Directory DCs and bypass Windows UAC elevated privlege alerts.
Trickbot can spread laterally through an internal network.
Formbook
Description: Formbook is a trojan information stealer spread through malspam with malicious
document or archive attachments. It was first observed in 2017. It operates with the
Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model making it easy for cyber criminals to operate.
Netwire
Description: NetWire is a remote access trojan (RAT) which is widely used by cybercriminals
since 2012. NetWire has a built-in keylogger that can capture inputs from peripheral devices
such as USB card readers. Other targets include credentials for online accounts and
applications such as email, property management systems (PMS), and internet browsers.
Other sensitive information typed by the user, including Social Security numbers, phone
numbers, addresses, and birthdates can also be compromised. It was used in attacks
against banks and healthcare companies and scammers to remotely control infected
systems.
MetaMorfo
Description: Metamorfo is a banking trojan first seen in April 2018. Metamorfo’s primary
target location at the onset was Brazil. Today, it’s targets have spread to USA, Chile, Spain,
Mexico and others. The trojan gathers financial information, credit card numbers, and
personal data.

MetaMorfo: ‘Important Information’
We’re going to look into a malspam campaign that dropped the MetaMorfo payload.

4/9

The targets of this malspam campaign were primarily Brazilian citizens. The emails
contained a malicious attachment when opened that would lead to the download of a zip
archive. This file starts the malicious process to drop MetaMorfo onto the victim’s system.

Cisco Umbrella was able to detect the redirect/dropper domains used in this campaign with
intelligence from our statistical models. We convicted the domain when we saw a suspicious
spike in query traffic and other dns factors. For a deeper look into the statistical models that
caught this campaign and others like it, please see some presented research here by Dhia
Mahjoub.

Brazil , US, Canada, China, Italy, Poland, Singapore, Russia, Ireland

Conclusion
Threat actors will use what works to increase malware infections, and the current COVID-19
pandemic is no different. Although it may seem urgent given the current circumstances, it’s
best to treat any attachments or links received from unknown or even known individuals with
7/9

caution before clicking.
Cisco continues to track malicious campaigns themed toward COVID-19 along with the many
other tactics used by cyber criminals. Our statistical models analyze over 200 billion Internet
requests per day, convicting malicious infrastructure before it can be used in attack
campaigns. We can also help you better protect all of your remote users with Cisco
Umbrella.
