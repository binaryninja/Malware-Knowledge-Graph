Southeast Asia: Cyber Threat Landscape

INTRODUCTION
Advanced persistent threat (APT)
actors remain one of the biggest
challenges for companies and
governments alike. Breaches
continue while firms invest in cyber
security and national governments
develop new cyber strategies.
This report discusses trends in the
cyber security environment in
Southeast Asia from January to
June 2015. We will review some
recent cases of attempted
breaches on companies and
governments, and provide an

update on a group we first
identified in 2013 as APT.Nineblog.
Key Findings:
• In the first half of 2015, FireEye
products helped 29 percent of
our customers in Southeast Asia
detect malware used by APT
groups and other cyber threat
actors targeting their networks.
• Countries in the region face
the risk that territorial
disputes, particularly across
the South China Sea, will
expand into cyber operations.

CYBER TRENDS IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA
Southeast Asia faces numerous unique challenges
with regards to cyber security. The region’s
extraordinary pace of economic development and
growing military expenditures constitute two
major reasons why APT actors target
governments and businesses. APT groups seek to
obtain intelligence to provide their sponsoring
government with diplomatic, military, and
economic advantages across the negotiating table
or on the seas.

lingered for decades in some cases. Rival
governments often employ APT groups to
conduct cyber espionage to obtain valuable
political or military intelligence. We routinely
observe APT groups stealing information that
deals with South China Sea disputes and their
economic effects from the networks of
governments and companies involved.
During the first half of 2015, about 29 percent of
our customers in Southeast Asia detected malware
associated with APT groups.2 That remains higher
than our global average of about 20 percent.

Countries in the region continue to face the risk
that persistent territorial disputes, particularly
across the South China Sea, will expand into
cyber operations. China, the Philippines, Brunei,
Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia all contest
territory in the area. These disagreements have

Gaining Global Insights into Cyber Threats
FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) allows us to gain insights into cyber threat activity by gathering real-time
information about the latest cyber threats worldwide. DTI uses millions of FireEye sensors to perform more than 50
billion analyses over 400,000 unique malware samples every day. Through these sensors and the FireEye Managed
Defense and incident response services, FireEye DTI can develop a picture of the current threat landscape.

Southeast Asia: Cyber Threat Landscape

Southeast Asia’s Leading Industries
Attracting APT Malware
More than one-third of malware detections
associated with APT groups originated from
customers in the Entertainment/Media/Hospitality
industry. We have observed at least 12 APT groups
target this industry globally. APT groups likely
target media companies because of their role in
shaping public opinion. In addition, the sponsors of
APT groups often seek early warning about
reporting that is critical of their government.

Governments in the region continue to be
among the most targeted by APT malware in
Southeast Asia—nearly 25 percent. Many of
these could be from rival governments. We
have observed at least four APT groups
targeting regional or state governments
(subdivisions internal to a single country) and
at least 13 APT groups targeting national
government organizations.

REGIONAL CASE STUDIES
Media Companies Subject to
Spear Phishing
In early 2015, suspected China-based cyber
threat actors targeted a media firm in Asia and
attempted to compromise it via a malicious
phishing email. The email contained an attachment
that deployed a MONKEYTILT backdoor.
The media company may have been targeted
because it had published commentary supportive
of an opposition group. The cyber threat group
may also have sought information that would help
authorities monitor public opinion and gain
advanced notice of articles that portrayed the
government negatively.

Targeting Government Organizations
Through Foreign Nationals
In early 2015, we observed continuous attempts
by a suspected China-based cyber threat actor to
compromise a governmental organization in
Southeast Asia with a malicious software
backdoor that we call DIRTNAP. Another iteration
of this campaign also targeted foreign nationals
working with the government. The foreign
nationals received email messages with a

Microsoft Word attachment containing an
embedded Visual Basic for Applications macro
that dropped the DIRTNAP sample once opened.

State-Owned Banks in the Crosshairs
FireEye has observed the CANNONFODDER
backdoor being used consistently throughout the
Southeast Asia region during the past year. We
believe China-based threat groups use
CANNONFODDER to collect political and
economic intelligence. In early and mid-2015, we
observed CANNONFODDER implants beacon
from a Southeast Asian state-owned bank.
Targeting this bank would provide the threat
actors insights into the country’s growth priorities
and likely a competitive edge in business.
In addition to the bank, we have seen other
instances of the malware. In late 2014, we
identified CANNONFODDER implants beaconing
from an Asian telecommunications company. In
mid-2014, we observed cyber threat actors
sending spear phishing emails with malicious
attachments to employees of an Asian
government. Once opened, the attachments
installed the CANNONFODDER implant.

APT.NINEBLOG RETURNS
FireEye has been tracking ongoing activity
associated with a unique and relatively stealthy
group we first identified in 2013 using the name
“APT.NineBlog.“ The name NINEBLOG refers to a
specific backdoor used by the threat group; some
versions of the backdoor use the string ‘nineblog’
in their command and control (CnC) URI path.7
We have observed this group targeting
organizations primarily in South Asia and the
Middle East. The threat group is notable because
it employs Visual Basic Scripts (VBScripts) as a
backdoor, a tactic we do not often observe. The
group can maintain a low profile probably because
the VBScripts are small and stealthy in their
execution. The NINEBLOG malware is difficult to
detect because the VBScripts are encoded and
the actors employ SSL network communications.
We have observed intermittent activity from this
group since we first identified it in 2013, and we
saw a spike in activity during mid-2015.
We assess that one of the probable targets of the
group’s 2015 campaign is a Southeast Asian
government, based on the specificity of some of
the decoy documents.

This article originally appeared in the FireEye
Intelligence Center. FIC provides the latest
FireEye analysis on threat groups, industry
targeting, regional intelligence, and malware in a
library of over 1000 products. FireEye customers
with access to FIC can also use FIC Analysis Tools
to submit IPs/domains, or files for malware
analysis against our Intelligence Database.

Staying Under the Radar
From mid-2013 through mid-2015, FireEye
observed this group deploying numerous exploit
documents. The documents were most likely used
in spear phishing campaigns targeting
organizations in South Asia. The group primarily
uses malicious Microsoft Office documents that
exploit a variety of vulnerabilities (including
CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-1761, and CVE2015-5119, a leaked HackingTeam exploit) to
deliver an encoded VBScript backdoor.8 We only
observed this group use the CVE-2015-5119
exploit after it was made public. This may indicate
that the group does not develop or obtain its own
zero-day exploits, but is opportunistic and capable
of adapting disclosed exploits for its own use.
When an exploit document is opened, it drops a
decoy document and executes a small Portable
Executable (PE) dropper. The dropper has two
embedded VBScripts, one of which is encoded.
The first script deletes the PE dropper file and
itself. The second, encoded VBScript is a backdoor
that we call NINEBLOG.
We noticed the decoded VBScript backdoors
from recent activity were nearly identical (with
some small changes) to the first NINEBLOG
variants we observed in 2013. The minimal code
changes may be due to the fact that the encoding
provides enough obfuscation to prevent
detection, allowing the core functionality of the
backdoor to remain the same.
Additionally, newer variants of the VBScript
include some code enhancements. The differences
in functionality between the first variant we
observed and newer variants can be viewed in the
table below.

Haq, Thoufique and Nart Villeneuve. “The Curious Case of Encoded VB Scripts: APT.NineBlog” 5 August 2013. https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2013/08/the-curious-case-of-encoded-vb-scripts-apt-nineblog.html.

Hacking Team is an Italian software development firm that develops tools – ostensibly sold to governments and law enforcement organizations – that can be
used to remotely monitor victim computers. The company suffered a breach in mid-2015 that resulted in a massive disclosure of sensitive internal
documents, including information on several previously undisclosed zero-day vulnerabilities.

Upon decoding the VBScript backdoors we can observe the code used to implement these new
capabilities, such as the anti-analysis technique seen below:

If(InStr(lall,”wireshark”)>0 Or InStr(lall,”processmonitor”)>0 Or
InStr(lall,”filemonitor”)>0 Or InStr(lall,”windbg”)>0)Then
WScript.Quit
End If

In addition to the anti-analysis techniques, the group has used SSL communications since we first
identified this activity in 2013. The use of encrypted SSL traffic makes it extremely difficult to develop
network-based signatures to detect the malware’s communications.

SPECIAL REPORT

Southeast Asia: Cyber Threat Landscape

Lacking Technical Details for Attribution
The group responsible for the NINEBLOG
activity has used techniques that may indicate a
slightly higher than average skill level and
operational security. These include:

• The use of SSL for malware CnC
communications. The use of SSL for malware
CnC communications makes it extremely
difficult to use network-based signatures to
detect malware traffic.

• The use of an encoded Visual Basic Script
(NINEBLOG) as a backdoor, as opposed to a
compiled PE binary. VBScript is less likely than
a binary executable to be detected as malicious
by many security products than a binary
executable, and the obfuscation further masks
the backdoor’s purpose and functionality.

• The ability to identify publicly disclosed
vulnerabilities and adapt them for use. This
implies that the group either has some
development capability, or has access to
developers, tools, or forums where they can
obtain weaponized documents to deploy
their malware.

• The use of a dynamic DNS (DDNS) provider to
register their CnC domains. The use of DDNS
allows the group to hide the domains’
registration details, and allows them to
dynamically redirect their CnC communications
to different IP addresses as needed.

We assess that this group may be acting on
behalf of a government based on the group’s
known targets and the subject matter of their
phishing lures and decoy documents. However,
we do not have enough information at this time
to assess a possible sponsor.

Eastern threat actors.

Description:

This malware is a publicly available remote access tool
(RAT) capable of keystroke logging, credential
harvesting, reverse shell access, file uploads and
downloads, and file and registry modifications. This RAT
also offers threat actors a "builder" feature, allowing
them to create new variants based on configurations of
CnC servers, specified filenames, options to spread via
USB, designated campaign names for internal tracking,
and other customization options. Additionally, this RAT
gathers and sends important information about infected
machines to its CnC server, possibly using a custom
protocol over port 80, to include NetBIOS name, user,
date, locale, and Windows OS name. Traditionally, threat
actors that deploy this RAT primarily use websites
hosting EXE files to propagate the malware.

Backdoor.APT.CANNONFODDER
Summary:

This backdoor enables threat actors to modify, upload
and download files, collect system information and grant
command line access to a victim's computer.

Description:

This malware is capable of stealing credentials from
