Resecurity, Inc. (USA), a Los Angeles-based cybersecurity company providing managed
threat detection and response for Fortune 500's, identified threat actors leveraging Open
Redirect Vulnerabilities popular in online services and apps to bypass spam filters to
ultimately deliver phishing content.
Using highly trusted service domains like Snapchat and other online-services, they create
special URLs which lead to malicious resources with phishing kits. The kit identified is
named LogoKit, which was previously used in attacks against the customers of Office 365,
Bank of America, GoDaddy, Virgin Fly, and many other major financial institutions and
online-services internationally.
The spike of LogoKit was been identified around the beginning of August, when multiple
new domain names impersonating popular services had been registered and leveraged
together with Open Redirects. While LogoKit is known for a while in the underground, at
least since 2015, the cybercrime group behind it is constantly leveraging new tactics.
LogoKit is known for its dynamic content generation using JavaScript – it is able to change
logos (of the impersonated service) and text on the landing pages in real-time to adapt on
the fly, by doing so the targeted victims are more likely to interact with the malicious
resource. Around November 2021, there were over 700 identified domains names used in
campaigns leveraging LogoKit – their number is constantly growing.
Notably, the actors prefer to use domain names in exotic jurisdictions or zones with
relatively poor abuse management process - .gq, .ml, .tk, ga, .cf or to gain unauthorized
access to legitimate WEB-resources, and then use them as hosting for further phishing
distribution.
LogoKit relies on sending users phishing links that contain their email addresses. Once the
victim navigates to the URL, LogoKit fetches the company logo from a third-party service,
such as Clearbit or Google's favicon database. The victim’s email is then auto filled in the
email or username field which consequently tricks them into feeling they’ve previously
logged in before. Should the victim then enter their password, LogoKit performs an AJAX
request, sending the target's email and password to an external source, then finally
redirecting the victim to their “legitimate” corporate website.

These tactics allow cybercriminals to masquerade their activity behind the notifications of
legitimate services to evade detection, thus tricking the victim into accessing the malicious
resource. Unfortunately, the use of Open Redirect vulnerabilities significantly facilitates
LogoKit distribution, as many (even popular) online-services don’t treat such bugs as
critical, and in some cases – don’t even patch, leaving the open door for such abuse.
Let’s take a closer look at how it works on the example of the campaign identified in July
13th, it was targeting Office 365 users from the U.S. and Latin America:

This is an example of an email containing text and a link with an embedded link inside it

The embedded link is leveraging Open Redirect Vulnerability in Snapchat, and another
URL from Google leading to a phishing resource:
https://click[.]snapchat.com/aVHG?
=http://29781.google.com&af_web_dp=http://bz.pn83f.parquedelprado.com.do.#.aHR0cH
M6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXBpLmZsZWVrLmNvLzBhZDkxYjFjLTk5OTQtNGExZC1iZjg4LTE4Y2
YwN2RiYWY1Mi1idWNrZXQvY29udGludWUuaHRtbD8jY29udGFjdEByZXNlY3VyaXR5L

Notably, some of the observed anti-spam mechanisms don’t flag such links as malicious
scoring them as trusted.
Once we decoded it, we found another link which contains the email address of the victim
in question:
https://storageapi.fleek[.]co/0ad91b1c-9994-4a1d-bf88-18cf07dbaf52bucket/continue.html?#contact@victim.com

The attacker used the Open Redirect in Snapchat to redirect the victim to new URL
http://bz.pn83f.parquedelprado.com[.]do

The content of the pages generated by LogoKit is typically obfuscated.

Here you can see the code that deals with the Base64 portion of the attack.

And here is the redirection part.

The final page is leading to phishing impersonating Microsoft Office 365:

Numerous others were identified with A records leveraging exactly the same domains:

Initially, multiple victims received phishing links from compromised emails registered at

Notably, the actors are using hacked WEB-resources leveraging the access to them for
placing phishing without owners knowledge:

And here we can see how the attacker was using the fleek service to host their malicious
code.

LogoKit have already been identified on more than 300 domains which took place over the
past week, and more than 700 sites over the past month.
