A review of the latest wave of organized phishing attacks by Iranian state-backed hackers

Abstract
Phishing attacks are the most common form of infiltration used by Iranian state-backed
hackers to gain access into accounts. Certfa reviews the latest campaign of phishing
attacks that has been carried out and dubbed as “The Return of The Charming Kitten”.
In this campaign, hackers have targeted individuals who are involved in economic and
military sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran as well as politicians, civil and
human rights activists and journalists around the world.
Our review in Certfa demonstrates that the hackers - knowing that their victims use twostep verification - target verification codes and also their email accounts such as Yahoo!
and Gmail. As a result, Certfa believes the safest existing way to confront these attacks is
using Security Keys such as YubiKey.

Introduction
In early October 2018, MD0ugh, a Twitter user 1, revealed phishing attacks of a group of
Iranian hackers against US financial institution infrastructure. According to this user, these
attacks could possibly be a reaction to new sanctions against Iran.
The account mentioned a domain with the address accounts[-]support[.]services for the
first time. This domain is linked to a group of hackers who are supported by the Iranian
government, and that we believe have close ties with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps (IRGC). ClearSky 2 has previously published detailed reports on their activities.
A month after these attacks, the administrators of accounts-support[.]services expanded
their activities and started targeting civil and human rights activists, political figures and
also Iranian and Western journalists.

Methods of Attacks
1/8

Our investigation illustrates that the attackers are utilising different methods to carry out
their attacks. These methods can be put into two categories:
1. Phishing attacks through unknown email or social media and messaging accounts
2. Phishing attacks through email or social media and messaging accounts of public
figures, which have been hacked by the attackers
We have also found that the hackers have collected information on their targets prior to the
phishing attack. The hackers design specific plans for each target based on the level of
targets’ cyber knowledge, their contacts, activities, working time, and their geographic
situation.
We also noticed that, unlike in previous phishing campaigns, in some cases the hackers did
not change the password of their victims’ accounts in these latest attacks. This allows
them to remain undetected and monitor a victim’s communications via their email in real
time.

Fake alerts of unauthorised access
According to the samples of phishing attacks, the main trick used by these hackers to
deceive their targets is that of sending fake alerts through email addresses such as
notifications.mailservices@gmail[.]com, noreply.customermails@gmail[.]com,
customer]email-delivery[.]info etc. stating that unauthorised individuals have tried to access
their accounts.

By using this method, attackers pretend that the email provider has sent security alerts to
the targets and they should immediately review and restrict suspicious accesses. More
details are available in the “Destination Link” section.

Fake file sharing on Google Drive
Sending links with titles such as share files from Google Drive has been one of the most
common tricks that hackers have used in recent years. A unique point of these attacks in
comparison with the previous ones is that they use Google Site3, which allows the hackers
to show a fake download page of Google Drive, which tricks the users into thinking it’s a
real Google Drive page.
Figure 2. A fake page of Google Drive file sharing page

Figure 2. A fake page of Google Drive file sharing page
For example, the hacker had used hxxps://sites.google[.]com/view/sharingdrivesystem to
deceive the users and convince them the page is the authentic Google Drive as users can
see google.com in the address bar of their browsers. Certfa has reported this link and
similar links to Google and Google has now terminated them.

2/8

By creating websites with the same design and look of Google Drive file sharing page,
hackers pretend to be sharing a file with the user, which they should download and run it on
their devices. They use hacked Twitter, Facebook and Telegram accounts to send these links
and target new users. The truth is there is not any file and the hackers use this page to direct
their targets to the fake Google login page, which the users enter their credential details
including 2 factor authentication.

The Attack Structure
Most of these attacks are currently occurring through phishing emails. As a result, it would
be useful to take a look the original content in recent phishing campaigns.

1. Destination link
1.1. Trusted Stage: Internet users around the world consider Google’s main domain
(google.com) to be a safe and secure address. The attackers misuse this fact and create
fake pages on sites.google.com (which is a subdomain of Google) to deceive their targets.
Google’s Site service gives its users an ability to show various contents on it. The attackers
use this ability to send fake alerts and redirect their targets to insecure websites or
embedded phishing pages as a iframe on those pages.
Figure 4. How attackers misuse site.google.com

Figure 4. How attackers misuse site.google.com
1.2. Untrusted Stage: Since Google can quickly recognise and eliminate suspicious and
malicious links on sites.google.com, the hackers use their own website. The links of
phishing websites have similar patterns to a previous phishing campaign which was
launched in the past years. For example, attackers use words such as “management”,
“customize”, “service”, “identification”, “session”, “confirm” etc. in the domains name and
phishing URLs to deceive users who want to verify their website addresses.

2. Clickable image in emails
The hackers use an image, instead of texts, in the body of their emails, to bypass Google’s
security and anti-phishing system. For this purpose, attackers have also used third party
services such as Firefox Screenshot4 to host their email images.

3. Hidden tracking image on emails
3/8

The attackers use a separate hidden image in the body of the email to notify them when
their targets open the email. This trick helps the hackers to act immediately after the target
opens the email and clicks on the phishing link.

Phishing Pages
Apart from the content structure of the emails and phishing links, we are sure that
attackers use a customized platform to create and store users’ credential details. We have
also noticed that they have designed the phishing pages for both desktop and mobile
versions of Google and Yahoo! mail services and they might use other services in the
future.
An interesting technique they have used in recent attacks was once their target enters their
username and password, attackers check those credentials on-the-fly and if that
information was given correctly, they then ask for 2-step verification code.
In other words, they check victims’ usernames and passwords in realtime on their own
servers, and even if 2 factor authentication such as text message, authenticator app or
one-tap login are enabled they can trick targets and steal that information too.
Figures 6 to 9 demonstrate some examples of the phishing pages, which have been sent to
the targets by the Iranian hackers.

Hacker’s Footprints
Our primary reviews of the phishing websites linked to this campaign show that hackers
have set up a remarkable number of domains. Our latest findings show that for this
phishing campaign in a relatively short period of time, (September to November 2018), they
have used more than 20 domain names. The number of phishing domains has increased at
the time of writing this report. Closer investigation of these servers revealed how their
network of domain names have been used in recent attacks.

gathered by Certfa5
Moreover, our technical reviews reveal that the individuals, who are involved in this
campaign used Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and proxies with Dutch and French IP
addresses to hide their original location. In spite of their efforts, we have uncovered enough
evidence to prove that the attackers were using their real IP addresses (i.e 89.198.179[.]103
and 31.2.213[.]18 from Iran during the preparation phase of their campaign).
Also, some domain names and servers of this campaign are very similar to the methods,
techniques and targets that been used by Charming Kitten, a group of hackers who are
linked to the Iranian government. Consequently, we believe Charming Kitten and the Iranian
hacker(s) belonging to this group have returned and launched new cyber attacks against
various people around the world and with more focus on Israeli and American citizens.

Conclusion
Phishing attacks are the most popular method of stealing data and hacking account
amongst Iranian hackers, but the most significant fact about this campaign is its timing.
This campaign launched weeks before 4 November 2018 which is when the U.S. imposed
new sanctions on Iran. This campaign tries to collect information by infiltrating the
accounts of non-Iranian political figures and authorities who work on economic and
military sanctions against Iran.
In other words, hackers who are supported by the Iranian government pick their targets
according to policies and international interests for the Iranian government and also where
Iran wants to have impact indirectly.
A a result, we propose a series of recommendations to tech companies, policymakers, civil
society actors and internet users to effectively lessen the threat of this type of attack and
even thwart them.
Our recommendations to tech companies and policy makers:
Stop using 2 factor authentication by text plain message/SMS.
Start using Security Keys (i.e. YubiKey) for 2 factor authentication for high ranking
individuals who have sensitive jobs or activities.
Do not use one-tap login verification process.
Our recommendations to civil society and the Iranian diaspora media:
Inform employees and colleagues about any phishing threats and encourage them to
use Security Keys such as Yubikey for 2 factor authentication and activate Google’s
Advanced Protection Program.
Always use company and institution email accounts instead of personal email for
sensitive communications. Change Sender Policy Framework or SPF 6 settings
according to the communication policy of the company/organisation such as
restricting receiving emails from outside of the working network. For example, G
Suite allows admins to block receiving emails from unauthorised address or

domains7.
Encourage the public to enable 2 factor authentication on their account by mobile
apps such as Google Authenticator.
Our recommendations to users:
Do not click on unknown links. For reviewing suspicious activities on your account or
change the password, instead of clicking on any link, you can go to your “My
Account” settings from your email directly which is more safer.
Use email encryption such PGP for sensitive emails which prevent hackers reading
your emails in the first place.
Do not store classified and sensitive information as a plain text in your mailbox.
HTTPS being before a domain names in a URL does not mean that the content of a
website is secure or trusted - it’s just a secure extension of the HTTP protocol. Do not
forget many phishing websites are currently operating under HTTPS protocol too.
