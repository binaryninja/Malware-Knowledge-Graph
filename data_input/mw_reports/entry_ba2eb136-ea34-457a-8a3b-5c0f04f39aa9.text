Uses Discord nitro gift subscription as ransom. C# Ransomware for educational purposes
only

About
Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their files in
their sysem. It locks the user's files until the ransom is paid, in this case, a Discord nitro
subscription. If a user wants to unlock their files, a decryption key is needed. The
ransomware asks for the ransom in exchange for the decryption key.

Disclaimer
This Ransomware should not be used to harm/threat/hurt others. Its purpose is only to share
knowledge and awareness about Malware/Cryptography/Operating Systems/Programming.
NitroRansomware is an academic ransomware made for learning and spreading awareness
about how security/cryptography can be used maliciously.

How it works
When the .exe file is run, it encrypts the user's Documents, Desktop, and Pictures folder. It
then recursively checks for any nested folders in the folders, and encrypts all of its contents.
In order to decrypt the files, the user has to paste a valid Discord nitro gift subscription and
1/3

submit it. The program checks if it is valid, and if it is, it is sent to your webhook. The user
receives the decryption key which allows them to decrypt the encrypted files. If it is not, the
decrypion key will not be sent, and the user wil not be able to open their files.
This program should only be used for educational purposes only. Do not use this on others
maliciously.
