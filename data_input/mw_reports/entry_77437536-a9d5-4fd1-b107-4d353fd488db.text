Evicting Maze
Talos and SecureX stop an active attack cold in its tracks
In the summer of 2020, a manufacturing company received
a phishing email containing a malicious attachment. After
an employee opened the email, several suspicious activities
occurred, including the execution of encoded PowerShell
commands to obtain elevated privileges, with indications of
use of the penetration-testing tool Cobalt Strike.
In the week that followed, the company received a
notification from Cisco SecureX Threat Hunting warning
about the PowerShell execution as a potential precursor to
a ransomware attack. The company soon contacted CTIR at
the behest of their legal counsel.
CTIR provided emergency response services, including
incident command, expert guidance on containment and
remediation, forensic analysis, threat intelligence and reverseengineering. CTIR began reviewing data from the Secure
Endpoint, SecureX Cloud Edge, and Secure Network Analytics
consoles, as well as triage data from affected hosts.
Leveraging threat intelligence from Talos’ Threat
Intelligence and Interdiction team, CTIR and Talos
concluded that the activity Cisco SecureX Threat Hunting
alerted on was likely the beginning stages of a Maze
ransomware attack. Now allegedly disbanded, Maze was
one of the more notorious ransomware families of late,
engaging in “big game hunting,” or targeting prominent
organizations for large ransoms, and innovating the practice
of exfiltrating data prior to dropping their ransomware, and
then threatening to release the stolen data as another lever
to compel victims to pay the ransom.
Maze adversaries typically maintain a long dwell time on the
victim network as they search for privileged accounts and
sensitive information. CTIR assessed that the adversaries
had indeed been on the network several weeks before
CTIR was engaged. However, this dwell time provided an
opportunity for CTIR to identify the threat actor and thwart
the more destructive elements of the attack.
From previous Maze attacks, Talos had developed a
playbook that matched typical Maze tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs) to ATT&CK information, as well as
associated search strings in Secure Endpoint.

While reviewing malicious activity in Secure Endpoint data
and associated ATT&CK information, CTIR realized that
much of the TTPs appearing in this engagement were
similar to previous Maze incidents. We discovered similar
system information and owner discovery. The attackers
also leveraged procdump for credential dumping and
used privileged accounts to traverse the network. All of
these TTPs looked identical to what was happening at the
manufacturing company. The use of Cobalt Strike and a
command and control (C2) IP address previously associated
with a Maze attack confirmed the likely connection to Maze.
CTIR had additionally drawn up guides for combating Maze
attacks and remediation strategies. Because of this, CTIR
quickly delivered a plan of action (POA) to the customer
the day they were engaged, containing a series of steps to
take to prevent the adversary from accessing even more
systems, exfiltrating data and dropping their ransomware.
These steps included:

•

Preparing an Active Directory Domain password reset.

•
•
•
•
•

Changing passwords of accounts in highly
privileged groups.
Rolling Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (KRBTGT)
twice.
Changing built-in local admin password.
Forcing password change on next login for general
user accounts.
Disabling the ability of the Windows operating
system to cache credentials on any device where
credentials are not needed.

•

Installing and setting up Microsoft Local Administrative
Password Solutions (LAPS) to provide management of
and strong passwords for all local administrator accounts.

•

Ensuring that backups are offline and separated from the
impacted machines in network

•

Limiting access to PowerShell, PSExec, Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI), Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP), SMB and administrative shares to
trusted accounts or systems that have a legitimate
access to such tools.

Case Study: Evicting Maze
The customer was very receptive to the plan of action and
actively began implementing these recommendations.
These actions had an immediate effect on the adversary’s
ability to move laterally throughout the network. With
passwords reset, they had lost their privileged accounts.
With access to PowerShell locked down, they could not
execute commands. Locking down SMB and RDP prevented
them from spreading to more machines on the network,
and with backups isolated, the potential for encryption
decreased.
The customer also had Secure Endpoint deployed, but
in Audit mode so that malicious files would be alerted on
but not necessarily quarantined. CTIR worked with the
customer to push Secure Endpoint throughout the network
and ensure it was running in Protect mode.
With their avenues for lateral movement restricted, the
adversaries dropped the ransomware binary on all systems
they had previously accessed. The adversaries dropped the
malicious DLL file on 130 systems. However, with Secure

Endpoint running in Protect mode, the file was successfully
quarantined, and the ransomware component of the attack
was prevented.
Meanwhile, Talos safely detonated the ransomware file in
Secure Malware Analytics. From there, they obtained the
ransom note that confirmed the analysts’ assessment that
this was, in fact, a Maze ransomware attack.
CTIR continued analysis and remediation efforts. Although
some NetFlow data indicated potential exfiltration, CTIR
found no evidence of data staging and, as opposed to many
other Maze victims, had no stolen information posted on the
Maze leaks website.
This engagement exemplifies how CTIR leverages Taloswide resources, past experience and their expertise
to deliver quick identification of threats as well as
recommendations for remediation. With an active customer,
CTIR prevented one of the most dangerous ransomware
threat actors from achieving their goal.
