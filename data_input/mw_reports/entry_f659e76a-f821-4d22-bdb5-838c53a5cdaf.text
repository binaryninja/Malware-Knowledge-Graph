Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

Attacking the Heart of the German
Industry
For a number of years now, a group of professional hackers has been busy spying on businesses all over the world: Winnti. Believed to be controlled by China. For the rst time, in a joint
investigation, German public broadcasters BR and NDR are shedding light on how the hackers
operate and how widespread they are. — by Hakan Tanriverdi, Svea Eckert, Jan Strozyk, Maximilian Zierer and Rebecca Ciesielski
Unser Bericht zur digitalen „Söldnertruppe“, die Industriespionage betreibt.

This investigation starts with a code: daa0 c7cb f4f0 fbcf d6d1 . If you know what to
look for, you’ll nd Winnti. Hackers who have been spying on businesses all over the world for
years. A group, presumably China-based, has honed in on Germany and its DAX corporations.
For the rst time ever, BR and NDR reporters have successfully analyzed hundreds of the malware versions used for that unsavory purpose. The targets: At least six DAX corporations, the
stock-listed top companies of the German industry.

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

 Malware: Malicious software, like computer viruses or Trojans.

Winnti is a highly complex structure that is di cult to penetrate. The term denotes both a sophisticated malware and an actual group of hackers. IT security experts like to call them digital
mercenaries. Since at least 2011, these hackers have been using malware to spy on corporate
networks. Their mode of operation: to collect information on the organizational charts of companies, on cooperating departments, on the IT systems of individual business units, and on
trade secrets, obviously.
Asked about the group an IT security expert who has been analyzing the attacks for years
replies, tongue in cheek: “Any DAX corporation that hasn’t been attacked by Winnti must have
done something wrong.” A high-ranking German o cial says: “The numbers of cases are mindboggling.” And claims that the group continues to be highly active—to this very day. The o cial’s name will remain undisclosed, as will names of the more than 30 people whom we were
able to interview for this article: Company sta , IT security experts, government o cials, and
representatives of security authorities. They are either not willing or not allowed to speak
frankly. But they are allowed to reveal some of their tactics.
This allows us to nd the software and to gure out for ourselves how the attackers work.
Thanks to the help received from the informers, we, the reporters, are able to get on to the
group. Part of their trail is the following code: daa0 c7cb f4f0 fbcf d6d1 .
Modern-day espionage operations have one big advantage: Instead of painstakingly planting
agents in companies, digital spies are simply sending prepared emails. Instead of taking pictures of con dential documents while the rest of the sta is out to lunch, hackers can remotely
log on to company computers and send their commands from their keyboard. But every hacking operation also comes with a huge drawback. It leaves digital traces. If you notice hackers,
you can log their every step. The hackers themselves have no clue that they are under meticulous scrutiny, sometimes even for months at a time.
 Logging: The hackers’ individual steps are stored in log les.

To decipher the traces of hackers, you need to take a closer look at the program code of the
malware itself. It can be found in databases operated by private companies like “Virustotal.”
The company is owned by Google and is a kind of malware search engine. The information
stored in that database is so valuable to IT consultants and security companies that they pay
thousands of Euros per month for accessing it. Anybody who is unsure whether a mail attachment contains a Trojan can have it checked in that database by more than 50 antivirus programs. In return, Virustotal stores the le with the aid of a digital ngerprint. This digital ngerprint allows others to search for the le and to analyze the codes it contains. People like
ourselves.

Every le has a digital ngerprint—which makes is clearly identi able.
In former times, it was solely the job of intelligence agencies to uncover espionage operations.
Nowadays, corporations and IT security companies prefer to employ sta earning six- gure
salaries for that purpose. Their job is to search the corporate networks and Virustotal for evidence of hacker groups. After all, it is the companies they work for which are being spied on—
and the companies’ secret formulas and building plans warrant absolute protection. Professionally, these employees are on a par with the security services. It is one of those professionals who meets with us and hands us a piece of paper.
“This might help you nd the hackers”, the gentleman tells us. He believes that because they
are spying on so many targets at the same time, they have to gure out how to keep track. He
also believes that the hackers chose convenience over anonymity. We soon realize how incredibly negligent the hackers are. We are working with Moritz Contag, an IT security expert a liated with Ruhr University Bochum (RUB). What we nd: The hackers are writing the names of the
companies they want to spy on directly into their malware. Contag has analyzed more than
250 variations of the Winnti malware and found them to contain the names of global
corporations.
Hackers usually take precautions, which experts refer to as Opsec. The Winnti group’s Opsec
was dismal to say the least. Somebody who has been keeping an eye on Chinese hackers on
behalf of a European intelligence service believes that they didn’t really care: “These hackers
don’t care if they’re found out or not. They care only about achieving their goals."
 Opsec: Operational Security. It is a collective term for all the steps taken by hackers to cover their tracks.

The sheet of paper the sta member is showing us has a code printed on it: daa0 c7cb
f4f0 fbcf d6d1 . We are looking for the same string of characters in Virustotal, the gigantic
database of infected les. And we succeed.

Step 3: For the hackers to keep track of which network they are currently invading, they
simply write it directly into their program. In the example shown herein, the Winnti hackers are inside the networks of Gameforge .

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

Phase 1: Cybercrime
It would seem that during the early stages, the hackers were concerned mainly about making
money. Gameforge is a case in point: a gaming company based in the German town of Karlsruhe. During its heyday, the company had a sta of 700 working hard at conquering the global
gaming market, and boasted annual sales to the tune of 140 million Euros. Gameforge o ers
so-called “freemium” games. While playing the games is free, those who want more either have
to earn virtual money by completing certain tasks, which takes a long time, or shell out real
money.
We are told that in 2011, an email message found its way into Gameforge’s mailbox in Karlsruhe. A sta member opened the attached le and unbeknownst to him started the hackers’
Winnti program. Shortly afterwards, a few players became virtual rich persons.
https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/

8/26

7/25/2019

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

The administrators became aware that someone was directly accessing Gameforge’s databases and raising the account balance. They started getting worried. How could this be happening? The technicians used the next maintenance interval to reinstall the servers of the a ected
game. The players didn’t have a clue about what’s going on. No sooner were the servers back
up than the manipulations continued.
Gameforge decided to implement Kaspersky antivirus software, which didn't cause any alarm
bells to ring. Gameforge arranged for Kaspersky's IT security experts to come directly to Karlsruhe. Because obviously there was something weird going on. Nobody thought to inform the
State Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the local police. The year was 2011, and many investigators were barely familiar with the term or concept of cybercrime.

While keeping an eye on Gameforge’s corporate network, the IT security experts did nd suspicious les and decided to analyze them. They noticed that the system had in fact been in ltrated by hackers—who were acting like Gameforge’s administrators most of the time. Which allowed them to remain invisible. It turned out that the hackers have taken over a total of 40
servers.
This mode of operation is typical of many hacker groups—and especially of Winnti. “They are a
very, very persistente group,” says Costin Raiu, who has been watching Winnti since 2011. Raiu
is in charge of Kaspersky’s malware analysis team. “Once the Winnti hackers are inside a network, they take their sweet time to really get a feel for the infrastructure,” he says.
 Persistent: It is very hard to permanently remove the hackers from the network.

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

The hackers will map a company’s network and look for strategically favorable locations for
placing their malware. They keep tabs on which programs are used in a company and then exchange a le in one of these programs. The modi ed le looks like the original, but was secretly
supplemented by a few extra lines of code. From now on, this manipulated le does the attackers’ bidding.

“

Winnti is very speci c to Germany. It is the attacker group
that's being encountered most frequently.
Anonymous government o cial

Raiu and his team have followed the digital tracks left behind by some of the Winnti hackers.
“Nine years ago, things were much more clear-cut. There was a single team, which developed
and used Winnti. It now looks like there is at least a second group that also uses Winnti.” This
view is shared by many IT security companies. And it is this second group which is getting the
German security authorities so worried. One government o cial puts it very matter-of-factly:
“Winnti is very speci c to Germany. It is the attacker group that's being encountered most
frequently."

Phase 2: Industrial espionage
By 2014, the Winnti malware code was no longer limited to game manufacturers. The second
group’s job is mainly industrial espionage. Hackers are targeting high-tech companies as well
as chemical and pharmaceutical companies. We nd evidence going as far as mid-2019. Cases
of espionage which were probably still ongoing when we discovered them. Winnti is attacking
companies in Japan, France, the U.S. and Germany. Or more precisely: in Düsseldorf.
Most people probably know the DAX company Henkel as a manufacturer of detergents and
shampoos. But Henkel o ers a huge range of other products, including adhesives for industrial
applications. Modern cars are glued instead of welded. In a commercial on Youtube, Henkel
shows sta members successfully joining two metal plates with just three grams of adhesive
and then using the plates to pull a 280-ton train. Nearly half of Henkel’s annual sales of 20 billion Euros are generated by Henkel’s so-called “adhesive technologies".
The Winnti hackers broke into Henkel’s network in 2014. We have three les showing that this
happened. Each of these les contains the same website belonging to Henkel and the name of
the hacked server. For example, one starts with the letter sequence DEDUSSV. We realize that
server names can be arbitrary, but it is highly probable that DE stands for Germany and DUS
https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/

for Düsseldorf, where the company headquarters are located. The hackers were able to monitor all activities running on the web server. And they also seemed to be able to reach systems
which didn't have direct internet access: Internal storage les and possibly even the intranet.
The corporation con rms the Winnti incident and issues the following statement: “The cyberattack was discovered in the summer of 2014 and Henkel promptly took all necessary precautions.” Henkel claims that a “very small portion” of its worldwide IT systems had been a ected
— the systems in Germany. According to Henkel, there was no evidence suggesting that any
sensitive data had been diverted.

How we worked
BR and NDR reporters, in collaboration with several IT security experts, have analyzed
the Winnti malware. It was notably Moritz Contag of Ruhr University Bochum who managed to extract information from di erent varieties of the malware. Contag wrote a
script for this analysis. Silas Cutler, an IT security expert with US-based Chronicle Security, has con rmed Contag’s analyses.

A collaboration between

and

Far from attacking Henkel and the other companies arbitrarily, Winnti takes a highly strategic
approach. Which is perfectly evident from the other cases. Take Covestro, for example, also a
manufacturer of adhesives, lacquers and paints. This chemical corporation, a Bayer spin-o , is
now listed on the DAX. Covestro is regarded as Germany’s most successful spin-o in the recent past. Up until June 2019, they had at least two systems on which the Winnti malware had
been installed. Although there is no concrete evidence of data loss, Covestro considers “this
evidence of infection to be a serious attack on our company.” Another manufacturer of adhesives, Bostik of France, was infected with Winnti in early 2019.
The hackers behind Winnti have also set their sights on Japan’s biggest chemical company,
Shin-Etsu Chemical. We have in our hands several varieties of the 2015 malware which was
most likely used for the attack. In the case of another Japanese company, Sumitomo Electric,
Winnti apparently penetrated their networks during the summer of 2016. And consider Roche,
one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world: the sheer number of les, 25 in total, gives you an idea of the degree of network penetration by the hackers. Winnti hackers also

https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

penetrated the BASF and Siemens networks. Both corporations have con rmed our research
data.
A BASF spokeswoman tells us in an email that in July 2015, hackers had successfully overcome
“the rst levels” of defense. “When our experts discovered that the attacker was attempting to
get around the next level of defense, the attacker was removed promptly and in a coordinated
manner from BASF’s network.” She added that no business relevant information had been lost
at any time. According to Siemens, they were penetrated by the hackers in June 2016. “We
quickly discovered and thwarted the attack,” Siemens told us in a written reply. Siemens claims
that even after detailed analyses, no evidence suggesting data loss from the attack has been
found to date.

Targeted companies

 Software: Teamviewer
 Technology: Siemens, Sumitomo, Thyssenkrupp

 Chemical: BASF, Covestro, Shin-Etsu
Bostik, Sumitomo and Shin-Etsu didn’t respond to our requests for comments at all. Roche
chose to keep their response neutral. A spokesperson replied that “information security and
data protection are taken very seriously.” Nearly all major corporations now emphasize that
there is no such thing as one hundred percent protection. Hacking attacks on large companies
have become almost commonplace. And yet: No company really likes to talk about having
hackers in its own networks. In many cases, customers are not informed. They are justi ably
scared of damage to their reputation.
Teamviewer is a case in point. A company based in the southwest of Germany, a bona de Silicon Valley contender, and a true showpiece enterprise. It was quickly traded at a nine-digit valuation, the highest accolade for a newly incorporated enterprise. Then came the Winnti hackers. “Spiegel” magazine was the rst to report about it.
The corporation o ers a remote maintenance software solution which, according to Teamviewer, is installed on two billion devices. To imagine the mayhem a hacker might cause by in ltrathttps://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/

ing the end users’ devices via the Teamviewer application—it boggles the mind. But things
didn’t get that far for Teamviewer, the company assures us. They add that they replaced their
entire IT infrastructure and spent millions on removing the hackers from their networks in
2016.

The second way to nd Winnti
For the IT departments, the infected computers are extremely di cult to detect. That is because a new variety of this malware remains perfectly passive as long as it is left alone. How
can you nd something that’s playing dead? Since 2018 there’s a public tool available designed
to systematically trawl the Internet for these infected systems. This network scan works by luring the software out of its hiding spot.

con dence. Thanks to this tool, we found out back in March 2019 that the Bayer pharmaceutical group had been hacked by Winnti.
 Have you kept count? So far, ten companies have been a ected, most of them in Germany.

https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

The tool was written by sta of Thyssenkrupp, because the industrial giant—company number
eleven—had been spied on by Winnti. In 2016, the corporation allowed a reporter from
“Wirtschaftswoche” to watch the attackers being pushed back. The magazine later wrote of a
“six-month defensive battle.” The hackers had succeeded in extracting small data sets of importance for the construction of plants. The company mentions “data fragments” and believes
that the hackers have missed their actual target, tapping into the corporation’s research
results.

The trail leading to China
At Gameforge, the Winnti hackers had already been removed from the networks when a sta
member noticed a Windows start screen with Chinese characters. Presumably, the hackers
were using tools in their native language, which would have made their work easier. But they
forgot to cover up their tracks. Just another mistake they made, one of many.
In October 2016, several DAX corporations, including BASF and Bayer, founded the German
Cyber Security Organization (DCSO). The job of DCSO’s IT security experts is to observe and
recognize hacker groups like Winnti and to get to the bottom of their motives. In Winnti’s case,
DCSO speaks of a “mercenary force” which is said to be closely linked with the Chinese government. They have been tracking the group for a long time: “We can, based on many, many indicators, say with high con dence that Winnti is being directed by the Chinese.”

“

We can, based on many, many indicators, say with high condence that Winnti is being directed by the Chinese
Dror-John Röcher, DCSO

Many of the experts we talked to believe that the group is operating out of mainland China. “I
don’t care if the hackers work in green uniforms or are commissioned by people wearing green
uniforms,” says an IT security expert, alluding to a suspected proximity to the country’s military
intelligence service.
It would seem that in the early days, Winnti hackers were still quite careless. One of them left
many traces on the Internet. In 2013, the Kaspersky team was able to follow clues in their
code. This is how Costin Raiu and his colleagues came across a person using the alias
“Mer4en7y.” This individual was active in hacker forums where he commented in Chinese on a
job o er for recruiting hackers. There was mention of a “powerful background.” “And

https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/

20/26

7/25/2019

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

‘Mer4en7y’ replied that the job was too far away for him, but that he was in full support of the
work,” says Raiu.
On 30 October 2018, the US government brought charges against ten Chinese nationals. Two
of them are believed to be working for one of China’s intelligence services. Hackers are
charged with spying on a manufacturer of gas turbines. Also charged in connection with the
crime: “Mer4en7y”, who is believed to have been acting on behalf of the intelligence service
and to have used the Winnti software for the hack. IT security experts attribute the cyberattack
to a di erent Chinese group. But the charges led are testimony to the close links between at
least one Winnti hacker and the government.

The US government is accusing the individual going by the alias Mer4en7y of using the Winnti
software
Janka Oertel of the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Berlin has been keeping a close eye on China. Oertel considers it “very unlikely that large-scale cyber operations
could be happening without at least parts of the Chinese party-state knowing about them.”
Oertel, a political scientist, emphasizes that China wants to play a “signi cant market role” in
key industries such as materials research by 2025 and to dominate the world market by 2035.
“In some of these areas, however, China has not yet managed to achieve its goals without technology transfers—including transfers from Germany,” Oertel adds.
A government o cial familiar with the hacking cases agrees: “Cyber incidents allow us to draw
conclusions as to a nation’s true priorities.” The point, he believes, is to understand one’s own

https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/

industry and to gure out what cannot be produced fast enough. The missing materials are
then procured by hacking operations.
But a former sta er of a European intelligence agency warns: “If I wanted to hack anyone right
now, I’d make it look like a Chinese group.” He warns against underestimating the pro ciency of
hackers working for governments. After all, he says, laying false trails is their job.
People working for the German intelligence agencies tell us that, although all current ndings
suggest that Winnti originates from China, much of the evidence is based on data that is several years old. “We have a knowledge gap for the past two to three years,” says one individual familiar with the incidents.”

“

If I wanted to hack anyone right now, I’d make it look exactly like a Chinese group.
Former sta er of a European intelligence agency

While Germany does address industrial espionage in direct talks with the Chinese leadership,
these attempts are considered a waste of time. “Fruitless,” says one individual who knows how
these meetings work. The other side denies everything, he says, and what’s left at the end of
the day are meaningless declarations of intent. And the Germans are hesitant to provide concrete evidence—for fear of revealing to the Chinese leadership what they know— for example,
from the work of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND).

https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/

22/26

7/25/2019

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

The BND is trawling the internet for speci c groups of attackers. The agency received 300 million Euros to set up a powerful surveillance system, among other things. The idea is to nd
hacker groups suspected of being government backed and likely to cause damage to the Federal Republic. There is also talk of starting an “intelligence o ensive” against Chinese groups of
attackers. This means: Hacking into the networks. Spies watching spies.

Political espionage?
Corporations like Bayer, Covestro, Roche and Bostik share a single common denominator: the
chemical sector. However, analyses also show that a number of targets now a ected are deviating from the known pattern. We are talking about the possibility of political espionage. We
have come across several indicators corroborating this suspicion.
The Hong Kong government was spied on by the Winnti hackers. We found four infected systems thanks to the network scan, and proceeded to inform the government by email. They
con rm our ndings: “Recently, it was found that six Internet facing computers of two government departments returned positive results from a test for Winnti malware.” The a ected computers did not contain any classi ed information or citizens’ personal data, and there was “no
evidence” that any data have been copied out, we are being told.
The network scan also sni s out a telecommunications provider from India, which happens to
be located precisely in the region where the Tibetan government in exile (the “Central Tibetan
Administration”) has its headquarters. Incidentally, the relevant identi er in the malware is
called “CTA.” A le which ended up on Virustotal in 2018 contained a pretty straightforward
keyword: “tibet”. The CTA didn’t respond to our requests for comment.
On top of this there are campaigns which don’t seem to make a lot of sense unless you consider political espionage. Take Marriott, the hotel chain based in Maryland, USA. The corporation
manages more than one million rooms worldwide. While Marriott hotels may be state-of-theart, who would want to hack Marriott for cutting-edge technologies or innovative ideas? Who
would want to spy on the Indonesian airline Lion Air for the same reasons? Probably nobody.
But hotels and airlines collect data. If you know how to access these data, you know where
people travel and where they spend the night. And if you also hack into telecommunications
companies you know where these people are located at any given time. The Winnti hackers
managed to penetrate the networks of Lion Air and several telecommunications companies,
and they at least did take Marriott into their sights. We have the relevant coded le in our
hands.

Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

When reached for comment, the German government tells us that the security authorities
have established “multiple platforms and discussion groups” for that matter. If required, a ected companies can request “appropriate advice and assistance for cleaning up their systems
and further prevention.” In July 2019 the Federal O ce for Information Security reached out to
a company, whose name was included in a Winnti implant. We were told that “generally speaking foreign intelligence agencies have established cyberattacks as a vital mode of acquiring
more information.” According to the government, these hackers usually don’t have to fear political or economical risks, “due to various obfuscation methods."
The German government’s response is elusive, when asked whether there is a connection between the Winnti hackers and the Chinese Government. They tell us that cyberattacks are taken seriously, no matter who is responsible. We reached out to the Foreign Ministry of China
and the embassy in Berlin with this and other questions. We didn't hear back.
