Famous Banking Applications Now at Risk of Credential Theft
Threat Actors (TAs) commonly promote their malware in cybercrime forums as it enables them to profit
from their illicit activities, enhance their standing among other cybercriminals, and expand the reach of
their malware to a larger audience.
Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) actively monitors cybercrime forums and shares
information whenever a new strain of malware is discovered and advertised by TAs.
CRIL recently discovered an advertisement on a Russian cybercrime forum for an Android banking trojan
called Nexus, offered by a TA. According to the TA, the malware is a new project continuously developed
and compatible with Android versions up to 13.
The below figure shows the TAs advertisement on the cybercrime forum.

applications, as shown below.

Further investigations revealed that the Nexus malware was being distributed through phishing pages
disguised as legitimate websites of YouTube Vanced. The phishing pages included sites such as
youtubeadvanced[.]net and youtubevanvedadw[.]net, among others.
After analyzing the Nexus samples obtained from the phishing pages, it was determined that the
malware’s code shares similarities with that of S.O.V.A banking trojan, which was first discovered in mid2021 and specifically designed to target Android devices. This blog provides a detailed technical
overview of the Nexus Android banking trojan.

We observed a defined launcher activity in the malicious app’s manifest file, which loads the application’s
first screen, as shown in the figure below.

Figure 5 – Launcher Activity
Upon examining the Dex, we found that the components specified in the manifest file were absent. It
suggests that the application has been packed.

After being executed, the malware unpacks the IWGFPqP.json file from the assets section of the APK
file. The unpacked file is then dropped in the application system folder containing the malicious code.

Source Code Review
The malware prompts the user to enable the Accessibility Service upon launching it for the first time.
Once the victim grants this permission, the malware exploits the service to automatically approve
requested permissions, enable device administration, and initiate keylogging activities.
The malware operates surreptitiously by establishing a connection to the Command and Control (C&C)
server via the following URL: hxxp://5.161.97[.]57:5000. Once connected, it transmits sensitive
information, including Accessibility logs and a roster of installed applications to the C&C server as shown
in the below figure.

Figure 8 – Malware Sends Installed Applications List to the C&C Server
Upon receiving the list of installed applications, the command and control (C&C) server verify it against
the targeted list of banking applications. If a match is found, the C&C server sends an “enableinject”
command, including the specific application’s package name, as shown in the code snippet below.

7/14

Figure 9 –

Malware Received the Command from the C&C Server Based on the Target Application
Upon receiving the “enableinject” command from the C&C server, the Nexus banking trojan on the
victim’s device downloads the HTML injection code for the targeted application based on the package
name received. The downloaded HTML injection code is essentially a phishing page for the specific
banking application, which is launched in the WebView interface whenever the victim interacts with the
targeted applications. By utilizing this injection technique, the TA can easily obtain the targeted banking
application credentials.
The below image shows the code of Nexus malware downloading HTML phishing pages.

The Nexus malware can acquire seed phrases from Trust and Exodus wallets and steal wallet balances
by abusing the Accessibility service, as shown in the below code snippet.

Like the SOVA v5 variant, the Nexus malware incorporates a ransomware module that encrypts files
stored on the compromised device.
The figure below illustrates this function.

Conclusion
In the past, TAs had created the fifth iteration of the S.O.V.A. Android banking trojan, which not only
targeted the banking sector but also included a ransomware feature. Now, TAs are advertising a
rebranded version of the S.O.V.A. malware called “Nexus” on cybercrime forums with an updated list of
targeted banks. By exploiting accessibility services, the “Nexus” Android banking Trojan can now target
40 banking applications to steal user credentials.
Cyble Research & Intelligence Labs continuously monitors campaigns. We will keep updating our
readers with the latest information as and when we find it.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:

How to prevent malware infection?
Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App
Store.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such
as PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile
device where possible.
Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone.
Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Be careful while enabling any permissions.
Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.

How to identify whether you are infected?
Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed in mobile devices.
Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions
accordingly.

What to do when you are infected?
Disable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable
the Mobile Data.
Perform a factory reset.
Remove the application in case a factory reset is not possible.
13/14

Take a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.

What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?
In case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank.

What should banks do to protect their customers?
Banks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from
malware attacks via telephone, SMSs, or emails.
