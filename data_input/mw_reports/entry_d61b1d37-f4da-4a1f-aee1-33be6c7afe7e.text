The analysis of phishing campaigns carried out by a new threat actor
In May 2020, Group-IB's network graph — an automated tool for analyzing adversary
infrastructure — first detected domains with an unusual pattern (*kremlin*.duckdns.org) to
which various malicious files were connecting. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution
team examined the domains and identified three phishing campaigns that were used to
deliver various RATs, such as NetWire or AsyncRAT. The campaigns had been active since
2019 and targeted users in Poland, Turkey, Italy, Spain, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan,
Bulgaria, Belarus, Greece, and the Czech Republic.

Analysis of these campaigns revealed that the threat actor used phishing emails with
malicious attachments to gain initial access. Office documents exploiting vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Office products, as well as malicious macros were used as attachments. Group-IB
discovered more than 100 phishing email samples distributed en masse.
Depending on the geographical distribution of the targets the cybercriminals altered the email
contents and language. Phishing emails were accompanied by fake purchasing orders and
other financial documents, used COVID-19 as a theme sometimes and were made to look
like legitimate communications from banks or well-known logistics companies.

The unconventional naming pattern for the domains used to deliver malware (*kremlin,
*crimea, *putin) might be an amateurish attempt to imitate Russian speaking cybercriminals
to throw researchers off track and complicate attribution.
Nevertheless, during further analysis of the adversary infrastructure and the TTPs employed,
as well as a set of malicious software used in conjunction with DDNS services Group-IB
researchers attributed the campaigns with high confidence to a previously unknown threat
actor from Nigeria.
The post examines three threat actor's campaigns carried out in 2019 and 2020, analyzes
the adversary's infrastructure and TTPs and provides recommendations and mitigation
techniques to thwart the threat.
Summer 2020 campaign
The initial list of domains that caught our attention was:
● crimea-kremlin[.]duckdns.org
● kremlin-afghan[.]duckdns.org
● kremlin-crimea[.]duckdns.org
● kremlin-turbo[.]duckdns.org

3/20

These domains were registered to the same IP address (79.134.225[.]43) on June 15, 2020.
According to the Group-IB network graph, there are about 30 different malicious files
associated with these four domains. The decoys found suggest that the campaign targeted
users in Poland, Turkey, Italy, Germany, and Bulgaria.

Malicious infrastructure identified by Group-IB's graph
Further analysis showed that most of the files had been uploaded to public sources from
June 25, 2020. The most common names were "Potwierdzenie transakcji.xls", "İşlem
makbuzu", "WACKER - 000160847.xls", and "Potwierdzenie operacji.xls". One of these files
(SHA1: 95A6A416F682A9D254E76EC38ADE01CE241B3366) is a decoy document in
Polish supposedly sent from one of the local banks.

After the macros in this document are enabled, a PowerShell script is executed to extract the
second-stage command from the lab.jpg file located on a remote server:

Executable PS script from a macro
The lab.jpg file contains a Base64-encoded command that, after being decoded, looks as
follows:

Deobfuscated contents of lab.jpg

This code reads the contents of the file http://officeservicecorp[.]biz/rnp.txt, which contains a
payload.
As a result of this sequence of PowerShell scripts, the infamous NetWire RAT is loaded and
executed. The tool connects to its C&C server (kremlin-crimea[.]duckdns.org) on port 3396.

NetWire RAT configuration
If we insert the original domains into the graph in increments of 2, we will see not only these
domains, but also the rest of the associated infrastructure that was involved in all the
infection stages.

It is interesting to note that files that connected office-service-tech[.]info also performed
network connections to ahjuric[.]si. One of these files (SHA1
a3816c37d0fbe26a87d1cc7beff91ce5816039e7) was a decoy document in Turkish with the
logo of a state-owned bank in Turkey.

A decoy document targeting Turkish users. SHA1:
a3816c37d0fbe26a87d1cc7beff91ce5816039e7
This document contains a malicious macro that executes a PowerShell script. The latter
reads Code.txt from a remote server and runs a chain of obfuscated PS scripts.
Contents of ahjuric[.]si/code.txt

Executing the obfuscated PS script leads to another Base64-encoded script being executed.
The latter will ultimately execute the payload in the form of NetWire RAT from office-servicetech[.]info/pld.txt.

The C&C server of this sample is crimea-kremlin.duckdns[.]org.
We also found files that make network connections simultaneously to kremlinturbo.duckdns[.]org and wshsoft[.]company. The latter domain name brings to mind the WSH
RAT, which is based on the Houdini code. One of these files (SHA1:
b42a3b8c6d53a28a2dc84042d95ce9ca6e09cbcf) is a RAT sample that sends requests such
as /is-ready to the C&C server kremlin-turbo.duckdns[.]org:3397. WSHRAT is indicated as its
UA.

At this stage, it is important to note that some of the domains used in this campaign were
registered to the email address tetragulf@yahoo[.]com.

Spring 2020 campaign
While examining all other related infrastructure, we came across domains registered to
asetonly@yahoo[.]com. Since early 2020, the following domains have been registered to this
email address:
1. nitro-malwrhunterteams[.]com
2. office-data-labs[.]com
3. putin-malwrhunterteams[.]com
4. kremlin-malwrhunterteam[.]info
5. skidware-malwrhunterteams[.]com
6. screw-malwrhunterteams[.]com

8. office-services-labs[.]com
9. office-cloud-reserve[.]com
10. office-clean-index[.]com
11. office-cleaner-indexes[.]com
We collected over 130 different malware samples from various sources associated with
these domains. Judging by the names and content of these samples, the spring 2020
campaign targeted users in Europe and CIS countries. Group-IB experts uncovered decoy
documents in Ukrainian, Belarusian, Kazakh, Russian and Greek.
The campaign's first files were uploaded to public sandboxes on March 23, 2020. One of
these files was named "Аналіз проекту.docx" (SHA1d8826efc7c0865c873330a25d805c95c9e64ad05) and was distributed as an attachment to
the email "Електронна розсилка_ Змінене замовлення.eml" (SHA17f1fdf605e00323c055341919173a7448e3641fb), which was uploaded to VirusTotal via a
web interface from Ukraine.

Contents of the email "Електронна розсилка_ Змінене замовлення.eml"

The document's content doesn't spark much interest and looks like a scanned invoice.
However, the document exploits the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, which executes a
command that loads the payload http://office-cloud-reserve[.]com/hydro.exe.

Another analyzed file (SHA1- 19324fc16f99a92e737660c4737a41df044ecc54) called
"Байланысорталықтары.img" was distributed as an attachment to COVID-19-themed emails
(SHA1: 403c0f9a210f917e88d20d97392d9b1b14cbe310) in Kazakh.

This attachment is an .iso image. In some cases, it is named "Байланыс орталықтары.img".
The file is mounted to the system as an image which contains one obfuscated VBS file
(SHA1: fd274f57e59c8ae3e69e0a4eb59a06ee8fd74f91) named "Денсаулық сақтау
бойынша анықтамалық жəнедеректер базасы.vbs". The file is a loader that executes an
obfuscated PS code. After that, the file http://office-cleaner-indexes[.]com/loud.jpg is read.

Contents of the dropped file SHA1:fd274f57e59c8ae3e69e0a4eb59a06ee8fd74f91
As a result, AgentTesla is loaded and executed, which also exfiltrates the data through
ftp.centredebeautenellycettier[.]fr
Another document (SHA1: c992e0a46185bf0b089b3c4261e4faff15a5bc15) named
"Συμφωνία 060520.xls" was distributed via email in Greek. Its content looks the same as all
others in this campaign, but in Greek. Its NanoCore Rat payload connects to screwmalwrhunterteams[.]com.

Contents of the decoy document "Συμφωνία 060520.xls"
2019 campaign
Further analysis of the infrastructure related to tetragulf@yahoo[.]com revealed that in 2019
only four domains were registered to this email address, two of which were registered in late
February and were involved in one campaign distributing malicious documents.

Most of these files are RTF documents that exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, while
others are the executable payload. While investigating this campaign, we found emails and
decoys in Ukrainian, Russian, Greek, Spanish, and Czech.

Network communication of the file SHA1: 443c079b24d65d7fd74392b90c0eac4aab67060c
(according to Group-IB's network graph data)
We found this host interesting and uncovered additional files that established network
connections to http://68.235.38[.]157. Some of these files, "Estos son los documentos
adjuntos de junio.doc" (SHA1: 02799b41c97b6205f1999a72cef8b8991d4b8092) and "New
Order.doc" (SHA1: 25abf0f75c56516134436c1f836d9db1e770ff30), exploit vulnerability
CVE-2017-11882. At startup, they establish a connection to http://68.235.38[.]157/oyii.hta.

17/20

Contents of http://68.235.38[.]157/oyii.hta
This file contains a Visual Basic code, which performs a Base64-encoded PowerShell
command to download payload from the public file storage system
https://m.put[.]re/Qm8He5E4.exe (SHA1: 523c5e0a1c9bc6d28f08500e96319571b57e4ba7)
and stores it to the temp directory under the name "avantfirewall.exe".

Executable PowerShell script
The payload reads the content from https://paste[.]ee/r/rSrae, which results in the Async RAT
being executed. The tool connects to the C&C server kizzoyi.duckdns[.]org on port 8808.
Another document from this campaign is named "таблиці.doc" (SHA11230acfd1f6f5b13a218ff8658a835997d1f0774). It was distributed via emails in Ukrainian.
