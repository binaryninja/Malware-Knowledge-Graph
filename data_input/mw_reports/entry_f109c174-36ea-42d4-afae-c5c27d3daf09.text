Summary
BlackCat (a.k.a. ALPHV and Noberus) is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group that
emerged in November 2021, making headlines for being a sophisticated ransomware written
in Rust. It has both Windows and Linux variants and the payload can be customized to adapt
to the attacker’s needs. BlackCat is also believed to be the successor of the Darkside and
BlackMatter ransomware groups. They work with a double-extortion scheme, where data is
stolen, encrypted, and leaked if the ransom isn’t paid, which is a common methodology
implemented by RaaS groups.
According to Microsoft, BlackCat was found targeting different countries and regions in
Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe, having at least two known affiliates: DEV-0237
(previously associated with Ryuk, Conti, and Hive), and DEV-0504 (previously associated
with Ryuk, REvil, BlackMatter, and Conti). However, due to the diversity of affiliates and
targets, BlackCat may present different TTPs across the attacks. Recently, in September
2022, BlackCat claimed to have breached a contractor that provides services to the U.S.
Department of Defense and other government agencies.

In this blog post, we will analyze BlackCat and show some of the tactics and techniques we
found in a recent ransomware incident analyzed by Netskope Threat Labs. The evidence
shows that this was a targeted attack, where the attackers were mainly focused on stealing
sensitive data from the organization and infecting as many devices as possible.

Initial Foothold and Lateral Movements
In a recent incident analyzed by Netskope Threat Labs, the attackers breached a contractor
who had access to a virtual desktop machine within the corporate network.
The attacker used a malicious browser extension to capture the contractor’s account. Since
there was no MFA required, the attacker was able to login to the virtual desktop, escalate
privileges, and move to other devices in the corporate network.

Payload Execution
After scanning the corporate network, BlackCat attackers created multiple text files, each
one containing the names of identified machines in the network.

Files with names of machines

identified by the attackers.
Then, they used PsExec and a compromised domain account to deploy ExMatter to more
than 2,000 machines in the network.

2/24

Details of PsExec binary used by BlackCat attackers.
The attackers used batch files to execute multiple PsExec commands to deploy payloads to
the identified machines.

Batch file executed by BlackCat attacker.
Below is an example of the command line executed by the attacker to remotely execute
commands and payloads using PsExec and the compromised account:
start PsExec.exe -d -n 5 @C:\temp\list01.txt -accepteula -u <REDACTED_USER> -p
<REDACTED_PASSWORD> cmd /c <COMMAND_LINE>
The description for the PsExec arguments used by the attacker can be found below:
Argument

Description

-d

Don't wait for process to terminate (non-interactive)

3/24

Argument

Description

-n 5

Wait 5 seconds when connecting to remote computers

@C:\temp\list01.txt

File containing the names of the computers in which PsExec will
execute the command

-accepteula

Automatically accept the EULA to avoid displaying the dialog

-u

Username of the compromised account used by the attacker

-p

Password of the compromised account used by the attacker

cmd /c

Command-line executed by the attacker

Among other evidence, it’s possible to confirm whether PsExec was successfully executed in
a device by checking the following registry key.

by PsExec when the tool is executed.

Data Exfiltration
In this incident, the attackers used a .NET data exfiltration tool known as ExMatter, which
was the same tool used by BlackMatter ransomware and recently adopted by BlackCat. It’s
worth mentioning that the server used for data exfiltration in this incident was stood up by the
attackers one day before the attack.
The specific sample from this incident was compiled close to the attack and contains a
popular .NET protection named Confuser.

4/24

Some details about the ExMatter tool used by BlackCat attackers.
The attacker tried to deploy this tool to over 2,000 machines in the network using PsExec,
like described earlier. ExMatter will iterate over the drives of infected machines to search for
files that will be exfiltrated.

Logs from the

ExMatter tool used by BlackCat.
As described earlier, this tool was recently updated by BlackCat, containing code refactoring
and new functionalities. Despite the code changes, we can clearly observe similarities
between a known ExMatter sample and the tool used in this attack.

5/24

Comparing a known ExMatter tool with the binary found in the attack.
ExMatter contains a list with details about the types of files it will try to exfiltrate and
directories to avoid. Also, this tool is only stealing files between 4 KB and 64 MB.

6/24

Types of

files ExMatter will try to exfiltrate.
It will not exfiltrate data from the following directories:
AppData\Local\Microsoft
AppData\Local\Packages
AppData\Roaming\Microsoft
C:$Recycle.Bin
C:\Documents and Settings
C:\PerfLogs
C:\Program Files
C:\Program Files (x86)

7/24

C:\ProgramData
C:\Users\All Users\Microsoft
C:\Windows

ExMatter skipping directories from the pre-

defined list.
As previously mentioned, it will only exfiltrate files that contains the following extensions and
are within the file size threshold:
*.bmp
*.doc
*.docx
*.dwg
*.ipt
*.jpeg
*.jpg
*.msg
*.pdf
*.png
*.pst
*.rdp
*.rtf
*.sql
*.txt
*.txt
*.xls
*.xlsx
*.zip

8/24

ExMatter function that searches for files to exfiltrate.
By default, this specific sample is trying to communicate with an IP address via WebDav,
initially sending a PROPFIND request.

The WebDav methods implemented by this tool are: PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL,
COPY, MOVE, LOCK, and UNLOCK.

methods implemented in ExMatter.
This tool can also be executed in background (without showing the console) if “background” or “-b” is specified.

Checking if the

“background” parameter was specified.

Data Encryption
Like the ExMatter tool, the BlackCat payload was also compiled in July 2022. The attackers
deployed the ransomware to over 2,000 machines with the same technique described earlier,
by using PsExec with a compromised domain account.

At this point, two versions of BlackCat’s encryptor were found in the wild. The first one was
storing the ransomware’s configuration in plain-text within the binary, which could be easily
extracted and parsed. The second one started to encrypt the configuration, where the
decryption key is passed via an argument named “access token”. In other words, the latest
version of BlackCat cannot be executed or have its configuration extracted if the access
token is unknown.
The version used in this specific attack is the latest one, which can be confirmed by running
the sample without the access key or with an random key, generating an “invalid config”
error.

BlackCat cannot be executed

without the correct token created by the attacker.
Once running, the access key is then parsed and used to decrypt the configuration in
runtime, using AES-128.

BlackCat also contains a “self propagation” functionality (worm), by using PsExec and
compromised credentials specified in the configuration. The PsExec binary is encrypted and
stored within the ransomware executable.

There’s also an option named “drag-and-drop”, which creates a batch file that can be used to
execute the ransomware. The content of this file is decrypted at runtime.

Batch

file created by BlackCat.
Additional commands ran by BlackCat:
1. Get device UUID
“C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” /c “wmic csproduct get UUID”
2. Stop IIS service
“C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” /c “iisreset.exe /stop”
3. Clean shadow copies
“C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” /c “vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /all /quiet”
“C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” /c “wmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete”
4. List Windows event logs names and try to clear them all.
“C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” /c “wevtutil.exe el”
“C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” /c “wevutil.exe cl \”<NameHere>\”
In this attack, we noticed that the attacker listed all the logs with the correct binary (wevtutil),
but there’s a typo in the commands that actually clear the logs (wevutil). In other words, the
attacker failed to clean the Windows event logs.
20/24

Typo in command line executed by the ransomware.
This ransomware encrypts files using AES or ChaCha20 depending on the configuration,
and the key used to encrypt the file is encrypted with a public RSA key contained within its
configuration.
Once done, the extension defined in the configuration is appended to encrypted files and,
like other ransomware, BlackCat created the ransom note with information about the attack
and contact instructions.

21/24

If enabled in the configuration, the ransomware also changes the user’s wallpaper with the
following message.

BlackCat’s Website
Like other RaaS groups operating in the double-extortion scheme, BlackCat maintains a
website hosted on the deep web where they leak stolen data if the ransom isn’t paid by the
victims.

BlackCat “collections” website.
They are likely the first ransomware group that allows you to search leaked data through
keywords, even supporting wildcards.

Conclusions
BlackCat and other Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) groups often exploit basic flaws in
security policies and network architecture to infect as many devices as possible, stealing and
encrypting data to extort organizations and individuals. As demonstrated in this analysis,
these groups often use legitimate tools throughout the attack, such as PsExec.

22/24

We strongly recommend companies revisit password policies and avoid using default
passwords for new accounts. Technologies such as Microsoft LAPS can help to generate
unique passwords for local administrator accounts. Implementing a security policy to enforce
multi-factor authentication and using strong passwords for domain accounts is also
recommended.
Implementing strong monitoring and blocking known tools like PsExec can also help the
security of your organization. User training is also strongly recommended as social
engineering could be exploited by these groups to gain access to networks. Lastly, we also
recommend using a secure web gateway to protect your network against malware and data
exfiltration.
