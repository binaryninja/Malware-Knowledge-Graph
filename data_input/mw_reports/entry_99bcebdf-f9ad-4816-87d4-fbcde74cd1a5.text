A recent cyber-attack reported within the South Korean broadcasting and banking infrastructure
reportedly brought down over 35,000 systems. This attack has drawn comparisons in intent and
method to the recent wiping attack against Saudi Aramco by the Shamoon malware. Shamoon
has been covered extensively by the community, and was covered in Fidelis Threat Advisory
#1007. Naturally our curiosity was peaked and we acquired samples of the malware and started
analysis.
The initial analysis has been posted on the Fidelis Threat Geek blog and will be expanded upon
in this advisory. This write-up will focus on the wiper malware used and the recovery techniques
that are possible.
From preliminary analysis it is known that the malware will overwrite the Master Boot Record
(MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR). The records and files overwritten by the malware so far
have been wiped with patterns of 'HASTATI' or 'PR!NCPES’.
The malware samples that have been analyzed by our team are different in code and function
from the Shamoon malware. However, by using the same recovery methods found in advisory
#1007 the files and data are indeed recoverable.

Wiper Malware Overview
Two malware samples obtained were used in the analysis. The malware has been named
'DarkSeoul' and 'Jokra' by the community.
Our samples have been touched on in our blog entry and other samples have been covered in
blogs around the community.

The malware gains disk access by opening the physical drive as a file.
Disk Access (Func 00401d55):
sprintf(filename_str, "\\.\PhysicalDrive%d", 0)
hFile = CreateFileA(filename_str, GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE, NULL,
OPEN_EXISTING, NULL)
Example of the wiper opening the drive as a file.

The first section that the malware overwrites is located at 0x7000. This is sector 56 and is
normally the VBR location of a Windows XP system. It continues the pattern of 'HASTATI' or
'PR!NCPES’' for 102,400d bytes.
Wiper Selection (Func 00402079):
and [local.1], 0
;(local.1->"PR!NCPES")
mov esi,[arg.2] ;arg.2 = 0x38 on first call
eax=0
shld eax,esi,9
mov edi,[arg.1]
mov [arg.2], eax
lea eax, [arg.2]
shl esi,9
SetFilePointer(hFile, esi, eax, FILE_BEGIN) // on first call -- 0x009efab8:0x00007000
WriteFile(hFile, &arg.3, 512, &local.1, NULL)
Example of how the wiper selected the location to overwrite on the first call.

If this is hardcoded for 0x7000 then it will not wipe the VBR of any systems after and including
Vista, as those VBR locations are in different areas.
During testing both malware samples were executed in a Windows 7 VM. Neither wiped the MBR
or the VBR—they only overwrote files within the file system—but the system wasn't prevented
from starting up.
The malware writes a 512-byte pattern to the disk in XP and a 1023 byte pattern in Windows 7.

Example of the loop responsible for overwriting the disk and files.

As observed during a debugging session the following screenshot shows one of the 512-byte
patterns it writes to disk:

Example of overwritten disk

The malware will create new threads for each physical drive found on the affected system. It
enumerates and tries to find PhysicalDrive[0-9]. The malware makes distinctions based on what
type of drive is detected, such as fixed or removable devices. As long as the drive is fixed a new
thread is created.
Thread 1 (Func 00401aa0):
call func_00401d55
strcpy(drive_path, "B:\")
...
if (GetDriveType(drive_path) == DRIVE_FIXED)
CreateThread(NULL, 0, 00401B7A, 0040247C, 0, &tid)
...
Example of the wiper finds fixed drives and create new thread for each drive.

The following commands have previously been reported in the community:
“taskkill /F /IM pasvc.exe”
“taskkill /F /IM Clisvc.exe”
"shutdown -r -t 0"
Example of commands run by the malware.

The first command, “taskkill /F /IM pasvc.exe”, will try to kill a process named “pasvc.exe”. This
process is associated with the AhnLab Policy Agent process.

The second command, “taskkill /F /IM Clisvc.exe”, will try to kill a process named “Clisvc.exe”.
This process is associated with the ViRobot ISMS security tool from HAURI Inc.
The third command, “shutdown -r -t 0”, instructs the malware to shutdown and reboot the system.
The malware shuts the system down quickly after initial execution, it was found to finish wiping in
ten to fifteen minutes in our tests. Due to the speed of the wiping it was very easy to find that the
malware did not actually wipe all the data on the computer. It wiped just enough to make the
machine unusable after the operation was complete. This is notable and can be seen in the
operation of the malware as it makes sure to overwrite the VBR first then continue overwriting the
MBR and other files.
Note: The sample Fidelis Security Systems researchers had available looked very similar to that
detailed in community write-ups. However, as of the date of this post, researchers were still
analyzing the available sample. Therefore, differences between the available sample and others
available to the community may become apparent in the future.

File System Recovery
The following is the view of the wiped disk for each of the operating systems that we tested:

Example of wiped MBR by the Malware.

The malware never actually overwrote the backup VBR. It was found that the same techniques
utilized to recover data from Shamoon could be applied here. The recovery methods were
covered in depth in Fidelis Threat Advisory #1007 so we will not show them here. What will be
shown are the results of the recovery.
When the backup VBR is found within EnCase (v6.19.6) it was possible to add a manual NTFS
partition into the system to recover the file system and data within.

Example of a file system recovered

Once the logical file system is recovered relevant forensic artifacts can be located. It will be
important to note that a lot of files will be recoverable and a lot of system files are left untouched.
The wiper corrupts file systems very quickly, but the expense of this is leaving more files
untouched and recoverable.
Note: When multiple partitions are suspected then it will be likely the recovery will need to be
done manually with a hex editor. The method for this was also covered in advisory #1007.
Using a hex editor it is possible to repair an image with the backup VBR and build a new MBR to
boot the affected computer. This comes with a warning, just being able to boot the machine and
accessing the data within doesn't mean that system will operate properly. The system still has
files that were corrupted by the malware, and some of those files will affect the user experience.
However, in our testing we were able to rebuild the MBR and recover the VBR to boot the
affected system.
Our repaired system was missing the start button and a few of the shortcuts to executables on
the desktop were no longer functioning. The XP system when repaired always asked to complete
a chkdisk cycle, and on the whole didn’t operate normally. The Windows 7 systems that were
affected by the two malware samples did not experience these issues, and appeared to operate
normally. Attempts to repair the XP system with the windows recovery CD always ended in a
bluescreen error before the operation finished any repairing.

The Fidelis Take
Fidelis XPS sensors detect the DarkSeoul/Jokra malware as it enters the network as
"Trojan.Win32.EraseMBR.b". Fidelis XPS is capable of detecting this threat regardless of delivery
method employed by the Threat Actors responsible. Fidelis XPS can detect and alert on
executables such as the DarkSeoul malware multiple layers deep inside of zip files, or even
XOR'ed inside of a weaponized MS Office document or Adobe PDF File. The Fidelis Threat
Research and Network Forensics and Incident Response teams will continue to actively monitor
the ever-evolving threat landscape for the latest threats to our customers network security.
