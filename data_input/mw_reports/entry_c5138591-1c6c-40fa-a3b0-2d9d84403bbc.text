We recently caught a malvertising attack distributing the malware Glupteba. This is an older malware that was previously connected to a campaign named Operation
Windigo and distributed through exploit kits to Windows users. In 2018, a security company reported that the Glupteba botnet may have been independent from
Operation Windigo and had moved to a pay-per-install adware service to distribute it in the wild. The activities of the actors behind Glupteba have been varied: they
were suspected of providing proxy services in the underground, and were identiﬁed as using the EternalBlue exploit to move into local networks and run Monero
(XMR) cryptocurrency miners.
After looking into the recent variant of the Glupteba dropper delivered from the malvertising attack, we found that the dropper downloaded two undocumented
components aside from the Glupteba malware:
A browser stealer that can steal sensitive data, for example, browsing history, website cookies, and account names and passwords from browsers and send the
information to a remote server.
A router exploiter that attacks MikroTik routers in local network with the CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability. It will schedule a task on the router for command and
control (C&C) and upload the stolen administrator credentials to a remote server. A compromised router will be conﬁgured as a SOCKS proxy to relay
malicious trafﬁc, matching the original purpose of the Glupteba botnet on Windows.
In addition, an interesting feature we found inside the Glupteba dropper can retrieve the latest C&C domain from Bitcoin transactions. We explain this feature further
in the next sections. It seems the operators are still improving their malware and may be trying to extend their proxy network to internet of things (IoT) devices.

Analysis of the Glupteba dropper
The downloaded dropper binary is packed with a custom packer, written in Go programming language, and compiled to executable. The dropper ﬁrst initializes
‘conﬁg information’ by acquiring current application information, operating information, hardware information, as well as some information hardcoded in binary. It

creates a registry key HKEY_USERS\<sid>\Software\Microsoft\TestApp to store all the acquired information. The result of running the conﬁg initialization function
is shown in the ﬁgure below.

Figure 3. Registries created by the Glupteba dropper
Then, the function sendParentProcesses acquires machine_guid from the registry, as well as distributor id and campaign id from the ﬁle name, product identiﬁcation
(PID), and names of parent processes. It then embeds this information in a POST request, encrypts it with an AES cipher, and uploads to the C&C server:
hxxps://<server>/api/parent-processes.
After that, the dropper checks if process is elevated and running as a SYSTEM user. If process is not elevated, it tries to exploit the fodhelper method to get it
elevated. If it is elevated but not running as a SYSTEM user, it uses the “Run as Trusted Installer” method, likely inspired by this code, which uses a stolen winlogon
process token to run process as SYSTEM.
The main dropper binary has embedded a few rootkit drivers used for hiding ﬁles and processes (WinMon32.sys, WinMon64.sys, WinMonFs32.sys,
WinMonFs64.sys, WinMonprocessmonitor32.sys, WinMonProcessMonitor64.sys, WinmonSystemMonitor-10-64.sys, WinmonSystemMonitor-7-10-32.sys,
WinmonSystemMonitor-7-64.sys) and a few other tools taken from GitHub used to help installing the necessary drivers (dseﬁx.exe and patch.exe.)
Function executeTask processes these main commands:
hide
update
cleanup

Hide task PID using embedded WinMon
Terminate and remove current version, replace with new version
Uninstall

Function mainInstall checks for installed antivirus (AV) programs, adds ﬁrewall rules, and adds defender exclusions.
Function mainPoll regularly polls the C&C server for new commands. It sends a POST request to hxxps://<server>/api/poll. POST parameters look like the following
(before encryption):
challenge=e94e354daf5f48ca&cloudnet_ﬁle=1&cloudnet_process=1&lcommand=0&mrt=1&pgdse=0&sb=1&sc=0&uuid=&version=145&wup_process=1&wup
The query is AES 256-encrypted.
Finally, function handleCommand implements backdoor functions.

Update C2
Use hardcoded Electrum wallet; read blockchain transaction data
Use hardcoded Bitcoin address, discover new C2 domain encrypted in
bitcoin transaction data

Notable C&C update capability
The backdoor mostly has standard capabilities, but one interesting feature stands out: This malware can update its C&C server address through the blockchain via the
function discoverDomain.
The discoverDomain function can be run either by sending a backdoor command, or automatically by the dropper. DiscoverDomain ﬁrst enumerates Electrum
Bitcoin wallet servers using a publicly available list, then tries to query the blockchain script hash history of the script with a hardcoded hash.

This command then reveals all the related transactions.

Then each transaction is parsed, searching for the OP_RETURN instruction.

The pieces of data followed by OP_RETURN instruction are then used as parameters for AES decryption routine — the ﬁrst 12 bytes are used as the AES GCM tag,
and the following 32 bytes are the encrypted data. The 32-byte long AES key is hardcoded in binary ﬁle.

Therefore, 0f8f7cd39e1a5231b49f986b877befce0c2f558f0c1a9844833ac702cb3eba6e gets decoded to venoxcontrol[.]com, which is the current C&C server at the
time of writing this publication.
This technique makes it more convenient for the threat actor to replace C&C servers. If they lose control of a C&C server for any reason, they simply need to add a
new Bitcoin script and the infected machines obtain a new C&C server by decrypting the script data and reconnecting.
Browser stealer component
One observed component from the recent Glupteba variant is called “updateproﬁle”, which is a browser proﬁle, cookies, and password extractor. The Chrome, Opera,
and Yandex browsers are targeted — cookies, history, and other proﬁle ﬁles are zipped and uploaded to the information collection server to path /api/log. Similar to
the main dropper, this component is also written in Go, compiled to be executable, and packed with a UPX packer.
Another version of the browser stealer is called “vc.exe”. Its goal is to extract browser passwords and cookies and post the extracted data to the information collection
server to path /bots/post-en-data?uuid=.
Router exploiter component
Another component we found downloaded by the Glupteba dropper is a router exploiter, which is also developed with Go language. It looks into the default gateway
of the victim’s network. The list of default IP gateways is obtained by calling WMI command “SELECT DefaultIPGateway FROM
Win32_NetworkAdapterConﬁguration WHERE IPEnabled = true”.
In addition to these addresses, the following three default addresses are added: 192.168.88.11, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1.

Once the component successfully connects to the device listening on port 8291, it then attempts to exploit the device with the CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability, which
affects the RouterOS system used on MikroTik routers. The exploit code was likely inspired by this code on exploit-db. It allows the attackers to grab the
administrator’s credentials from unpatched routers. The grabbed account names and passwords are stored in a JSON object, encrypted, and POSTed to /api/router
path of the C&C server.

Once credentials are successfully obtained, a task is added to the scheduler of the router. There are three methods implemented to add a scheduler task: using WinBox
protocol, using SSH, or using API.

Figure 4. Example of scheduled task added by Glupteba campaign to compromised MikroTik routers
The router exploiter component scheduled a task named “U6” on compromised routers for command and control. The task will regularly check a C&C URL every 10
minutes and execute the content downloaded from it. The C&C URL is appended with a unique UUID, which is the same as the bot ID of Glupteba on the victim’s
machine. The URL usually returns an HTTP 404 error; but when the bot master sends a command, it returns an RSC ﬁle, which is the format of the RouterOS
conﬁguration.
The ﬁle is the command from the bot master to control the router. In the attack we analyzed, we saw the C&C server send multiple RSC ﬁles step by step to conﬁgure
the compromised router to be a SOCKS proxy. Here are the steps:
The ﬁrst conﬁguration changed the period of “U6” task schedule from 10 minutes to every 15 seconds.

The second conﬁguration disabled services, including winbox, telnet, api, and api-ssl. This is most likely to prevent the router from being compromised by
other attackers through the same vulnerability. Then it opened the SSH and SOCKS services, which are listening on randomly assigned ports, and created a
ﬁrewall rule to accept external connection to the SOCKS port.

The third conﬁguration removed the existing SOCKS access list on the compromised router.

The fourth conﬁguration added a new SOCKS access list to limit the service so that it only accepts connections from speciﬁed IP ranges. These ranges are
probably where the attackers’ servers are.

Relayed trafﬁc on compromised routers
After the above-mentioned setups, the compromised router became a SOCKS proxy for the attackers to relay trafﬁc. We monitored a compromised router to see what
kind of trafﬁc is transferred. The ﬁrst remote connection routed through the SOCKS proxy is from a server, which likely belongs to the attackers. This server queries
“http://ip-api[.]com/json”, which returns the IP address of the current SOCKS proxy server. This query is sent repeatedly, probably to monitor the SOCKS proxy
service.
After the ﬁrst check on the router status, we started seeing different servers with two types of trafﬁc connected to the proxy. The ﬁrst one is spam trafﬁc. We saw a
remote server establish SMTP connections to different mail servers through the SOCKS proxy of compromised routers. If a mail server accepted the connection, that
remote server started to send spam mail. The spam mail delivered seems to be related to the notorious “Canadian Pharmacy” spam.

Besides the spam trafﬁc, we saw other trafﬁc from a set of remote servers that were repeatedly connecting to Instagram. However, the trafﬁc sent through was
protected by HTTPS encryption. We can’t decrypt it and don’t know what exactly these connections are for. One theory is that it is the password-reuse attack hitting
Instagram. It was previously reported to be one type of malicious trafﬁc proxied through the Glupteba botnet.

As mentioned, Glupteba still seems to be evolving and adding capabilities. New techniques, such as updating C&C servers through data obtained from Bitcoin
transactions, show that the malicious actors behind this malware are adopting little-used techniques to try and keep their malware active. Since it is already proven to
be an information stealer and a proxy for malicious spam, users and enterprises should be wary of this threat.
Security recommendations
Malvertising is a widespread threat that can affect users and businesses alike. A multilayered approach to security is important — from the gateway, endpoints,
networks, and servers. Trend Micro solutions powered by XGen™ security, such as Trend Micro™ Security and Trend Micro Network Defense, can detect related
malicious ﬁles and URLs and protect users’ systems. Trend Micro Smart Protection Suites and Trend Micro Worry-Free™ Business Security, which have behavior
monitoring capabilities, can additionally protect from these types of threats by detecting malicious ﬁles, as well as blocking all related malicious URLs.
Security should be top of mind when setting up routers — most devices across homes and ofﬁces are connected to these devices and can be affected if a router is
compromised. Although manufacturers play important roles in securing routers and other devices, users and businesses can adopt good security practices to defend
against threats. Also, deploying tools that provide additional security to home networks and devices connected to them further strengthens defenses.
