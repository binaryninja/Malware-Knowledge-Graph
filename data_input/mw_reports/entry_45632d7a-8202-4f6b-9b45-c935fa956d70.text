Car manufacturer Honda has been hit by a cyber attack, according to a report published by
the BBC, and later confirmed by the company in a tweet. Another similar attack, also
disclosed on Twitter, hit Edesur S.A., one of the companies belonging to Enel Argentina
which operates in the business of energy distribution in the City of Buenos Aires.
Based on samples posted online, these incidents may be tied to the EKANS/SNAKE
ransomware family. In this blog post, we review what is known about this ransomware strain
and what we have been able to analyze so far.

Honda Ransomware Attack with a liking for ICS
First public mentions of EKANS ransomware date back to January 2020, with security
researcher Vitali Kremez sharing information about a new targeted ransomware written in
GOLANG.
The group appears to have a special interest for Industrial Control Systems (ICS), as
detailed in this blog post by security firm Dragos.

On June 8, a researcher shared samples of ransomware that supposedly was aimed at
Honda and ENEL INT. When we started looking at the code, we found several artefacts that
corroborate this possibility.

Figure 2: Mutex check
When the malware executes, it will try to resolve to a hardcoded hostname
(mds.honda.com). If, and only if it does, will the file encryption begin. The same logic, with a
specific hostname, also applied to the ransomware allegedly tied to Enel.

RDP as a possible attack vector
Both companies had some machines with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access publicly
exposed (reference here). RDP attacks are one of the main entry points when it comes to
targeted ransomware opertaions.

However, we cannot say conclusively that this is how threat actors may have gotten in.
Ultimately, only a proper internal investigation will be able to determine exactly how the
attackers were able to compromise the affected networks.

Detection
We tested the ransomware samples publicly available in our lab by creating a fake internal
server that would respond to the DNS query made by the malware code with the same IP
address it expected. We then ran the sample alleged to be tied to Honda against
Malwarebytes Nebula, our cloud-based endpoint protection for businesses.

We detect this payload as ‘Ransom.Ekans’ when it attempts to execute. In order to test
another of our protection layers, we also disabled (not recommended) the malware
protection to let the behavior engine do its thing. Our anti-ransomware technology was able
to quarantine the malicious file without the use of any signature.
Ransomware gangs have shown no mercy, even in this period of dealing with a pandemic.
They continue to target big companies in order to extort large sums of money.
RDP has been called out as some of the lowest hanging fruit preferred by attackers.
However, we also recently learned about a new SMB vulnerability allowing remote execution.
It is important for defenders to properly map out all assets, patch them, and never allow them
to be publicly exposed.
We will update this blog post if we come across new relevant information.
