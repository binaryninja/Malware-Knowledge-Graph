Criminals Continuously Experimented & Improved
During our 12 month observation, the attackers went through many rounds of redesign and
continuous improvement. Let’s look at two, for a full discussion refer to our report.

Concluding Remarks and Takeaways
• Blockchain-based C&C is the next step in a long evaluation of criminal TTPs,
but it will be very difficult to mitigate this technique in the future
• We could study how the adversaries experimented, learned and improved their TTPs over
time, and traded off performance with how much they had to pay for it

• A simple design mistake allowed us to takeover their operation until they redesigned,
but eventually they dropped their use of the Bitcoin blockchain for C&C coordination
• This mechanism was ingenious, however, vulnerable to Bitcoin (fees) surge which cut their
profit, as the result, they gave up when the cost was not worth it
• After evading our takeover, we could track their malicious activity by monitoring Bitcoin
behavior
