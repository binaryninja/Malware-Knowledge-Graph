Wave of Phishing Attacks

Cyble’s research team has found an uptick in phishing campaigns targeting multiple
organizations, including financial institutes, by abusing the ngrok platform, a secure and
introspectable tunnel to the localhost.
About ngrok: ngrok is a cross-platform application used to expose a local development
server to the internet, and it makes the locally hosted server appear to be hosted on a
subdomain of ngrok(e.g., 4f421deb219c[.]ngrok[.]io) by creating a long-lived TCP tunnel to
the localhost. The ngrok server software is self-hosted on a VPS or a dedicated server. It has
the ability to bypass NAT mapping and Firewall restriction.
Multiple threat actors have abused the ngrok platform to gain unauthorized access to the
target for delivering the additional payload, exfiltrating financial data such as credit/debit card
information, and carrying out targeted phishing attacks.
The ngrok-based cyberattacks are harder to detect since they use random subdomains of
ngrok.com, besides bypassing security devices like Firewall, thereby making it an active
target for cybercriminals.

History of ngrok-based attacks:
In 2019, cybercriminals abused ngrok tunnelling hosted on AWS to deliver Lokibot.

Last year, the Fox Kitten APT group targeted the private and government sector in the
U.S. The threat group was known for using ngrok to intrude on-premises BIG-IP
devices.
In September 2020, researchers identified the Pioneer kitten APT group, an Iran-based
Threat group abusing the ngrok platform. The group was selling compromised
corporate credentials on cybercrime forums.
Investigation:
Some of the new strains of malware / phishing campaign using ngrok tunnelling are:
Njrat
DarkComet
Quasar RAT
asynrat
Nanocore RAT
Recently, Cyble found that cybercriminals are abusing ngrok.io to deliver phishing attacks.
The image below showcases one of the phishing links captured in Cyble’s Intelligence
repository.

Interestingly, we found multiple ngrok.io links used in darkweb markets/leaks and cybercrime
forums by different threat actors such as BIN CARDERS, Telegram- carder data, and
linlogpass. The leaks were captured by Cyble’s Threat Intelligence platform, as shown in the
below image.

Cyble research team also came across a post in a cybercrime forum about a phishing tool
kit, “KingFish3 (Social master). The image below showcases the threat actor’s post about the
phishing tool in the cybercrime forum. The threat actor also shared the Github link to the
phishing tool, which abuses ngrok.

The actor described the usage of tools as shown in the following image, thereby showcasing
more information about how the ngrok tunnel is being used to carry out successful phishing
attacks.

The post contains step-by-step instructions on how to use the publicly available GitHub code.
The image below shows the output of the phishing tools along with the applications targeted.

Based on further investigation and analysis of the phishing tool, we were able to identify
precisely how the cybercriminals abuse the ngrok tunnels to carry out phishing attacks
towards multiple organizations. Here are the steps based on our analysis.

4/6

1. The tool creates a tunnel using ngrok to the chosen phishing URL with the specified
port.
2. The hacker tracks real-time logs in the first session and waits for the victims to enter
their phone number.
3. The hacker then logs into the affected application’s official site with the harvested
credentials and generates an OTP (2FA).
4. Victims then enter the received OTP in the phishing site, which the hacker captures.
5. Finally, the hacker gains access to the victims’ official account using the OTP(2FA).

How to report these malicious URLs for takedowns: It’s quite straightforward, just drop a
note at contact@ngrok.com.
Our Recommendations:
Users of ngrok and other tunnelling services are advised to obtain authorization from
their information security teams.
It is advised to password-protect their tunnel access and enable IP whitelisting to
restrict access to only trusted IP addresses.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other
connected devices wherever possible and pragmatic.
Regularly monitor your financial transactions, and if you notice any suspicious activity,
contact your bank immediately.

5/6

Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected
devices, including PC, laptop, and mobile.
People concerned about their exposure to the Dark web can register
at AmiBreached.com to ascertain their exposure.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their
authenticity.
