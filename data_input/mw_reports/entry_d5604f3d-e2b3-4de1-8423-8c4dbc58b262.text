Looking Into the Void

Targeting Bulletproof Hosts to Block Attacks Early in the Kill Chain

Bulletproof hosting providers are a key enabler of cybercrime operations and APT groups
because they supply a stable infrastructure. Our investigation shows how the provider Void
Griffon has been integral to the activities of a number of high-profile gangs.
One of the basic requirements to keeping a cybercriminal operation running smoothly,
covertly, and for a prolonged period is a reliable web hosting service that can withstand
abuse complaints and law enforcement takedown requests. These bulletproof hosting
services are essentially cybercriminal hideouts for lease, designed specifically to give threat
actors stable servers where they can store malicious files or even the malware necessary for
their operations.

Void Griffon is our name for a provider that has been active since 2006. Its service has been
used for multiple years by some of today's top-tier advanced persistent threat (APT) groups
and malware distributors.
Trend Micro uses cybercriminals’ dependence on such infrastructure against them, tracking
and proactively blocking such service providers to protect customers early in the attack
chain. The short video series below tells you all you need to know about these bulletproof
hosting service providers.

Digging into Void Griffon
Our investigation into one specific bulletproof hosting provider, which we track as Void
Griffon, shows the exact services available, and how bulletproof hosting businesses support
long-running cybercriminal operations.
Void Griffon is a malicious actor group that we have been aware of since 2006. The group
has had different aliases over the years and has advertised a slew of services in
underground forums. It first offered its fast-flux bulletproof hosting service in 2015, and its
business has since flourished. We have found that Void Griffon has been used by different
APT groups and has also hosted many prominent malware families.

Dismantling support systems
Malicious actors and high-profile malware are usually widely reported on, but security teams
and law enforcement should also identify and disrupt the support systems that allow
cybercriminal activities to thrive. Analyzing these systems by proactively locating and
blocking the bulletproof hosting infrastructure will aid defenders in blocking attacks in the
early stages of the kill chain.
However, this is difficult for a network defender to do on their own. Trend Micro’s threat
intelligence allows us to do this on behalf of our customers and provide this protection
directly in our products.
We hope to bring more attention to the support pillars that allow cybercriminal campaigns to
operate, and what can be done to counteract them. Watch the short video series below for
more details about Void Griffon.
