Overview
Proofpoint researchers have uncovered a number of multistage attacks that use
cryptocurrency-related lures to infect victims with sophisticated backdoors and
reconnaissance malware that we attribute to the Lazarus Group. Victims of interest are then
infected with additional malware including Gh0st RAT to steal credentials for cryptocurrency
wallets and exchanges, enabling the Lazarus Group to conduct lucrative operations stealing
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We also discovered what appears to be the first publicly
documented instance of a nation-state targeting a point-of-sale related framework for the
theft of credit card data in a related set of attacks. Moreover, the timing of the point-of-sale
related attacks near the holiday shopping season makes the potential financial losses
considerable.
With activity dating at least to 2009, the Lazarus Group has consistently ranked among the
most disruptive, successful, and far-reaching nation-state sponsored actors. The March 20,
2013 attack in South Korea, the Sony Pictures hack in 2014, the successful theft of $81
million from the Bangladesh Bank in 2014, and perhaps most famously this year’s WannaCry
ransomware attack and its global impact have all been attributed to the group. The Lazarus
Group is widely accepted as being a North Korean state-sponsored threat actor by numerous
organizations in the information security industry, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence
agencies around the world.
The group has increasingly focused on financially motivated attacks and appears to be
capitalizing on both the increasing interest and skyrocketing prices for cryptocurrencies. The
Lazarus Group’s arsenal of tools, implants, and exploits is extensive and under constant

development. Previously, they have employed DDoS botnets, wiper malware to temporarily
incapacitate a company, and a sophisticated set of malware targeting the SWIFT banking
system to steal millions of dollars.
In this research we detail a new implant dubbed PowerRatankba, a PowerShell-based
malware variant that closely resembles the original Ratankba implant. We believe that
PowerRatankba was likely developed as a replacement in Lazarus Group’s strictly financially
motivated team’s arsenal to fill the hole left by Ratankba’s discovery and very public
documentation earlier this year.
We also provide a brief timeline of events related to the malicious activity and describe the
various delivery methods that Lazarus Group utilized to infect victims with PowerRatankba
(Fig. 1). We then detail the inner workings of PowerRatankba and how it is utilized to deliver
a more fully capable backdoor to interesting victims (Fig. 1). Following that, we share details
on a new and emerging threat targeting the point-of-sale industry that we have dubbed
RatankbaPOS (Fig. 1). Finally, we explain our high-confidence attribution to Lazarus Group.

While this report has introduced several new additions to Lazarus Group’s ever-growing
arsenal, including a variety of different attack vectors, a new PowerShell implant and Gh0st
RAT variant, as well as an emerging point-of-sale threat targeting South Korean devices,
there are two key takeaways from this research:

Analyzing a financially motivated arm of a state actor highlights an often overlooked or
underestimated aspect of state-sponsored attacks; in this case, we were able to
differentiate the actions of the financially motivated team within Lazarus from those of
their espionage and disruption teams that have recently grabbed headlines.
This group is now appears to be targeting individuals rather than just organizations:;
individuals are softer targets, often lacking resources and knowledge to defend
themselves and providing new avenues of monetization for a state-sponsored threat
actor’s toolkit.
Moreover, both the explosive growth in cryptocurrency values and the emergence of new
point-of-sale malware near the peak holiday shopping season provide an interesting example
of how one state-sponsored actor is following the money, adding direct theft from individuals
and organizations to the more “traditional” approach of targeting financial institutions for
espionage that we often observe with other APT actors.
