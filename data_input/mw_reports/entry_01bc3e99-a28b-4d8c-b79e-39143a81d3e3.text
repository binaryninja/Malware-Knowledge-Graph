Chinese Gas Pipeline Intrusion Campaign,
2011 to 2013
SUMMARY
Note: CISA released technical information,
including indicators of compromise (IOCs),
provided in this advisory in 2012 to affected
organizations and stakeholders.

This advisory uses the MITRE
ATT&CK® framework, version 9.
See the ATT&CK for Enterprise
framework for all referenced threat
actor tactics and techniques.

This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory—coauthored by the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)—
provides information on a spearphishing and intrusion campaign conducted by state-sponsored
Chinese actors that occurred from December 2011 to 2013, targeting U.S. oil and natural gas
(ONG) pipeline companies.
CISA and the FBI provided incident response and remediation support to a number of victims of
this activity. Overall the U.S. Government identified and tracked 23 U.S. natural gas pipeline
operators targeted from 2011 to 2013 in this spearphishing and intrusion campaign. Of the
known targeted entities, 13 were confirmed compromises, 3 were near misses, and 8 had an
unknown depth of intrusion.
The U.S. Government has attributed this activity to Chinese state-sponsored actors. CISA and
the FBI assess that these actors were specifically targeting U.S. pipeline infrastructure for the
purpose of holding U.S. pipeline infrastructure at risk. Additionally, CISA and the FBI assess that
this activity was ultimately intended to help China develop cyberattack capabilities against U.S.
pipelines to physically damage pipelines or disrupt pipeline operations.

To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local FBI field
office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at CyWatch@fbi.gov.

This advisory provides information on this campaign, including tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) and IOCs. The TTPs remain relevant to help network defenders protect
against intrusions. The IOCs in table 1 below are provided for historical awareness.
CISA and the FBI urge owners and operators of Energy Sector and other critical infrastructure
(CI) networks to adopt a heightened state of awareness and implement the recommendations
listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory, which include implementing network
segmentation between IT and industrial control system (ICS)/operational technology (OT)
networks. These mitigations will improve a CI entity’s defensive cyber posture and functional
resilience by reducing the risk of compromise or severe operational degradation if the system is
compromised by malicious cyber actors, including but not limited to actors associated with the
campaign described in this advisory.
For more information on Chinese malicious cyber activity, see us-cert.cisa.gov/china.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
In April 2012, CISA received reports about targeted attacks directed at multiple ONG pipeline
sites; CISA (via a predecessor organization) and FBI provided incident response and
remediation support to a number of victims from 2012 to 2013. CISA and FBI’s analysis of the
malware and threat actor techniques identified that this activity was related to a spearphishing
campaign. The U.S. Government identified and tracked 23 U.S. natural gas pipeline operators
targeted in this campaign. Of the 23 known targeted entities, 13 were confirmed compromises, 3
were near misses, and 8 had an unknown depth of intrusion.

Threat Actor Activity
The spearphishing activity appears to have started in late December 2011. From December 9,
2011, through at least February 29, 2012, ONG organizations received spearphishing emails
[T1566.002] specifically targeting their employees. The emails were at constructed with a high
level of sophistication to convince employees to view malicious files [T1204.002]. Note: see the
appendix for a table of the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques observed in this campaign.
In addition to spearphishing, CISA and the FBI were made aware of social engineering attempts
by malicious actors believed to be associated with this campaign. The apparent goal was to gain
sensitive information from asset owners [T1598]. One asset owner reported that individuals in
their network engineering department, including managers, received multiple phone calls
requesting information about their recent network security practices. Other employees in other
departments were not targeted. The asset owner also reported that these calls began
immediately after they had identified and removed the malicious intruder from their network and
performed a system-wide credential reset. The caller identified himself as an employee of a large
computer security firm performing a national survey about network cybersecurity practices. He
inquired about the organization’s policy and practices for firewall use and settings, types of
software used to protect their network, and the use and type of intrusion detection and/or

TLP:WHITE
prevention systems. The caller was blocking his caller ID and when the targeted organization
tried to return the call, they reached a number that was not in service.
During the investigation of these compromises, CISA and FBI personnel discovered that Chinese
state-sponsored actors specifically collected [TA0009] and exfiltrated [TA0010] ICS-related
information. The Chinese state-sponsored actors searched document repositories [T1213] for the
following data types:






Document searches: “SCAD*”
Personnel lists
Usernames/passwords
Dial-up access information
System manuals

Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also
compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to
transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks. Though designed for
legitimate business purposes, these systems have the potential to be manipulated by malicious
cyber actors if unmitigated. With this access, the Chinese state-sponsored actors could have
impersonated legitimate system operators to conduct unauthorized operations. According to the
evidence obtained by CISA and FBI, the Chinese state-sponsored actors made no attempts to
modify the pipeline operations of systems they accessed. Note: there was a significant number
of cases where log data was not available, and the depth of intrusion and persistent impacts
were unable to be determined; at least 8 of 23 cases (35 percent) identified in the campaign
were assessed as having an unknown depth of intrusion due to the lack of log data.
CISA and FBI assess that during these intrusions, China was successful in accessing the
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks at several U.S. natural gas pipeline
companies.
Chinese actors also gained information specific to dial-up access, including phone numbers,
usernames, and passwords [T1120]. Dial-up modems continue to be prevalent in the Energy
Sector, providing direct access into the ICS environment with little or no security and no
monitoring, which makes them an optimal vector for hold-at-risk operations. The exfiltrated data
provided the capabilities for the Chinese cyber actors to access ONG operational systems at a
level where they could potentially conduct unauthorized operations.

Exfiltrated Information and Assessed Motives
The Chinese actors specifically targeted information that pertained to access of ICSs. Searches
were made for terms involving “SCAD*,” and the actors exfiltrated documents, including
personnel lists, usernames and passwords, dial-up access information, remote terminal unit
(RTU) sites, and systems manuals. The Chinese actors also exfiltrated information pertaining to
ICS permission groups and compromised jump points between corporate and ICS networks. The
totality of this information would allow the actors to access ICS networks via multiple channels

TLP:WHITE

FBI | CISA

TLP:WHITE
and would provide sufficient access to allow them to remotely perform unauthorized operations
on the pipeline with physical consequences.
CISA and FBI assess that these intrusions were likely intended to gain strategic access to the
ICS networks for future operations rather than for intellectual property theft. This assessment
was based on the content of the data that was being exfiltrated and the TTPs used to gain that
access. One victim organization set up a honeypot that contained decoy documents with content
that appeared to be SCADA-related data and sensitive organizational information. According to
this organization, the SCADA-related decoy content was exfiltrated within 15 minutes of the time
it was made available in the honeypot. Other sensitive decoy information, including financial and
business-related information, was ignored.
CISA and FBI assess that this activity was ultimately intended to help China develop cyberattack
capabilities against U.S. pipelines to physically damage pipelines or disrupt pipeline operations.

MITIGATIONS
CISA and the FBI urge Energy Sector and other CI owners and operators to apply the following
mitigations to implement a layered, defense-in-depth cyber posture. By implementing a layered
approach, administrators will enhance the defensive cyber posture of their OT/ICS networks,
reducing the risk of compromise or severe operational degradation if their system is
compromised by malicious cyber actors.


Harden the IT/corporate network to reduce the risk of initial compromise.



Update all software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, in a
timely manner. Consider using a centralized patch management system.
Replace all end-of-life software and hardware devices.
Restrict and manage remote access software. Remote access tools are a common
method for threat actors to gain initial access and persistence on target networks.
 Manage and restrict users and groups who are permitted to access remote
capabilities. Permissions should be limited to users that require the capability to
complete their duties.
 Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access.
 Limit access to resources over networks, especially by restricting Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP). If RDP is operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources
and require MFA.
Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.
Implement unauthorized execution prevention by:
 Disabling macro scrips from Microsoft Office files transmitted via email. Consider
using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files transmitted via email
instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.
 Implementing application allowlisting, which only allows systems to execute
programs known and permitted by security policy. Implement software restriction
policies (SRPs) or other controls to prevent programs from executing from
common malware locations, such as temporary folders supporting popular internet
browsers.
Filter network traffic to prohibit ingress and egress communications with known
malicious IP addresses. Prevent users from accessing malicious websites by
implementing URL blocklists and/or allowlists.
Set antivirus/antimalware programs to regularly scan IT network assets using upto-date signatures.

Implement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and ICS networks
to limit the ability of cyber threat actors to move laterally to ICS networks if the IT network
is compromised.
o Implement a network topology for ICS that has multiple layers, with the most
critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer. For more
information refer to National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Special
Publication 800-82: Guide to ICS Security.
o Use one-way communication diodes to prevent external access, whenever
possible.
o Set up demilitarized zones (DMZs) to create a physical and logical subnetwork that
acts as an intermediary for connected security devices to avoid exposure.
o Employ reliable network security protocols and services where feasible.

TLP:WHITE

FBI | CISA

TLP:WHITE
o

Consider using virtual local area networks (VLANs) for additional network
segmentation, for example, by placing all printers in separate, dedicated VLANs and
restricting users’ direct printer access.



Implement perimeter security between network segments to limit the ability of cyber
threat actors to move laterally.
o Control traffic between network segments by using firewalls, intrusion detection
systems (IDSs), and filter routers and switches.
o Implement network monitoring at key chokepoints—including egress points to the
internet, between network segments, core switch locations—and at key assets or
services (e.g., remote access services).
o Configure an IDS to create alarms for any ICS traffic outside normal operations (after
establishing a baseline of normal operations and network traffic).
o Configure security incident and event monitoring (SIEM) to monitor, analyze, and
correlate event logs from across the ICS network to identify intrusion attempts.



Implement the following additional ICS environment best practices:
o Update all software. Use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which ICS
network and assets and zones should participate in the patch management program.
 Test all patches in off-line text environments before implementation.
o Implement application allowlisting on human machine interfaces.
o Harden field devices, including tablets and smartphones.
o Replace all end-of-life software and hardware devices.
o Disable unused ports and services on ICS devices (after testing to ensure this will
not affect ICS operation).
o Restrict and manage remote access software. Require MFA for remote access to
ICS networks.
o Configure encryption and security for ICS protocols.
o Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets
are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.
o Do not allow vendors to connect their devices to the ICS network. Use of a
compromised device could introduce malware.
o Maintain an ICS asset inventory of all hardware, software, and supporting
infrastructure technologies.
o Ensure robust physical security is in place to prevent unauthorized personal from
accessing controlled spaces that house ICS equipment.
o Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if
ICS/OT networks need to be taken offline.
o Manage the supply chain by adjusting the ICS procurement process to weigh
cybersecurity heavily as part of the scoring and evaluation methodology. Additionally,
establish contractual agreements for all outsourced services that ensure proper
incident handling and reporting, security of interconnections, and remote access
specifications and processes.



Implement the following additional best practices:
o Implement IP geo-blocking, as appropriate.
o Implement regular, frequent data backup procedures on both the IT and ICS
networks. Data backup procedures should address the following best practices:
 Ensure backups are regularly tested.
 Store backups separately, i.e., backups should be isolated from network
connections that could enable spread of malware or lateral movement.
 Maintain regularly updated “gold images” of critical systems in the event they need
to be rebuilt.
 Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems in the even rebuilding the primary
system is not preferred.
o Implement a user training program to train employees to recognize spearphishing
attempts, discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious
attachments, and re-enforce appropriate user response to spearphishing emails.
