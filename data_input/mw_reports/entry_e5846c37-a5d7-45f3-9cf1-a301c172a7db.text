Morphisec Labs has observed a new wave of JSSLoader infections this year. We’ve tracked
JSSLoader activity since December 2020 and published a thorough report on the Russian
criminal hacking group FIN7’s JSSLoader: The Evolution of the FIN7 JSSLoader. JSSLoader

is a small, very capable .NET remote access trojan (RAT). Its capabilities include data
exfiltration, persistence, auto-updating, additional payload delivery, and more.
Attackers are now using .XLL files to deliver a new, obfuscated version of JSSLoader. We
explain how this new malware variant utilizes the Excel add-ins feature to load the malware
and inspect the changes inside.

Infection Chain

Figure 1: From .xll file to JSSLoader
This infection chain is similar to other XLL infections. The victim receives a malicious
attachment, either an XLM or XLL file, inside an email. Once the attachment is downloaded
and executed, Excel loads and executes the malicious code inside the .xll file, which then
downloads the payload from a remote server. The payload is a new, similar variant of
JSSLoader.

XLL Excel Add-in
The first stage of the malware responsible for downloading JSSLoader into an infected
machine uses an Excel add-in file, denoted by an XLL file extension. Because the file isn’t
signed, a popup displays for the user before executing:

Each XLL file must implement and export the xlAutoOpen function. This function is called by
Excel whenever an XLL is activated. In our case, the malicious activity is located at the end
of xlAutoOpen:

Before exiting from the function, the malware loads itself, the .XLL file, into memory (not
relevant to the attack) and calls the mw_download_and_execute function.
This function is responsible for downloading the payload from a remote server. An attacker
uses a different User-Agent between samples to help avoid network signature-based security
solutions.

Once downloaded, the XLL file creates a temp file with a DNA prefix using a
GetTempFileNameW API call and executes it as a new process.

New Obfuscation Layer
Look carefully at the dropped sample and compare it with a JSSLoader sample. They share
the exact same execution flow. So, what's different? This variant introduces a new layer of
string obfuscation, renaming all functions and variables names.

In order to evade static threat scanners, this variant has a simple string decoding
mechanism:

Figure 7: New variant’s string obfuscation
This version appears focused on breaking the string-based YARA rules used in the wild. It
does so by splitting the strings into substrings and concatenating them at runtime.

This New Malware Variant Evades Traditional Security
Morphisec Labs will continue to monitor the evolution of JSSLoader and its delivery methods.
Although it didn't present new capabilities, this new JSSLoader variant is a worry. Especially
for organizations relying on their next-generation antivirus (NGAV) or endpoint detection and
response (EDR) to stop it. Most NGAV and EDR solutions won’t detect day zero .XLL files
hiding a JSSLoader. It can take days or weeks before signatures are deployed, all while
attackers have free reign inside your network.
However, Morphisec’s Moving Target Defense (MTD) technology instantly stops these and
other unknown and zero-day attacks. It uses system polymorphism to unpredictably hide
application targets, operating system targets, and other critical asset targets from
adversaries. This leads to a dramatically reduced attack surface.
Gartner analysts have called Moving Target Defense a “game changer.” MTD can uniquely
detect and stop ransomware, zero-day, and other advanced attacks that bypass NGAV, EDR,
and other defenses. Learn more about Moving Target Defense and why Gartner cited this
technology in its report: Emerging Trends and Technologies Impact Radar for Security.
