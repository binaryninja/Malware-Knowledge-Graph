(Note: Read our latest comprehensive report on ransomware: Ransomware 1H 2017
review: Global outbreaks reinforce the value of security hygiene.)
We at the MMPC are constantly tracking new and emerging ransomware threats so we can
be one step ahead of active campaigns and help protect our users. As part of these efforts,
we recently came across a new variant of the Win32/Troldesh ransomware family.
Ransomware, like most malware, is constantly trying to change itself in an attempt to evade
detection. In this case, we’ve seen the following updates to Troldesh:
Tor functionality
Glyph/symbol errors on the wallpaper ransom note
Modified extension names for encrypted files
New malware being delivered (Trojan:Win32/Mexar.A)
Updates the ransom note to cover the Tor functionality
The biggest change in this update is the addition of Tor links. Using Tor addresses as the
ransom payment method (as opposed to standard www addresses) is the current fashion
among ransomware.
The ransom note now includes links to the Tor address (previously, the only method provided
for obtaining decryption was an email address):

However, upon investigation it appears that Tor has blocked the address:

Errors have been introduced into the image that replaces the user’s desktop wallpaper (this
occurred to several samples, but not all):

After encryption, Troldesh changes the file’s extension. In the latest update, we’ve seen it
use the following strings:
.da_vinci_code
.magic_software_syndicate
For example, an encrypted file might appear as follows:

The list of file types that Troldesh encrypts has also increased – see the Win32/Troldesh
description for a full list.

Prevention
To help stay protected:
Keep your Windows Operating System and antivirus up-to-date and, if you haven’t
already, upgrade to Windows 10.
4/5

Regularly back-up your files in an external hard-drive
Enable file history or system protection. On Windows 10 and Windows 8.1, set up a
drive for file history
Use OneDrive for Business
Beware of phishing emails, spams, and clicking malicious attachment
Use Microsoft Edge to get SmartScreen protection. It can help warn you about sites
that are known to be hosting exploits, and help protect you from socially-engineered
attacks such as phishing and malware downloads.
Disable the loading of macros in your Office programs
Disable your Remote Desktop feature whenever possible
Use two factor authentication
Use a safe Internet connection
Avoid browsing web sites that are known for being malware breeding grounds (such as
illegal music, movies and TV, and software download sites)

Detection
Ensure your antimalware protection (such as Windows Defender) is up-to-date and
working correctly.
Enable Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) to get the latest cloud-based
ransomware detection and blocking.

Recovery
In the Office 365 “How to deal with ransomware” blog, there are several options on how you
might be able to remediate or recover from a ransomware attack, including backup and
recovery using File History in Windows 10 and System Restore in Windows 7.
You can also use OneDrive and SharePoint to backup and restore your files:
OneDrive for Business and SharePoint:
Restore a previous version of a document in OneDrive for Business
Restore Option in SharePoint Online
OneDrive for home users:
Find lost or missing files in OneDrive
Delete or restore files and folders
