Russian national Sergey Medvedev, one of the co-founders of Internet-based cybercriminal
enterprise Infraud Organization and an admin on the organization's carding portal, today
pleaded guilty to RICO conspiracy.
In February 2018, US authorities indicted 36 individuals for alleged roles in the transnational
Infraud cybercrime group, out of 10,901 registered members in March 2017, and
apprehended 13 defendants from the United States and six countries: Australia, the United
Kingdom, France, Italy, Kosovo and Serbia.
"During the course of its seven-year history, the Infraud Organization inflicted approximately
$2.2 billion in intended losses, and more than $568 million in actual losses, on a wide swath
of financial institutions, merchants, and private individuals, and would have continued to do
so for the foreseeable future if left unchecked," a DoJ release says.

Infraud facilitated the large-scale acquisition, sale, and distribution of stolen identity
information and payment cards, personally identifiable data, financial and banking info,
computer malware, and various other contraband.

The Infraud organization also "directed traffic and potential purchasers to the automated
vending sites of its members, which served as online conduits to traffic in stolen means of
identification, stolen financial and banking information, malware, and other illicit goods."
The operation and its website were active between October 2010 when it was created by
Svyatoslav Bondarenko (at infraud[.]cc and infraud[.]ws, later moved to other locations) and
until February 2018 when Infraud and its site were taken down following a joint operation
between law enforcement agencies from seven countries.

All members needed admin approval to join
Infraud's forum hierarchy included administrators (4DMini57r470rz), super-moderators
(Super MODER470R5), and moderators (M0d3r470r2) who oversaw the activity of users
known as vendors (Doctors or Professors), VIP members (Fratello Masons or Advanced
Members), and regular members (Phr4Ud573r).
To join Infraud's online forum, all users needed approval from one of the Infraud
administrators and they also faced removal if the products they sold on the forum were
considered subpar by the admins.
Medvedev, as one of Infraud's co-founder, operated an 'escrow' / currency exchanging
service that ensured the transaction integrity between organization members. Medvedev
took the role of owner and admin of the Infraud Organization after Bondarenko went
missing in 2015.

second superseding criminal indictment filed on February 7, 2018.

Today, another Russian national, Aleksey Yurievich Burkov, was sentenced to 9 years in
prison for operating Cardplanet and Direct Connection, two sites that facilitated payment
card fraud, computer hacking, and other cybercrimes according to another release
published today by DoJ officials.
The Cardplanet site was a card shop (also known as a CVV shop and carding site) where
Burkov oversaw the selling of payment card (debit and credit card) numbers stolen from
hundreds of thousands of individuals, many of them U.S. Citizens, between at least early
2009 through at least August 2013.
The carding shop was also used to sell data from over 150,000 stolen payment cards which
resulted in estimated fraud losses and fraudulent purchases of over $20,000,000.
