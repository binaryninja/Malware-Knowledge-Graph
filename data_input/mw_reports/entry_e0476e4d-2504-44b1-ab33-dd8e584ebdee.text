Executive Summary
Trickbot remains one of the most sophisticated banking trojans in the landscape while
constantly evolving.
Highly modular, Trickbot can adapt to different environments with the help of its various
modules.
The group behind Trickbot has expanded their activities beyond credential theft into
leasing malware to APT groups.

Overview
In recent years, the modular banking trojan known as Trickbot has evolved to become one of
the most advanced trojans in the threat landscape. It has gone through a diverse set of
changes since it was first discovered in 2016, including adding features that focus on
Windows 10 and modules that target point of sale (POS) systems. Not only does it function
as a standalone trojan, Trickbot is also commonly used as a dropper for other malware such
as the Ryuk ransomware. The wide range of functionality allows this malware to adapt to
different environments and maximize effectiveness in a compromised network.

Trickbot is typically delivered via a spam email containing a malicious document or malicious
URL. In most cases, the subject of the emails will contain wording that is intended to alarm
the person who received it, such as an issue with a credit or debit card, and in recent
examples preying on fears of the COVID-19 virus. Once this document has been opened, a
macro will execute and download the next stage of the infection process. In some cases, the
second stage of this infection chain is a loader like Emotet which in turn drops Trickbot. In a
reverse of roles, Trickbot has also been commonly observed to drop other malware families.

Functionality
A successor to the Dyre trojan, Trickbot was originally designed to steal and exfiltrate
sensitive information from a compromised host through stealing cookies from browsers or
performing webinjects on banking or cryptocurrency trading sites. Over the years, Trickbot
has not only expanded that functionality, but also added new features such as the ability to
be used as a dropper for other malware. Trickbot is highly modular and can be configured by
the threat actor depending on the environment being targeted. Trickbot has a wide range of
capabilities enabled by the different modules that can be installed remotely. Here's a
rundown of a few of the modules:

A recent addition to the Trickbot arsenal of modules is "rdpScanDll" which allows the
malware to brute-force Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials. The list of available
modules for Trickbot is growing larger with time which shows that the authors are actively
looking for new ways to use it for financial gain. The creators have shown repeatedly that
they are persistent in regards to improving the functionality of Trickbot and its modules, and
should be considered as a significant threat.
Trickbot employs several different techniques for obfuscation and evasion. TLS is used for
command and control (C2) communications and while downloading the various modules for
installation. C2 typically happens on the standard TLS port 443 but has also been observed
to use port 449 on occasion. TLS is not the only form of encryption used by Trickbot. While
exfiltrating sensitive information from a compromised host, the Microsoft CryptoAPI is used
to encrypt the data as an extra layer of obfuscation.

There are several different obfuscation and evasion techniques that Trickbot has used
throughout its lifetime including process hollowing, Heaven's Gate, custom base64 encoding
and bypassing UAC. Trickbot has added functionality that is tailored specifically to Windows
10 after Microsoft dropped extended support for Windows 7 in early 2020. Earlier this year, a
new feature was added which allowed fileless UAC bypass through the use of
"WSReset.exe," a Microsoft signed binary used to reset Windows Store settings.

Trickbot Gang
The actors behind Trickbot are commonly referred to as the "Trickbot Gang." Financial gain
is the primary motive for this group's actions. The group's operations have grown along with
the malware itself. At the time of this writing, the group has ventured into pushing a malicious
Android application to victims whose Windows machines have been infected with Trickbot.
The intent is to convince the user to install the application on their Android phone, which
steals one-time codes that banks send as part of a 2FA sequence. Currently, this attack has
only been observed in Germany, but it is likely the use of this technique will increase if it
proves to be effective.
Trickbot Gang also rents a Trickbot variant to state-sponsored APT groups. Not only are they
supplying the malware, but they are also selling the access they have gained to high profile
networks across the globe. This cooperation reflects the trend in recent years of statesponsored cyber espionage groups interacting with cyber criminal organizations.
One of the most devastating threats that Trickbot poses is the delivery of the Ryuk
ransomware with the help of Emotet. This has proven to be a dangerously effective
combination, generating millions of dollars of income in 2019 alone. The reason for this
combination of malware is that the Trickbot modules for lateral movement are an efficient
means to propagate across a network before deploying Ryuk.

How to defend against Trickbot
To defend against Trickbot it is important to ensure a well organized, multi-layered
cybersecurity program is in place within your organization.
1. Email and spam filters are critical in the case of Trickbot as this is the initial infection
vector.
2. Perform regular updates and system hardening as Trickbot uses known Windows SMB
exploits for propagation.
3. Give employees regular phishing training and conduct regular awareness programs.
4. Employ strong password policies and use multi-factor authentication, such as Duo.
5. Ensure updated endpoint security software, such as Cisco's AMP Endpoint, is
deployed across your network.

Practical security hygiene is critical in any given scenario but in the case of defending
against Trickbot â€” it is even more important to maintain a strong security posture. Due to the
modular nature of Trickbot, it is impossible to predict how it will behave once it has an initial
foothold, hence the importance of preventative security measures.
