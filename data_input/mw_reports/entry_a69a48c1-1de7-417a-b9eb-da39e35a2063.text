Top CVEs Actively Exploited By People’s Republic
of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors
Summary
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides the top Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVEs) used since 2020 by People’s Republic of China (PRC) statesponsored cyber actors as assessed by the National Security Agency (NSA),
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known
vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks as well as software and
hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive
networks.
This joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and
state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the
Defense Industrial Base Sector; and private sector organizations about notable trends
and persistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
NSA, CISA, and FBI urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and
private sector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations
section and Appendix A to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of
compromise from PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber actors.
For more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s
China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage, FBI’s Industry Alerts, and
NSA’s Cybersecurity Advisories & Guidance.

TLP:WHITE

Technical details
NSA, CISA, and FBI continue to assess PRC state-sponsored cyber activities as being
one of the largest and most dynamic threats to U.S. government and civilian networks.
PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to target government and critical
infrastructure networks with an increasing array of new and adaptive techniques—some
of which pose a significant risk to Information Technology Sector organizations
(including telecommunications providers), Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector
organizations, and other critical infrastructure organizations.
PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities and use
publicly available tools to target networks of interest. NSA, CISA, and FBI assess PRC
state-sponsored cyber actors have actively targeted U.S. and allied networks as well as
software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into
sensitive networks. See Table 1 for the top used CVEs.

Path Traversal

These state-sponsored actors continue to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to
obfuscate their activities and target web-facing applications to establish initial access.
Many of the CVEs indicated in Table 1 allow the actors to surreptitiously gain
unauthorized access into sensitive networks, after which they seek to establish
persistence and move laterally to other internally connected networks. For additional
information on PRC state-sponsored cyber actors targeting network devices, please see

and Devices.

Mitigations
NSA, CISA, and FBI urge organizations to apply the recommendations below and those
listed in Appendix A.








Update and patch systems as soon as possible. Prioritize patching vulnerabilities
identified in this CSA and other known exploited vulnerabilities.
Utilize phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication whenever possible. Require
all accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords, and change
passwords immediately if there are indications that a password may have been
compromised.
Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge.
Upgrade or replace end-of-life devices.
Move toward the Zero Trust security model.
Enable robust logging of Internet-facing systems and monitor the logs for
anomalous activity.

Appendix A
Table II: Apache CVE-2021-44228

Apache CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 3.0: 10 (Critical)
Vulnerability Description
Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI
features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against malicious actor
controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. A malicious actor who can control log messages or
log message parameters could execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message
lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From
version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.
Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other
Apache Logging Services projects.
Recommended Mitigations
 Apply patches provided by vendor and perform required system updates.
Detection Methods
 See vendor’s Guidance For Preventing, Detecting, and Hunting for Exploitation of the Log4j 2
Vulnerability.

CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical)

Vulnerability Description
Microsoft has released security updates for Windows Exchange Server. To exploit these vulnerabilities,
an authenticated malicious actor could send malicious requests to an affected server. A malicious actor
who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities would execute arbitrary code and compromise the
affected systems. If successfully exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an adversary to obtain
access to sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, cause a denial of service conditions,
and/or perform unauthorized actions on the affected Exchange server, which could aid in further
malicious activity.
Recommended Mitigations
 Apply the appropriate Microsoft Security Update.
 Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 23 (KB5000871)
 Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Cumulative Update 18 (KB5000871)

Table XVI: Apache CVE-2022-24112

Apache CVE-2022-24112 CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical)
Vulnerability Description
A malicious actor can abuse the batch-requests plugin to send requests to bypass the IP restriction of
Admin API. A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote
code execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port
different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of
Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client
IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed.
Recommended Mitigations
 In affected versions of Apache APISIX, you can avoid this risk by explicitly commenting out
batch-requests in the conf/config.yaml and conf/config-default.yaml files and restarting Apache
APISIX.
 Update to 2.10.4 or 2.12.1.

Table XXI: Apache CVE-2021-41773

Apache CVE-2021-41773 CVSS 3.0: 7.5 (High)
Vulnerability Description
This vulnerability has been modified since it was last analyzed by NVD. It is awaiting reanalysis,
which may result in further changes to the information provided. A flaw was found in a change
made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. A malicious actor could use a path
traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files
outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied,"
these requests can succeed. Enabling CGI scripts for these aliased paths could allow for remote code
execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and
not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 is incomplete (see CVE-2021-42013).
Recommended Mitigations
 Apply update or patch.
Detection Methods
 Commercially available scanners can detect CVE.
