In November 2016, we observed the reemergence of destructive attacks associated with the
2012 Shamoon attack campaign. We covered this attack in detail in our blog titled Shamoon
2: Return of the Disttrack Wiper, which targeted a single organization in Saudi Arabia and was
set to wipe systems on November 17, 2016. Since our previous publication, we have found
another, similar but diﬀerent payload used to target a second organization in Saudi Arabia that
was conﬁgured to wipe systems twelve days later on November 29, 2016. This latest attack
potentially materially impacts one of the primary countermeasures employed against wiper
attacks: Virtual Desktop Interface snapshots.
The payload used in this attack was very similar to the November 17, 2016 payload, but
exhibited slightly diﬀerent behaviors and contained hardcoded account credentials speciﬁc to
the newly targeted organization. The hardcoded account credentials met Windows password
complexity requirements, which suggests that the threat actors obtained the credentials
through a previous, separate attack, similar to the November 17, 2016 attack.
The most notable thing about this latest sample is that it contains several usernames and
passwords from oﬃcial Huawei documentation related to their virtual desktop infrastructure
(VDI) solutions, such as FusionCloud. VDI solutions can provide some protection against a
destructive malware like Disttrack through the ability to load snapshots of wiped systems. The
fact that the Shamoon attackers had these usernames and passwords may suggest that they
intended on gaining access to these technologies at the targeted organization to increase the
impact of their destructive attack. If true, this is a major development and organizations
should consider adding additional safeguards in protecting the credentials related to their VDI
deployment.
At this time, we have no details of the attack we believe preceded this Shamoon attack to
obtain credentials. We also have no details on the delivery method used to deliver the new,
similar, but diﬀerent Disttrack payload in this attack.

The Second Shamoon 2 Attack

This second known attack associated with Shamoon 2 also used the Disttrack payload, albeit
a new, similar but diﬀerent one from the original Shamoon 2 attack. Speciﬁcally, it used a 64bit variant that was conﬁgured to begin its destructive activities on November 29, 2016. Like
the Disttrack sample used in the ﬁrst reported Shamoon 2 attack, it including a wiper and
communications module stored in resources within the executable.
Table 1 below shows that the method the Disttrack payload uses to extract and decrypt the
modules from resources is the same; however, the resource names changed from “X509”,
“PKCS7” and “PKCS12” to “LANG”, “MENU” and “ICO”.

Our eﬀorts to decrypt the “ICO” resource have thus far been unsuccessful as the Disttrack
payload has an associated key but does not contain code that decrypts and extracts this
resource.

Propagation Inside Compromised Networks
Similar to the previous attack, the Disttrack payload in this attack spreads to other systems
on the local network (/24 network speciﬁcally) by logging in using legitimate domain account
credentials, copying itself to the system and creating a scheduled task that executes the
copied payload. While this method is the same as discussed in our previous blog, the
account credentials used in this attack were speciﬁc to the targeted organization and the ﬁle
names used when copying the payload to remote systems were diﬀerent.

Legitimate User Accounts
There were 16 account credentials found hardcoded within the Disttrack payload, appearing
to be a mixture of individual user accounts and broader administrator accounts. All but one of
the passwords met Windows complexity requirements, speciﬁcally, containing uppercase and
lowercase characters, and either a number, symbol, or both. One of the general administrator
accounts seen in this payload was also in the Disttrack payload in the ﬁrst Shamoon 2 attack
from November 17, 2016, which may not be speciﬁc to the targeted organization and instead
used as an attempt to guess the login credentials. Based upon the existence of these
credentials, it is highly likely the threat actors had carried out a previous attack to obtain
these account credentials, as it is unlikely that these passwords were guessed or brute
forced.
As noted earlier, a new development with this latest Disttrack payload is that several of the
usernames and passwords are found within oﬃcial documentation as administrator accounts
for Huawei’s virtualized desktop infrastructure (VDI) products, such as FusionCloud. This may
suggest that the targeted organization used these credentials when deploying Huawei VDI

systems. Shamoon actors may have obtained these credentials from a prior attack; however,
it is also possible that the actors included these default usernames and passwords as an
attempt to guess the login credentials to the VDI infrastructure.
VDI solutions can provide some protection against a destructive malware like Disttrack
through the ability to load snapshots of wiped systems. Also, since FusionCloud systems run
a Linux operating system, which would not be susceptible to wiping by the Windows-only
Disttrack malware, this could be seen as a reasonable countermeasure against attacks like
Shamoon. However, if the attacker was able to log into the VDI management interfaces using
the account credentials they could manually carry out destructive activities against the VDI
deployment, as well as any snapshots. The targeting of VDI solutions with legitimate, stolen or
default credential represents an escalation in tactics that administrators should be aware of
and take immediate steps to evaluate and address.

New Disttrack Names
The ﬁlenames that the payload copies itself to within the System32 folder of the remote
system diﬀers from the previously reported attack, speciﬁcally using “ntertmgr32.exe” for 32bit or “ntertmgr64.exe” for 64-bit systems. The scheduled task executes these ﬁles on the
remote system, which results in the creation of a Disttrack service named “NtertSrv”
compared to the service name “ntssrv” created by the Disttrack payload used in the
November 17, 2016 attacks. This can be seen in Figure 1.

Command and Control
The communications module used in this attack is rather hobbled, as it was conﬁgured
without an operational command and control (C2) server to communicate with. The lack of an
operational C2 is much like the November 17, 2016 attack that had the IP address “1.1.1.1”
within its conﬁguration to use as a C2 server. Unlike the non-operational C2 of “1.1.1.1” used
in the ﬁrst Shamoon 2 attack, this communications module completely lacked any IP address
or domain name for a C2 server within its conﬁguration.
Also, in this sample, Disttrack did not save its communications module to the system using
the ﬁlename “netinit.exe” like in the original attack, rather it chose a random name from the
following list:
• caiaw00e.exe
• sbuvideo.exe
• caiaw00i.exe
• olvume.exe
• usinwb2.exe
• briaw005.exe
• fpwwlwf.exe
• epiaw003.exe
• briaw002.exe
• olvsnap.exe
• dmwaudio.exe
• briaw006.exe
• miWApRpl.exe
• caiaw00b.exe
• lxiaw003.exe
Lastly, the communications module also uses diﬀerent ﬁle names than the original Shamoon 2
attack. Instead of setting a custom “kill time” in a ﬁle named “usbvideo324.pnf” within the
“%WINDOWS%\inf” folder, it uses a ﬁle name of “dcT21x400i.pnf”. It also would send the C2
server the contents of a ﬁle named “vsfnp7_6.pnf” from the folder “%WINDOWS%\inf”
instead of “netimm173.pnf”.

Destruction
Much like the initial attacks, the lack of an operational C2 server suggests that the threat
actor’s sole intention for carrying out this Shamoon 2 attack was to destroy data and
systems. Without an operational C2, the actor would be unable to issue a command to set a
custom “kill time” when the Disttrack payload would begin wiping systems, which would force
the payload to rely on its hardcoded “kill time”. The hardcoded date suggests that this attack
was set to begin wiping systems on November 29, 2016 at 1:30 AM local Saudi Arabia time.
Unlike the previous Shamoon attacks that occurred on a holiday and over a weekend, this kill
time occurred during the work week, as November 29, 2016 was a Tuesday. However, it
appears this attack attempted to maximize its impact by occurring very early in the morning
before the majority of the organization’s staﬀ were on site. This aligns with the Shamoon
actors conducting their attacks oﬀ-hours to increase the eﬃcacy of the attack by increasing
the timeframe of detection and response.

When Disttrack observes the system clock exceeding the “kill time”, it will save its wiper
component to the system using one of the following randomly chosen ﬁlenames:
• pdwmtphw.exe
• caiaw00a.exe
• sdwprint.exe
• caiaw00d.exe
• kyiaw002.exe
• sdwscdrv.exe
• briaw00a.exe
• saiaw002.exe
• _mvscdsc.exe
• hdvmp32.exe
• _s3wcap32.exe
• hpiaw001.exe
• lxiaw004.exe
• cniaw001.exe
• lxiaw006.exe
• caiaw00f.exe
• newtvsc.exe
When executed, the wiper component will extract a kernel driver from its resource section and
decrypt it with a 172-byte XOR key. The wiper saves the kernel driver (SHA256:
5a826b4fa10891cf63aae832fc645ce680a483b915c608ca26cedbb173b1b80a) to the
“Windows\System32\Drivers” folder in a ﬁle named “vdsk911.sys”. The wiper then uses this
ﬁle to create a kernel driver service named “vdsk911”, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2 RawDisk kernel driver service created by Disttrack wiper
The kernel driver is the 64-bit version of the commercial RawDisk driver by EldoS
Corporation, which is the exact same ﬁle as the “drdisk.sys” driver extracted from the
Disttrack 64-bit payload in the ‘X509’ resource in the ﬁrst reported Shamoon 2 attack. The
Disttrack payload will use this kernel driver to access the master boot record (MBR), partition
tables and ﬁles and folders on the system to overwrite them with the same image of the
deceased Syrian boy as in the previous Shamoon 2 attack.
During our analysis, we again observed the wiper setting the system time to a random date
between August 1 and August 20, 2012, as seen in Figure 3. As mentioned in our previous
blog, the reason the wiper sets the system time to this random date in August 2012 is due to
a temporary license key needed to use the RawDisk kernel driver. The temporary license key
used in this attack is the exact same as the ﬁrst attack.

Figure 3 Wiper changing the system date to a random date in August 2012
Since our original blog, we’ve successfully decrypted the license key, which can be seen in
Figure 4. The expiration date in the temporary license key is an 8-byte ﬁeld (highlighted by the
orange box) that corresponds to Microsoft’s FILETIME structure, which represents the
number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 (UTC). In the temporary license
key used in all of the Shamoon related attacks, the expiration date was set to August 30,
2012 at 8:34:29 UTC, which is the reason the wiper sets the system time to a random day
between August 1 and August 20, 2012. Also, we found that the temporary license key was
registered to “binnatova@bsunanotechnology.com”. We are unsure how this email address is
involved with Shamoon, as it was likely compromised back in 2012 and used by the actor to
obtain the temporary license for RawDisk.

After the MBR, partition tables and ﬁles are overwritten, the wiper issues the command of
“shutdown -r -f -t 2” to reboot the system, which is the same command as used in the ﬁrst
Shamoon 2 attack. Figure 5 shows the dialog box that pops up as a result of this command,
which will be followed by a system reboot.

by Disttrack
The purpose of rebooting the system remains the same, as the portions of the hard disk and
ﬁlesystem needed to successfully boot the system were overwritten with a JPEG image, the
system is no longer able to start up. Figure 6 shows the result of this reboot in an analysis
virtual machine, as the operating system could no longer be found.

The operating system fails to load as the MBR is overwritten with a JPEG image. As seen in
Figure 7, sector 0 of the physical hard disk, which normally stores the master boot record now
contains the beginning of a JPEG ﬁle marked by the “JFIF” magic bytes in the two orange
boxes.

Conclusion
We analyzed a second Disttrack payload associated with Shamoon 2, which suggests that the
threat actors targeted a second Saudi Arabian organization in this attack campaign. The
actors used the Disttrack payload to spread to other systems on the local network using
legitimate credentials. The legitimate credentials were speciﬁc to the targeted organization
and were complex enough to suggest that the threat actors carried out a previous attack to
obtain the credentials. Also, the actors hardcoded credentials found in Huawei’s oﬃcial
documentation for its VDI solutions, suggesting that the threat actors may have had access to
appliances hosting the infrastructure. The Disttrack wiper was set to begin overwriting
systems on November 29, 2016 at 1:30 AM, which aligns with the Shamoon actor’s tactic to
maximize its impact by attacking at a time when the targeted organization would have less
staﬀ and resources available onsite.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from the Disttrack payload used in this attack:
WildFire properly classiﬁes Disttrack samples as malicious
Threat protection AV signature of Virus/Win32.WGeneric.ktoto detects the new payload.
AutoFocus customers can monitor Disttrack activity using the Disttrack tag
