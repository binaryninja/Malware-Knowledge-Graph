Howdy, and welcome to the ThreatConnect Research Roundup, a collection of recent
findings by our Research Team and items from open source publications that have resulted
in Observations of related indicators across ThreatConnect’s CAL™ (Collective Analytics
1/4

Layer).

Roundup Highlight: Suspected Naikon DGA Domains

Naikon related intelligence in ThreatConnect Common Community
Our highlight in this week’s Roundup is Incident 20200519B: Suspected Naikon DGAs. After
reviewing research published by Check Point and Kaspersky, our team identified additional
suspected Naikon DGA domains consistent with registration and hosting data of previously
identified Naikon domains:

2/4

dwjmannje[.]com (shared IP with previously identified forcejoyt[.]com)
ujghr63revf[.]org (shared IP with previously identified rrgwmmwgk[.]com)
76rythb5435[.]org (shared IP with previously identified rrgwmmwgk[.]com)
46vev33g81[.]org (shared registration data with ujghr63revf[.]org and
76rythb5435[.]org)
Additional domains identified based on registration and hosting consistencies:
etnwtmrkh[.]com
nrtfmwhim[.]com
wahatmrjn[.]com
We don’t have any information on the extent to which, if any, these domains have been used
maliciously. However, given the commonalities identified, these domains merit scrutiny as
possible Naikon DGA domains.

20200526B: Possible APT34 Domain lebworld[.]us ThreatConnect Research identified
the possible APT34 / Helix Kitten / OilRig domain lebworld[.]us, which has registration
and hosting consistencies with previously identified APT34 infrastructure. This domain
was registered through MonoVM on May 18 2020 using jame@protonmail[.]com, and is
hosted on a probable dedicated server at 23.19.227[.]117. We don’t have any
information on the extent to which, if any, this infrastructure has been used maliciously.
It’s important to note that the identified registration and hosting consistencies are not
enough to definitively attribute this infrastructure to APT34.
20200526A: Server Support Domains Registered Through ITitch ThreatConnect
Research identified two domains — login-server[.]support and domain-server[.]support
— that were registered through ITitch within about a minute of each other on May 22
2020 and most likely were registered by the same actor. Start of authority (SOA)
records show the login-server[.]support domain was registered using trabant@cock[.]li.
This domain is currently hosted on a probable dedicated server at 102.152[.]107 and,
per urlscan.io, redirects to CNBC’s legitimate website.
SOA records show domain-server[.]support was registered using jirajira@cock[.]li. This
domain is hosted on a probable dedicated server at 185.10.68[.]163, has switched to using
its own name server, and hosts a mail-in-a-box server.
At this time we don’t have any information indicating the extent to which these domains have
been used maliciously.
