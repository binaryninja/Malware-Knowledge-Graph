II. Introduction

1/7

Arechclient2 is a .NET remote access trojan (RAT) that has numerous capabilities. The RAT
can profile victim systems, steal information like browser and crypto-wallet data, and launch
a hidden secondary desktop to control browser sessions.
III. Cyber Florida SOC Observations
Update 12/8/2022:
Cyber Florida identified additional content in analysis that was not previously reported. This
information pertains to network connections. Within utilizing the InstallUtil.exe binary to
execute code, the InstallUtil.exe process was observed reaching out to a pastebin[.]com
page. This page contained the CnC IP address. Additionally, the victim IP address (observed
in the UIP parameter) appears to be ascertained from the InstallUtil.exe process from
hxxp://eth0[.]me (which appears to be a site that identifies the visiting host’s IP address).
Original Post:
Cyber Florida has observed network payload data obfuscated via Base64 encoding and sent
to what appears to be a command control server. The command and control server appears
to be utilizing Google cloud services (googleusercontent.com). Within the Base64 data,
exfiltrated usernames and passwords were observed. Based on observations, the exfiltrated
data appears to be from cached browser credentials (Google Chrome profiles, Firefox
profiles, Microsoft Edge profiles, etc.) In reviewing logs and network traffic there were
parameters of interest within the data payload that would aid in identifying this activity. The
following payload parameters were observed the network traffic: ConnectionType, Client,
SessionID, BotName, Computer, BuildID, BotOS, URLData, UIP.
Based on observing network traffic for the command control communication, there may be
similarities associated to the Redline Stealer malware. See CERT Italy article. https://certagid.gov.it/news/scoperto-il-malware-redline-stealer-veicolato-come-lastpass/
Screenshot samples of log and network traffic have been provided in the appendix of this
report.
Some of the interesting evasion tactics Cyber Florida observed were the utilization of “sleep”
functions and the usage of .NET Framework’s InstallUtil.exe binary to communicate with the
command and control server. The “sleep” functionality appeared to delay the usage of
InstallUtil.exe. In testing, the Installutil.exe appeared to run in perpetuity regularly
communicating with the command and control server. In reviewing a few of the automated
sandboxes, the Installutil.exe activity was not identified. This may be due to the “sleep”
activity being utilized.
Another evasion tactic appears to be attempting to modify Windows Defender settings via
the second observed PowerShell instance. The cmdlet Set-MpPreference with the options –
ExclusionPath ‘C:’ was employed. This command appears to create a malware scan
exclusion, which would prevent Windows Defender from scanning the entire C: volume.

During initial malicious binary execution, a persistence mechanism was observed via the
common HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun location.
IV. Additional Background Information
Blackpoint Cyber discovered an ISO file that contained a malicious Windows executable that
was downloaded to a victim’s computer and was not detected by an antivirus program. A
malicious executable, named Setup.exe, was observed using various defense evasion
techniques including obfuscation, injection, and uncommon automation tools. These tools
were used to drop a RAT named Arechclient2 (Blackpoint Cyber). The size of Setup.exe is
over 300 megabytes (Blackpoint Cyber).
The initial attack vector that was used to send Setup.exe to the victim is unknown. This is the
execution step. When Setup.iso is double-clicked, the ISO file can be mounted like a CD
and, oftentimes, the contents of the file are automatically executed (Blackpoint Cyber).
Running Setup.exe will start the extraction of three files and execute multiple child processes
(Blackpoint Cyber). A new folder, IXP000.TMP, is made in the victim’s AppDataLocalTemp
directory and three files are created into the newly created directory: Funding.mpeg,
Mali.mpeg, and Dns.mpeg (Blackpoint Cyber).
The Dns.mpeg script is heavily obfuscated. The script searches for AvastUI.exe and
AVGUI.exe running on the victim’s computer. The two executables are found in the Avast
antivirus product line (Blackpoint Cyber). If those two executables are not found, Dns.mpeg
sets Hole.exe.pif to the name AutoIT3.exe. In the script .au3 (or d.au3) there are over 3,000
references to a function named Xspci(). This function takes a string as its first argument and
a number as its second argument. The function is responsible for decoding strings
(Blackpoint Cyber).
The .au3 script accomplishes three things through injection: 1. establishing persistence using
a URL file in the victim’s startup folder. 2. copying the ntdll.dll file from the
C:WindowsSysWOW64 folder to avoid antivirus hooks. 3. injecting the embedded payload
into jsc.exe (Blackpoint Cyber). The function that is responsible for the above tasks is
KXsObHGILZNaOurxqSUainCYU() which takes a pointer to the binary to be injected, a string

3/7

argument, and a string argument with the path to the binary that would be executed and
injected into as arguments (Blackpoint Cyber). The script establishes persistence by adding
a URL file to the victim’s startup folder that will execute a Microsoft Visual Basic Script (VBS)
on every login (Blackpoint Cyber).
Arechclient2 has a decompilation phase. Test.exe, a C# binary, can be loaded into tools that
statically and dynamically analyze code. One such tool is DnSpy (Blackpoint Cyber). The
class names in Test.exe were minimized to single and double characters to add an additional
layer of confusion for reverse engineers (Blackpoint Cyber). The actual name of Test.exe is
2qbarx12tqm.exe (Blackpoint Cyber). Arechclient2 also contains a command and control
(C2) phase. When Arechclient2 is executed, it connects to
https[:]//pastebin.com/raw/nJqnWX3u to collect C2 information (Blackpoint Cyber). The
requested file, nJqnWX3u, contains the IP address 34[.]141[.]198[.]105 as a string. It also
connects to http[:]//eth0.me to get its public IP address (Blackpoint Cyber). Arechclient2
connects to its C2 server on port 15647 to receive commands. The server responds with
information to control the encryption status (“On” or “Off”) in JSON format (Blackpoint Cyber).
If the communications are intercepted and the encryption is set to “Off,” further
communications will be in plaintext (Blackpoint Cyber).
V. MITRE ATT&CK
T1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell
is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in
the Windows operating system. Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number
of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code.
T1555.003 – Credentials From Web Browsers
Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the
target browser. Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames
and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future. Web
browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store;
however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.
T1547.001 – Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or
referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the “run keys” in the Registry
or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in.
These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the
account’s associated permissions level.
T1562.001 – Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools
Adversaries may modify and/or disable security tools to avoid possible detection of
their malware, tools, and activities. Adversaries may also tamper with artifacts
deployed and utilized by security tools. Security tools may make dynamic changes to
system components in order to maintain visibility into specific events.
4/7

T1218.004 – System Binary Proxy Execution: InstallUtil
Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows
utility. InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of
resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries. The
InstallUtil binary may also be digitally signed by Microsoft and located in the .NET
directories on a Windows system: C:WindowsMicrosoft.NETFramework vInstallUtil.exe
and C:WindowsMicrosoft.NETFramework64 vInstallUtil.exe.
T1095 –Non-Application Layer Protocol
Adversaries may use a non-application layer protocol for communication between host
and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network. The list of possible protocols
is extensive.
T1132.001 –Standard Encoding
Adversaries may encode data with a standard data encoding system to make the
content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect. Command and control
(C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system that adheres
to existing protocol specifications. Common data encoding schemes include ASCII,
Unicode, hexadecimal, Base64, and MIME.
VI. Recommendations
Phishing awareness training
Users should be informed and educated about new kinds of phishing scams currently
being used and ones that have been used in the past. Awareness training should
instruct users to avoid suspicious emails, links, websites, attachments, etc. Users
should also be educated about new types of attacks and schemes to mitigate risk.

Set antivirus programs to conduct regular scans
Ensure that antivirus and antimalware programs are scanning assets using up-to-date
signatures
Malware monitoring
Continuously monitor current and new types of malware. Stay up to date on intel and
advancements to prevent, defend, and mitigate these types of threats.
Strong cyber hygiene
Enforce a strong password policy across all networks and subsystems. Remind users
to be wary of any messages asking for immediate attention, links, downloads, etc. All
sources should be verified. Recommended link: https://uscert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-131a
Turn on endpoint protection
Enable endpoint detection and response (EDR) to stop unknown malware in the
product you’re using.
