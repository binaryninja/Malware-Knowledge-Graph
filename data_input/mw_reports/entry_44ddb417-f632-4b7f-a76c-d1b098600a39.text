Torpig, also known as Anserin or Sinowal is a type of botnet spread through systems
compromised by the Mebroot rootkit by a variety of trojan horses for the purpose of collecting
sensitive personal and corporate data such as bank account and credit card information. It
targets computers that use Microsoft Windows, recruiting a network of zombies for the
botnet. Torpig circumvents antivirus software through the use of rootkit technology and scans
the infected system for credentials, accounts and passwords as well as potentially allowing
attackers full access to the computer. It is also purportedly capable of modifying data on the
computer, and can perform man-in-the-browser attacks.
By November 2008, it was estimated that Torpig had stolen the details of about 500,000
online bank accounts and credit and debit cards and was described as "one of the most
advanced pieces of crimeware ever created".[1]

History
Torpig reportedly began development in 2005, evolving from that point to more effectively
evade detection by the host system and antivirus software.[2]
In early 2009, a team of security researchers from University of California, Santa Barbara
took control of the botnet for ten days. During that time, they extracted an unprecedented
amount (over 70 GB) of stolen data and redirected 1.2 million IPs on to their private
command and control server. The report[3] goes into great detail about how the botnet
operates. During the UCSB research team's ten-day takeover of the botnet, Torpig was able
to retrieve login information for 8,310 accounts at 410 different institutions, and 1,660 unique
credit and debit card numbers from victims in the U.S. (49%), Italy (12%), Spain (8%), and
40 other countries, including cards from Visa (1,056), MasterCard (447), American Express
(81), Maestro (36), and Discover (24).[4]

Operation
Initially, a great deal of Torpig's spread was attributable to phishing emails that tricked users
into installing the malicious software. More sophisticated delivery methods developed since
that time use malicious banner ads which take advantage of exploits found in outdated of
versions of Java, or Adobe Acrobat Reader, Flash Player, Shockwave Player. A type of
Drive-by download, this method typically does not require the user to click on the ad, and the
download may commence without any visible indications after the malicious ad recognizes

1/2

the old software version and redirects the browser to the Torpig download site. To complete
its installation into the infected computer's Master Boot Record (MBR), the trojan will restart
the computer.[2]
During the main stage of the infection, the malware will upload information from the computer
twenty minutes at a time, including financial data like credit card numbers and credentials for
banking accounts, as well as e-mail accounts, Windows passwords, FTP credentials, and
POP/SMTP accounts.[4]
