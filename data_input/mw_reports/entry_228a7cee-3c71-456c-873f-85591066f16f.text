Statement on Solar Winds Orion cyberattacks
15.04.2021

Poland has received with great concern the information provided by the U.S. Government
regarding the cyberattacks conducted by the Russian Federation using Solar Winds Orion
systems and software Fact Sheet. The impact of these attacks extends beyond the US and
affects European countries, among others. The steady increase in malicious activities in
cyberspace not only threatens the security and stability of the functioning of individual
entities or systems using digital technologies, but also has a harmful impact on societies,
economies or governments of many countries.
Poland stands solidary with the United States. Our position is expressed in the statements
of NATO and the European Union. We strongly advocate that states, the private sector and
individuals adhere to the principles of responsible behavior in cyberspace. This is a position
we have consistently presented at the EU, NATO, OSCE, UN and other international
organizations. Conducting or supporting malicious cyber activities by states, calls into
question their intentions as participants in international processes to strengthen
cybersecurity on a global scale.
