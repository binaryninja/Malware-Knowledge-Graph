Additional information for Enterprise users

In the wild, we have observed this threat infecting computers by targeting accounts that have
weak passwords.
To help prevent infection, and consequent reinfection, make sure that your organization uses
strong passwords for system and user accounts, and verifying that you do not use
passwords like those being used by the malware in order to spread. Changing your
password will significantly decrease your chance of re-infection.
To thwart this and similar threats, it helps to adhere to best password practices, defined and
enforced by appropriate policies. Good polices include, but are not limited to:
Ensuring there are rules around password complexity, so that passwords meet basic
strong password requirements, such as minimum length (long passwords are usually
stronger than short ones)
1/2

Ensuring passwords are not used for extended periods of time; consider setting an
expiry every 30 to 90 days. You might also consider enforcing password history, so that
users can not re-use the same password within a pre-defined time frame
Ensuring passwords contain a combination of:
Uppercase letters
Lowercase letters
Numerals, and
Symbols
For general information about password best practices, please see the following articles:
To help prevent re-infection after cleaning, you may also want to consider changing the
password for every account on the network, for every user in your environment.
