OSX Malware is Catching Up, and it wants to Read Your
HTTPS Traffic (updated)

People often assume that if you’re running OSX, you’re relatively safe from malware. But
this is becoming less and less true, as evidenced by a new strain of malware encountered
by the Check Point malware research team. This new malware – dubbed OSX/Dok —
affects all versions of OSX, has 0 detections on VirusTotal (as of the writing of these words),
is signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple), and is the first major
scale malware to target OSX users via a coordinated email phishing campaign.
Once OSX/Dok infection is complete, the attackers gain complete access to all victim
communication, including communication encrypted by SSL. This is done by redirecting
victim traffic through a malicious proxy server.
The malware mostly targets European users. For instance, one phishing message was
observed to target a user in Germany by baiting the user with a message regarding
supposed inconsistencies in their tax returns (see image, and translation, below).

Update – May-4-2017
Our ongoing investigation of the OSX/DOK campaign have led us to detect several new
variants of this malware.
Following Apple’s revocation of the previous developer ID, it seems the attackers have
quickly adapted and are now using a new Apple developer ID.

2/10

These new variants also contain an extra obfuscated layer using UPX in an attempt to avoid
security products detection.
Apple has been notified about these new developments, and the new developer ID has now
been revoked.
Check Point customers remain protected against these threats with the following detections:
Trojan.OSX.DOK
Trojan.OSX.DOK-Domain
Mac OSX/Dok Unauthorized Remote Access

Technical details:
The malware bundle is contained in a .zip archive named Dokument.zip. It was signed on
April 21th 2017 by a “Seven Muller” and the bundle name is Truesteer.AppStore.
Upon execution, the malware will copy itself to the /Users/Shared/ folder, and will then
proceed to execute itself from the new location by running the shell commands below:

Then, the malware will pop-up a fabricated message claiming that “the package is
damaged” and therefore cannot execute:

3/10

If a loginItem named “AppStore” exists, the malware will delete it, and instead add itself as a
loginItem, which will persist in the system and execute automatically every time the system
reboots, until it finishes to install its payload.

4/10

The malicious application will then create a window on top of all other windows. This new
window contains a message, claiming a security issue has been identified in the operating
system that an update is available, and that to proceed with the update, the user has to
enter a password as shown in the picture below. The malware checks the system
localization, and supports messages in both German and English.

The victim is barred from accessing any windows or using their machine in any way until
they relent, enter the password and allow the malware to finish installing. Once they do, the
malware gains administrator privileges on the victim’s machine.
Using those privileges, the malware will then install brew, a package manager for OS X,
which will be used to install additional tools – TOR and SOCAT
Tor, the latter is a low-level command-line utility that allows connection to the dark web.
The malware will then give the current user admin privileges immediately on demand
without prompting for a password. This is done so that the malware won’t provoke constant
admin password prompts when abusing its admin privileges with the sudo command. This
is done by adding the following line to /etc/sudoers:

The malware then changes the victim system’s network settings such that all outgoing
connections will pass through a proxy, which is dynamically obtained from a Proxy
AutoConfiguration (PAC) file sitting in a malicious server. The script that makes this
configuration changes can be seen below:

Then resulting change can be seen in the Network Settings:

6/10

The malware will then proceed to install a new root certificate in the victim system, which
allows the attacker to intercept the victim’s traffic using a Man in The Middle (MiTM) attack.
By abusing the victim’s new-found trust in this bogus certificate, the attacker can
impersonate any website, and the victim will be none the wiser. The new certificate is
installed using the following command:

The newly-installed certificate can be seen in the two images below.
The malware will also install 2 LaunchAgents that will start with system boot, and have
the following names:

7/10

These LaunchAgents will redirect requests to 127.0.0.1 through the dark web address
“paoyu7gub72lykuk.onion“. This is necessary for the previous PAC configuration to work
(note that the original configuration looks for the PAC file on the local host 127.0.0.1).
These LaunchAgents consist of the following BASH commands:

As a result of all of the above actions, when attempting to surf the web, the user’s web
browser will first ask the attacker web page on TOR for proxy settings. The user traffic is
then redirected through a proxy controlled by the attacker, who carries out a Man-In-theMiddle attack and impersonates the various sites the user attempts to surf. The attacker is
free to read the victim’s traffic and tamper with it in any way they please.
When done, the malware will delete itself.
All is left to say: beware of Trojans bearing gifts, especially if they ask for your root
password.
