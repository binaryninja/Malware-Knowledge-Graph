Executive Summary
As part of Unit 42’s commitment to stop ransomware attacks, we conduct ransomware
hunting operations to ensure our customers are protected against new and evolving
ransomware variants. We monitor the activity of existing groups, search for dark web leak
sites and fresh onion sites, identify up-and-coming players and study tactics, techniques and
procedures. During our operations, we have observed four emerging ransomware groups
that are currently affecting organizations and show signs of having the potential to become
more prevalent in the future:

1/20

AvosLocker is ransomware as a service (RaaS) that started operations in late June,
using a blue beetle logo to identify itself in communications with victims and “press
releases” aimed at recruiting new affiliates. AvosLocker was observed promoting its
RaaS program and looking for affiliates on dark web discussion forums and other
forums. Like many of its competitors, AvosLocker offers technical support to help
victims recover after they’ve been attacked with encryption software that the group
claims is “fail-proof,” has low detection rates and is capable of handling large files. This
ransomware also has an extortion site, which claims to have impacted six
organizations in the following countries: the U.S., the U.K., the U.A.E., Belgium, Spain
and Lebanon. We have observed initial ransom demands ranging from $50,000 to
$75,000.
Hive Ransomware is double-extortion ransomware that started operations in June.
Since then, Hive has impacted 28 organizations that are now listed on the group’s
extortion site, including a European airline company and three U.S.-based
organizations. Hive uses all tools available in the extortion toolset to create pressure on
the victim, including the date of initial compromise, countdown, the date the leak was
actually disclosed on their site, and even the option to share the disclosed leak on
social media.
HelloKitty is not a new ransomware group; it can be tracked as early as 2020, mainly
targeting Windows systems. However, in July, we observed a Linux variant of HelloKitty
targeting VMware’s ESXi hypervisor, which is widely used in cloud and on-premises
data centers. We also observed two clusters of activity. Across the observed samples,
some threat actors preferred email communications, while others used TOR chats for
communication with the victims. The observed variants impacted five organizations in
Italy, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.S. The highest ransom demand
observed from this group was $10 million, but at the time of writing, the threat actors
have only received three transactions that sum up to about $1.48 million.
LockBit 2.0 (previously known as ABCD ransomware) is a three-year-old RaaS
operator that has been linked to some high-profile attacks lately following the June
launch of a slick marketing campaign to recruit new affiliates. It claims to offer the
fastest encryption on the ransomware market. LockBit 2.0 has impacted multiple
industries – 52 victims are listed on the group’s leak site. Its victims include
organizations in the U.S., Mexico, Belgium, Argentina, Malaysia, Australia, Brazil,
Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Austria, Romania and the U.K.
Here, we share information we've gathered from our observations of the behavior of these
ransomware groups to help organizations defend against them.
Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from these threats
with Threat Prevention and WildFire security subscriptions. Customers are also protected
with Cortex XDR and can use AutoFocus for tracking related entities.

AvosLocker
2/20

AvosLocker is new ransomware that was first observed on July 4, 2021, and follows the
RaaS model. The ransomware operator of the same name, avos, advertised their affiliate
program on Dread (Figure 1). Dread is a Reddit-like dark web discussion forum featuring
news and sub-dreads around darknet markets. The announcement of the program includes
information about features of the ransomware and lets affiliates know that AvosLocker
operators will take care of negotiation and extortion practices. The user Avos has also been
observed trying to recruit individuals on the Russian forum XSS.

Figure 1. AvosLocker announcement in Dread.AvosLocker, when executed, first opens a
Windows shell showing the progress of the encryption process. After encryption is complete,
3/20

it then appends the .avos extension to the encrypted files and drops the ransom note
GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.TXT in every encrypted directory (Figure 2). We observed
another AvosLocker sample that behaves exactly the same way as the initial observed
sample, but also included a string called “Message from the agent” letting the victim know
their files were exfiltrated.

Figure 2a. AvosLocker ransom note

Figure 2b. Encrypted files.
The ransom note includes information and an ID used to identify victims, and instructs the
victim to visit the AvosLocker TOR site (Figure 3).

4/20

Figure 3. AvosLocker landing page.
After submitting the ID, the victim will encounter a support chat and the request for ransom.
From the available instances observed, we have seen payment requests as low as $50,000
and as high as $75,000 in Monero (XMR). As seen with other ransomware groups,
AvosLocker increases the ransom price if the victim doesn’t pay in the designated time
period, as shown in Figure 4.

5/20

Figure 4. AvosLocker support page.
While exploring their site, we discovered that this group has already affected seven
organizations: two law firms, one in the U.K. and one in the U.S.; a logistics company in
Spain; a real estate agency in Belgium; a holdings company in Turkey; a Syrian
transportation organization and a city in the U.S. Some of the leaked data displayed on their
site include private organization documents and personal identifiable information.
AvosLocker's first site post, on Jan. 1, 2021, was an announcement that the site was
officially online (Figure 5). The user avos also announced they started leaking data on
multiple sub-dreads as well. We believe this was done to attract more affiliates and traffic to
their site.

Hive Ransomware
Hive ransomware began operations in June 2021 and has already shown notable disregard
for its victims’ welfare, attacking organizations including healthcare providers and mid-size
organizations ill-equipped for managing a ransomware attack. Hive published their first victim
on their leak site, Hive Leaks, in late June (Figure 6). Since then, 28 victims have been
published on the Hive Leaks site, including a European airline company and three U.S.based organizations, one each in hardware retail, manufacturing and law. The posts include
the date and time the victim was affected.

Figure 6. Hive Leaks.
When this ransomware is executed, it drops two batch scripts. The first script, hive.bat, tries
to delete itself, and the second script is in charge of deleting the shadow copies of the
system (shadow.bat). Hive ransomware adds the [randomized characters].hive extension to
the encrypted files and drops a ransom note titled HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt containing
instructions and guidelines to prevent data loss (Figure 7). The ransom note includes a
generated login credential for the victim to chat with what the threat actors claim is their
“sales” department. The TOR link directs the “customer” to a login page, and after the
credentials are submitted, it opens up a chat room for communication between the operators
and the victim (Figure 8).

Figure 7. Hive ransom

note.
We noticed that the login credentials provided by the ransom note were for a specific victim.
With this in mind, we then hunted for additional samples and found two more victims that
were affected but not yet listed on the leak site at the time of writing. After logging in, the
victim will see a chat where they can talk to the operators and get their decryptors (Figure 8).

We don’t yet have information on how Hive ransomware is being delivered, but ransomware
operators are known for buying access to certain networks, brute-forcing credentials or
spear-phishing for initial access.

HelloKitty: Linux Edition
HelloKitty is a ransomware family that first surfaced at the end of 2020, primarily targeting
Windows systems. The malware family got its name due to its use of a Mutex with the same
name: HelloKittyMutex. The ransomware samples seem to evolve quickly and frequently,
with different versions making use of the .crypted or .kitty file extensions for encrypted files.
Some newer samples make use of a Golang packer that ensures the final ransomware code
is only loaded in memory, most likely to evade detection by security solutions.
In July 2021, we came across a Linux (ELF) sample with the name funny_linux.elf containing
a ransom note with verbiage that directly matched ransom notes seen in later samples of
HelloKitty for Windows. This led to the discovery of other samples of this Linux strain of the
HelloKitty ransomware, dating as far back as October 2020. However, starting in March, the
samples began targeting ESXi, a target of choice for recent Linux ransomware variants.
Oddly enough, the preferred mode of communication shared by attackers in the ransom
notes across the different samples is a mix between TOR URLs and victim-specific
Protonmail email addresses. This could indicate different campaigns or even entirely different
threat actors making use of the same malware codebase. Since the samples we found
contained victim-specific ransom notes, we were able to get an idea of the ransomware’s
targets. We observed six organizations impacted by Hello Kitty, including Italian and Dutch
pharmaceutical organizations, a Germany-based manufacturer, an Australian industrial
automation solutions organization, and a medical office and a stock broker in the U.S. One
sample, oddly enough, didn’t contain any contact information in its ransom note.
We also observed that the ransom demanded by the operator varies depending on the
impacted organization; we saw demands as high as $10 million and as low as $950,000 in
Monero (Figure 9). The operators behind HelloKitty are also open to using bitcoin (BTC), but
they charge higher for bitcoin transactions due to its associated fees. We were able to look
up the BTC wallet address they provided for victims
(bc1ql5f3m75qx3ueu2pz5eeveyqsw6pdjs3ufk8r20) and confirm that three transactions were
made to that address, summing up to $1,477,872.41.

Table 1. Arguments accepted by the Linux HelloKitty ransomware.

The following esxcli commands are executed to kill running VMs, when the k flag is set:
esxcli vm process list
esxcli vm process kill -t=soft -w=%d %(PID)
esxcli vm process kill -t=force -w=%d %(PID)
The malware samples log their output to a work.log file in their execution path.
Finally, the ransomware makes use of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
for encrypting files using functions from the shared library libcrypto.so for encryption. The
encrypted file is saved with the extension .crypt. Each encrypted file has a corresponding file
with the extension .README_TO_RESTORE containing the ransom note. Additional details
can be found in the appendix of this report.

LockBit 2.0
LockBit is another ransomware group that follows the RaaS model. According to their
website, this ransomware affiliate program has been active since September 2019. While
LockBit has been known for some time, we included this group in this blog because of their

11/20

recent evolution to LockBit 2.0. In June 2021, the operators behind this ransomware
revamped their site and rebranded as LockBit 2.0.
Since June 2021, they have compromised 52 organizations in accounting ,automotive,
consulting, engineering, finance, high tech, hospitality, insurance, law enforcement,l egal
services, manufacturing, non-profit energy, retail, transportation and logistics industries,
utilities in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany,
Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S. All the posts by the
threat actors on their leak site include a countdown until confidential information is released
to the public, which creates additional pressure on the victim (Figure 10).

Figure 10. Affiliation program description (left) and leak site (right).
The threat actors behind this ransomware claim that their current variant is the fastest
encryption software in operation. To attract more affiliates, they include a table comparing
different ransomware families, including their previous variant (Figure 11).

12/20

Figure 11. Encryption speeds comparison released by LockBit.
When LockBit is executed, it starts encrypting files and appends the .lockbit extension.
Additionally, the ransomware changes the icon of the encrypted file to the LockBit 2.0 logo
(Figure 12.b). After encryption is complete, LockBit then drops the ransom note titled,
Restore-My-Files.txt (Figure 12.a).

Figure 12b. Encrypted files.
Similar to REvil, LockBit 2.0 ransomware modifies the victim’s desktop wallpaper if the
encryption process is successful, making the victim aware of their compromise. The
wallpaper also includes an advertisement aimed at encouraging insider threats that all
organizations could fall prey to. (Figure 13).

14/20

Figure 13. Modified LockBit 2.0 wallpaper.
The advertisement states that the threat actors are interested in methods of access, such as
RDP, VPN and corporate email credentials. In exchange, they offer a cut of paid ransom.
If the victim wants to communicate with Lockbit operators to get their data back, the
operators include a “Decryption ID” and a TOR link (and their clearnet mirror: decoding[.]at)
on the ransom note. This information allows the user to log in and start the negotiation
process (Figure 14).

Conclusion
With major ransomware groups such as REvil and Darkside lying low or rebranding to evade
law enforcement heat and media attention, new groups will emerge to replace the ones that
are no longer actively targeting victims. Here, we shared information on some of the
observed malicious activity of the ransomware groups trying to become the next key players.
While LockBit and HelloKitty have been previously active, their recent evolution makes them
a good example of how old groups can re-emerge and remain persistent threats. Unit 42 will
continue to monitor these ransomware families – and new ones that may emerge in the
future.
