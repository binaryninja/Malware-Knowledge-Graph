An ex-U.S. ambassador to Russia, anti-corruption activists in Ukraine and election observers
in other parts of Eastern Europe were among the apparent targets of a suspected Russian
state-sponsored hacking effort, according to data linked to the spying operation that a
researcher shared with CyberScoop.

The list offers classic examples of organizations that Russian spies might want to infiltrate,
including those working to expose graft, combat disinformation and promote secure
elections. It also points to the persistent threats that small nonprofits face from wellresourced hackers, as well as the long-running alleged Russian efforts to undermine
democratic institutions.
Microsoft on May 27 said hackers had used a breached account belonging to the U.S.
Agency for International Development, a U.S. government agency, to send phishing emails
to some 3,000 email accounts at 150 organizations in 24 countries (U.S. officials estimated
an even broader set of targets: 7,000 accounts and 350 organizations.)
Microsoft blamed the same Russian hacking group that exploited SolarWinds software to
breach U.S. government agencies — a group the White House has tied to Russia’s SVR
foreign intelligence agency.
The U.S. government says it is still investigating the campaign impersonating USAID and
has yet to attribute the activity to a known group. Neither Microsoft nor U.S. officials named
the targets of the campaign.
Multiple employees at the Anti-Corruption Action Centre (AntAC), a non-governmental
organization that campaigns against corruption in Ukraine’s government, received phishing
emails, but none clicked on the malicious code, according to co-founder Vitaliy Shabunin.
AntAC is among “those who are pushing Ukraine out of the Russian sphere of influence,”
Shabunin said by phone from Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. “We are pushing these [democratic]
reforms to be part of the Western world.”
“It’s understandable for me why Russians would want to spy on us,” he said.
It is also just one organization targeted in a would-be digital dragnet.
By plugging files used in the hacking campaign to VirusTotal, a platform for analyzing
malicious code, Joe Slowik, a senior manager at security firm Gigamon, found email
addresses associated with the service that the attackers used to track the phishing emails.
Three other intelligence analysts corroborated Slowik’s findings.
Among the apparent intended recipients of the phishing campaign was Alexander “Sandy”
Vershbow, who was the deputy secretary general of North Atlantic Treaty Organization from
2012 to 2016 and the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2001 to 2005. Russia sees NATO as
a threat to its interests in Europe, and has allegedly used influence operations and hacking
to try to undermine the bloc.
Vershbow, now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, did not respond to a request for
comment. The Atlantic Council declined to comment.

Another apparent target of the hackers was an employee of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an inter-government organization that works on arms
control and police reform in former Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries. An OSCE
spokesperson said the organization was aware of the phishing attempts and was closely
monitoring the situation.
“Like many international organizations, the OSCE is a frequent target of cyber threats. It
takes such incidents very seriously,” the statement continued. “The OSCE takes all possible
measures to respond to and mitigate such attacks to protect all parts of the Organization.”
EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that pushed back on alleged Russian
disinformation activity around the coronavirus vaccine, was also an intended recipient of the
phishing emails, according to the Virus Total data. Alexandre Alaphilippe, EU DisinfoLab’s
executive director, declined to comment.
The Department of Homeland Security’s cyber division said May 29 that it had yet to see
“significant impact on federal government agencies” from the phishing campaign, while
Microsoft said May 28 there wasn’t evidence of “any significant number of compromised
organizations at this time.” The Justice Department on May 28 seized two internet domains
that, the department said, the hackers were using to distribute and control their malicious
code.
The seizure “was aimed at disrupting the malicious actors’ follow-on exploitation of victims,
as well as identifying compromised victims,” the Justice Department said in a press release.
“However, the actors may have deployed additional backdoor accesses between the time of
the initial compromises and last week’s seizures.”
Russian government officials routinely deny involvement in hacking operations, including the
campaign that exploited software made by U.S. federal contractor SolarWinds.
For Shabunin, though, it is familiar territory.
“We are pretty aware of such kinds of threats, and we have training all the time and the
protocols to deal with them,” said Shabunin, whose house was burned down last year in
apparent retaliation for his anti-corruption work.
Shabunin wants other NGOs to be vigilant. He said the phishing lure sent by the hackers,
which referenced conspiracy theories pushed by former President Donald Trump, would be
bizarre coming from USAID. The agency funds some of AntAC’s work, but doesn’t dabble in
partisan politics.
Some U.S. lawmakers reacted with anger to the latest alleged Russian hacking, with the
House Intelligence Committee chairman floating the idea of tightening sanctions. But the
apparent target list reflects the type of Russian spying that has been going on for decades

rather than any sort of escalation in cyberspace with the Biden administration. It also shows
that U.S. officials have to be wary of Russian espionage long after they’ve left public service.
As for Shabunin, his organization is busy preparing to host a conference next week on
disinformation threats to democracy with the presidents of Ukraine and Moldova.
“It’s part of [the] job,” Shabunin said of dealing with cyberthreats.
