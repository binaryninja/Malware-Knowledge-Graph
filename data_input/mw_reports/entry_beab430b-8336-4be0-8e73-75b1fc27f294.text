Compass points and
decoder keys
Welcome to the Cyber-Espionage Report (CER),
our first-ever data-driven publication on
advanced cyberattacks. The CER is one of the
most comprehensive overviews of the CyberEspionage landscape, offering a deep dive into
attackers, their motives, their methods and the
victims who they target. The report serves as a
tool for better understanding these threat actors
and what organizations can do to hunt, detect
and respond to Cyber-Espionage attacks.
This data-driven report draws from seven years
of Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)
content as well as more than 14 years of Verizon
Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC)
Cyber-Espionage data breach response
expertise. The CER serves as a guide for
cybersecurity professionals looking to bolster
their organization’s cyberdefense posture and
incident response (IR) capabilities against
Cyber-Espionage attacks.
More specifically, the CER is an elaboration of
the “Cyber-Espionage” Incident Classification
Pattern as reflected in the 2020 DBIR. And as
with the DBIR, we use the same naming
conventions, terms and definitions. Content in
this section and in “Appendix A: Frameworks”
will help serve as your compass points and
decoder keys for the rest of the report. Download
a copy of the CER at verizon.com/business/
resources/reports/cyber-espionage-report/

Data Breach Investigations Report
The 2020 DBIR is our 13th edition, covering global
cybercrime trends. The DBIR combines real data from scores
of sources and provides actionable insight into tackling
cybercrime. Download the 2020 DBIR here:
enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/

VERIS framework
The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing
(VERIS) framework is a set of metrics designed to provide
a common language for describing security incidents in
a structured and repeatable manner. See “Appendix A:
Frameworks” for more information and read more about
VERIS at the link below:

Incident Classification Patterns
Way back in 2014, to help us better understand and
communicate the DBIR dataset, we grouped “like” incidents
together and called them “Incident Classification Patterns.”
Nine patterns comprised the majority of data breaches back
then and still do so today. These patterns are Crimeware,
Cyber-Espionage, Denial of Service, Lost and Stolen Assets,
Miscellaneous Errors, Payment Card Skimmers, Point of
Sale, Privilege Misuse, Web Applications and the catchall
Everything Else. For definitions and summaries, see pages 36
to 37 of the 2020 DBIR.

Using this report

Cyber-Espionage pattern

Throughout the CER, we present and compare findings
from a seven-year perspective (content from the 2014 DBIR
through the 2020 DBIR): Cyber-Espionage breaches vs. all
breaches. At times, we also address findings from a one-year
(2020 DBIR) perspective: Cyber-Espionage breaches vs. all
breaches. All references to years in this report are in DBIR
years. For example, “2020 DBIR timeframe” refers to DBIR
year 2020, which in turn correlates with the DBIR dataset
timeframe of October 2018 to October 2019.

The DBIR Cyber-Espionage pattern consists of espionage
enabled via unauthorized network or system access. Nationstate or state-affiliated threat actors looking for those oh-sojuicy secrets primarily fall within this pattern.

2020-2021 Cyber-Espionage Report

Industry labels
We align the CER with the North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS), a standard for categorizing
victim organizations. NAICS uses two- to six-digit codes to
classify organizations. For the CER, we use the two-digit
classification level. We provide detailed analyses for seven
NAICS-coded industries in “Appendix B: Industry dossiers.”
Detailed information on the codes is available here:

State of CyberEspionage
Overview
We’ve conducted all sorts of investigations into cybersecurity
incidents and data breaches over the years. None have been
more challenging or perplexing than Cyber-Espionage attacks.
Indeed, Cyber-Espionage threat actors pose a unique
challenge to cyberdefenders and incident responders.
Through advanced techniques and a specific focus, these
determined threat actors seek to swiftly and stealthily gain
access to heavily defended environments. Depending on
their goals, they move laterally through the network, obtain
targeted access and data, and exit without being detected.
Or, they stay back and maintain covert persistence.
Often, threat actors leave little to no indication of their
actions, let alone objectives, to avoid detection and thwart
response efforts. Many choose not to move immediately
toward their objectives, opting to embed themselves in the
environment where they persist quietly until their next move.
Threat actors conducting espionage can range from nationstates (or state-affiliated entities) to business competitors,
and in some cases, organized criminal groups. Their targets
are both the public sector (governments) and private sector
(corporations). Their reasons? National security, political
positioning and economic competitive advantage. They seek
national secrets, intellectual property and sensitive information.
The Cyber-Espionage threat actor modus operandi includes
gaining unauthorized access, maintaining a low (or no) profile
and compromising sensitive assets and data. Technology
makes espionage actors fast, efficient, evasive and difficult to
attribute. In a nutshell, for the threat actor, Cyber-Espionage
is an opportunity with relatively low risk (of being discovered),
low cost (in terms of resources) and high potential (for payoff).

“The internet has made us richer, freer,
connected and informed in ways its founders
could not have dreamt of. It has also become a
vector of attack, espionage, crime and harm.”
George Osborne, British Politician and Newspaper Editor1
In seeking to accomplish their objectives, Cyber-Espionage
threat actors leverage three primary actions:
• Social engineering by targeting employees through
activities such as phishing
• Hacking systems and networks by using backdoors and
command and control (C2) functions to establish and
maintain access
• Deploying malicious software, such as Trojan downloaders,
to extend their capabilities
Within the DBIR dataset, we identified the industries most
impacted over the past seven years (2014-2020 DBIR
timeframe) by Cyber-Espionage breaches: Education, Financial,
Information, Manufacturing, Mining + Utilities, Professional and
Public. We focused on these industries because they were the
most often targeted by these threat actors.
Now, if your industry isn’t featured within this report, you’re
not off the hook. Cyber-Espionage threat actors may still
be targeting your assets and data—we may just not have
visibility into those attacks. If you’ve got sensitive, classified,
proprietary or internal secrets that you’d like to keep from
getting into the wrong hands, turn the page and read on.

2020-2021 Cyber-Espionage Report

The ever-evolving
threat landscape
To stay ahead of cyberdefenders and incident responders,
Cyber-Espionage threat actors adjust their tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) to embrace new technology, while
keeping their tried-and-true TTPs operational. Here we map
those TTPs to the VERIS Action varieties to give you an idea of
what is in and what is out.
For example, Phishing (Social) and Backdoor (Malware) have
served as go-to Action varieties. Downloader (Malware),
Capture stored data (Malware) and Spyware/Keylogger
(Malware) have all steadily declined from the 2014 DBIR to
the 2020 DBIR, with Scan network (Malware) completely
falling off the top 10 list by the time we get to the 2020 DBIR.
Password dumper (Malware), Trojan (Malware) and Remote
Access Trojan (RAT) (Malware) are new to the 2020 DBIR
top 10 list. And, while we see that since the 2014 DBIR,
Backdoor (Malware), Use of backdoor or C2 (Malware) and
C2 (Malware) have declined percentagewise over the years,
these Action varieties consistently remain within the top five
Action varieties for the entire timeframe.

Patterns
Breach patterns
When it comes to overall breaches by
Incident Classification Pattern for the
2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see that
Cyber-Espionage ranks sixth (10%)—
albeit within close striking distance of
fourth: Privilege Misuse (ranked fourth
at 11%) and the sagging Point of Sale
intrusions (ranked fifth at 11%).

0%

It is important to note that these
Incident Classification Patterns
are just those known, reported and
collected. Because Cyber-Espionage
attacks are difficult to detect, and
the breaches within this pattern are
under-reported, the number may be
much higher. The kinds of data stolen
in Cyber-Espionage breaches (e.g.,
Secrets, Internal or Classified) may not

2020-2021 Cyber-Espionage Report

Timelines
Traditionally, for all breaches, the DBIR
has shown that successful threat actors
have taken a short amount of time
(seconds to minutes) to compromise,
and a relatively short amount of time
(minutes to days) to exfiltrate data.

Attacker timelines
One of the most effective ways to
convey the current state of data
breaches and their impact to victim
organizations is through temporal
analysis or timelining.

Victim organizations have taken
considerably longer (days to months)
to discover breaches, and an
uncomfortably long time (hours to
weeks) to contain breaches.

When we look at the DBIR dataset, four
timelines manifest most clearly. Two
are from the threat actor standpoint—
Time to Compromise and Time to
Exfiltration—and two are from the
cyberdefender and incident responder
standpoint—Time to Discovery and
Time to Containment.

In the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, for
Cyber-Espionage threat actors, the
Time to Compromise ranges from mere
seconds to days (91%, the sum of 23%,
19%, 23% and 26%), while the Time
to Exfiltration ranges from minutes to
weeks (88%).

While the timelines for all breaches
may seem bleak, the same timelines
for Cyber-Espionage breaches appear
even more dire.

Moreover, this is indicative of the
threat actor’s due diligence to not only
understand their target’s environment
and cybersecurity posture, but also to
leverage that knowledge to accomplish
their objectives without detection.

Defender timelines
When we look closer, for
cyberdefenders, we see the Time to
Discovery within Cyber-Espionage
breaches is months to years (69%, the
sum of 30% and 39%) and the Time
to Containment ranges from hours to
weeks (64%, the sum of 10%, 25%
and 29%).

Targeted victims
NIST CSF Identify
Develop an organizational understanding
to manage cybersecurity risk to systems,
people, assets, data and capabilities.
A fundamental requirement for a solid
information security posture is identifying
assets before the adversary does. It’s
only when the unknowns become known
that assets and data can be protected.
After all, you don’t know—and cannot
protect—what you don’t know.
Asset identification is a foundational
part of the risk management process,
which aims to define and prioritize risks
for an organization. Risk managers often
build matrices listing threats in order
of severity. They also classify assets
in terms of confidentiality, integrity and
availability (referred to as the “CIA Triad”);
consider the impact of security breaches
on the organization; and estimate the
likelihood of certain incidents.
Risk management also requires an
organization to identify asset owners
and asset access controls. Asset
identification and risk management
should align with the organization’s
business objectives to add value to
the business and help gain buy-in
from decision makers. For example,
a business-driven risk management
strategy could include:
• Defining objectives
• Identifying assets and threats
• Selecting and prioritizing targets
• Monitoring and detecting threats
• Responding and improving response
capabilities
While it can be an overwhelming task
to start from scratch, it’s possible to
develop a risk management process
with smaller objectives by incorporating
cyber threat intelligence and building
and refining from there.

9

An organization that leverages cyber
threat intelligence to prioritize CyberEspionage attacks as part of its
risk management process can start
by asking questions relevant to the
organization, such as:
• How prevalent are Cyber-Espionage
attacks compared to other
cybersecurity attack patterns?
• Which Cyber-Espionage threat
actors have been targeting other
similar organizations? Based on this,
how likely is the organization to be
targeted?
• What assets and data are CyberEspionage threat actors targeting?
• What are the common TTPs of
Cyber-Espionage threat actors?
If the answers to these questions
point to lower risk, does it mean that in
some industries, such as Healthcare
or Accommodation, organizations
should not be concerned with CyberEspionage? Not at all. This data
shouldn’t be analyzed without context.
For example, while the number of CyberEspionage breaches may be lower in
some industries, the impact of sensitive
or proprietary data exposure on an
organization in one of those lessertargeted industries could be substantial.
Long story short: Just because your
organization’s industry has not been
a typical target for Cyber-Espionage
threat actors doesn’t mean it won’t be,
can’t be or hasn’t been.
To contextualize information for an
organization, it’s not uncommon
to deploy an internal cyber threat
intelligence team or to wholly or partly
outsource this capability.

Identification tips
• Identify assets, asset owners
and asset access controls
as part of an effective
and comprehensive risk
management strategy
• Align risk management with
the organization’s business
objectives to add business
value and gain buy-in from
decision makers
• Leverage cyber threat
intelligence to help prioritize
Cyber-Espionage attacks as
part of the risk management
process
• Avoid complacency.
Cyber-Espionage attacks
can potentially impact all
organizations—even those in
lesser-targeted industries

VERIS and the Center for Internet
Security (CIS) Critical Security
Controls (CSCs), as well as the
VERIS Common Attack Framework
(VCAF)—a VERIS-to-MITRE ATT&CK®
Framework introduced in the 2020
DBIR—are publicly available resources
for formalizing incident and threat
data. VERIS helps categorize security
incidents, while CIS CSCs help focus
on cybersecurity controls.
Risk analysis, asset identification and
incident classification can inform the
appropriate measures for preventing,
mitigating, detecting and responding
to threat actors while also maintaining
the ability to meet organizational
business objectives.

2020-2021 Cyber-Espionage Report

Regions
For the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see Cyber-Espionage breaches occurring
most often in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region (42%), followed by the Europe, Middle
East and Africa (EMEA) region (34%), and North America (NA) (23%) region.
This contrasts sharply with all breaches for this same timeframe, as NA (65%)
dominates, followed by APAC (17%) and EMEA (16%).

Industries
Overall Cyber-Espionage breaches within
select industries
One way to identify industries impacted by CyberEspionage attacks is by examining overall Cyber-Espionage
breach numbers.
When we look at how the industries that were featured
in the 2020 DBIR fared when it comes to CyberEspionage breaches, we can see that some were more
strongly impacted than others. In particular, Public (31%),
Manufacturing (22%) and Professional (11%) topped the list
for Cyber-Espionage breaches.
This is a good time to point out that the DBIR dataset can
only tell us what the DBIR dataset knows. The DBIR dataset
consists of successful, reported and known data breaches
(and cybersecurity incidents). It doesn’t cover undiscovered,
unreported or uncollected data (i.e., data originating outside
of the 81 contributors to the 2020 DBIR).
While we have included more detailed, industry-specific
Cyber-Espionage profiles in “Appendix B: Industry dossiers,”
here we provide insight into seven industries. These sectors
are the most impacted by Cyber-Espionage breaches over
the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe and have sufficient content
for analysis Industry (NAICS #): Education (61), Financial (52),
Information (51), Manufacturing (31-33), Mining + Utilities
(21+22), Professional (54) and Public (92).

Cyber-Espionage breaches within all breaches
of select industries
Another way to look at industries impacted by CyberEspionage attacks is the number of Cyber-Espionage
breaches within all breaches. For the 2014-2020 DBIR
timeframe, we see Manufacturing (35%), Mining + Utilities
(23%), Public (23%), Professional (17%), Education (8%),
Information (7%) and Financial (2%) for percentage of CyberEspionage breaches within all breaches by industry.
We include more detailed, industry-specific CyberEspionage profiles in “Appendix B: Industry dossiers.”
Here we provide insight into Breaches by pattern, CyberEspionage within all breaches, Actors within CyberEspionage, Actions within Cyber-Espionage, Assets within
Cyber-Espionage and compromised data within CyberEspionage for these seven industries.
Note: In Figure #16 and Figure #17, numbers in parentheses
after each industry correspond to the 2-digit NAICS #.

Essential Elements of
Friendly Information
NIST CSF Protect
Develop and implement appropriate
safeguards to ensure delivery of
critical services.
Sophisticated threat actors often use
stealthy methods to perpetrate CyberEspionage attacks. These methods
can include utilizing compromised
administrative credentials or
leveraging dual-use tools that blend in
with the environment.
These threat actors also deploy custom
zero-day malware, which antivirus
or other alerting software cannot
detect. From our experience, CyberEspionage attacks—using sophisticated
techniques; taking steps to avoid
detection; and having specific, targeted
objectives—tend to be considerably
more difficult to detect and investigate
than other breaches. Nevertheless,
there are ways to protect against them
even without specific knowledge of
their custom/zero-day nature.

Access control
With administrative permissions and
a flat (i.e., unsegmented) network, a
threat actor has the freedom to roam.
Even in segmented networks, a threat
actor can find their way to the coveted
data utilizing mapping and other dualuse tools. Network segmentation, strict
access controls, layered security (the
more access controls the better), a
least-privilege practice and multifactor
authentication for lateral movement into
critical data areas can all help safeguard
against Cyber-Espionage attacks.

Awareness and training

Protective technology

As seen in the 2020 DBIR, CyberEspionage attacks rely heavily on Social
and Malware combined vectors, using
Phishing in 81% of the incidents and
some form of Malware in 92%. Training
end users to recognize and report social
attacks, such as phishing or pretexting,
can help reduce poor outcomes related
to Cyber-Espionage attacks.

Some Cyber-Espionage protective
measures can be automated. Data
Leakage Prevention (DLP) solutions
send alerts when data leaves the
network. These solutions also offer
a large variety of features, such as
detecting or blocking data copied to
external locations, sent by email, or
shared using file-sharing apps and
sites; preventing protected data from
being printed; and more. DLP solutions
can even help identify unencrypted
data destinations.

Data security
Secure the data that is most valuable
and sought after by cyber threat
actors. Compile a critical data inventory
and implement access controls and
monitoring to ensure that data is safe.

Processes and procedures
Appropriately crafted corporate
processes and procedures can help
protect sensitive data. These should
cover everything from ensuring that
user devices are protected with
encryption and strong passwords to
restricting the use of public Wi-Fi and
determining how sensitive data should
be securely transmitted. Security
practices should ensure safe and
closely controlled access to potentially
vulnerable data.

Maintenance
Cyber-Espionage risk mitigation is far
from a set-it-and-forget-it strategy.
Regular maintenance should be
performed to ensure that employees
follow proper cybersecurity measures
and procedures so that data is protected.

Protection tips
• Safeguard against CyberEspionage attacks with
network segmentation,
strict access controls,
layered security, a leastprivilege practice and
multifactor authentication
for lateral movement into
critical data areas
• Train end users to recognize
and report social attacks,
such as phishing or pretexting
• Compile a critical data
inventory and implement
access controls and
monitoring to ensure that
data is safe
• Implement DLP solutions to
detect and prevent sensitive
data from being exported,
shared or copied

Attributes
Compromised Attributes
In the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, for both Cyber-Espionage
breaches and all breaches, the top compromised Attribute is
Confidentiality (100%). This is by definition. For an incident to
meet the VERIS requirement for breach classification, it has
to exhibit a confirmed data compromise, which equates with
Confidentiality. Thus, all Cyber-Espionage breaches impact
the Confidentiality attribute.

Integrity (95%) and Availability (1%) follow Confidentiality for
Cyber-Espionage breaches. Integrity, because Social actions
impact the person targeted (Alter behavior), and Malware
actions impact the asset where it was installed (Software
installation). These two are among the favorite TTPs of the
Cyber-Espionage threat actor. In contrast, most of these
attacks do not affect the availability of the asset—as that
would likely lead to faster discovery of the threat actor.

Assets and vulnerabilities
Critical assets

Targeted vulnerabilities

Significant research and analysis have focused on
developing models aimed at helping organizations identify,
measure and monitor the criticality of their assets. These
models, such as the NIST IR 8179 (Criticality Analysis
Process Model), are aimed at helping organizations better
identify, understand and protect their assets.

Vulnerabilities occupy a huge amount of mindshare in
information security. Security researchers, independent
hackers, nation-state actors, organized criminal groups,
customers and even employees discover thousands of
vulnerabilities every year (https://www.cvedetails.com/
browse-by-date.php).

This approach focuses on not only the asset’s criticality to
business operations but also the potential damage/impact of
the loss of the asset. However, many such analytical models
tend to view assets through a single lens and don’t necessarily
assess them through the prism of Cyber-Espionage.

Some discovered vulnerabilities are reported responsibly
and some (including their exploit code) are stashed away
for a multitude of reasons (most of which are nefarious in
nature). Most application software and firmware vendors
have established formal programs to release patches on a
periodic basis, or on an emergency basis depending on the
severity of the vulnerability.

This nuance is particularly important when two factors are
considered. First, while the overall significance of CyberEspionage as a whole is relatively low and appears to be
decreasing (as indicated in the 2020 DBIR), a by-industry
breakdown reveals a more nuanced picture.
Reported instances of Cyber-Espionage breaches
have been concentrated in certain industries (such as
Manufacturing, Mining + Utilities and Public), while other
industries (Construction, Real Estate) reported none at all
(note that this doesn’t necessarily mean none occurred
or that there is no risk for those particular industries, just
that none were reported where we had visibility). This
implies that any organization’s critical asset/sensitive data
management strategy may need to adjust to the CyberEspionage risk associated with their particular vertical.
It’s reasonable to assume that the overall Cyber-Espionage
rate suffers from chronic underreporting. Other motivations
(i.e., Financial) lend themselves toward having a more clearly
identifiable end state. Cyber-Espionage, on the other hand,
can potentially be associated with longer attack timelines
and potentially unending exploitation.
In self-assessing critical assets and sensitive data,
organizations need to ensure that their assessment criteria
account for the possibility of Cyber-Espionage. Specifically,
their model should address:
1. Overall Cyber-Espionage risk
2. Assets/data susceptible to Cyber-Espionage
3. Safeguards and monitoring to alert on
Cyber-Espionage attacks
4. Preventative measures for Cyber-Espionage, such as:
a. Continuous critical asset/sensitive data identification,
protection and monitoring
b. Cyber threat intelligence/dark web research/
threat hunting
c. Insider Threat Program
d. Competitive landscape awareness (i.e., unexpected loss
of competitive advantage)

17

Periodically, organizations discover scores of known
vulnerabilities within their infrastructure using typical
vulnerability scanning tools and patch them based on risk
assessment. However, threat actors leverage a relatively
small percentage of these vulnerabilities in breaches, as you
can see in the diagram below from the 2020 DBIR.

Figure #26: Vulnerability exploitation over time in breaches
Zero-day vulnerability exploits—those security weaknesses
not disclosed to vendors or developers—make tackling
vulnerabilities even harder for impacted organizations. More
often than not, the exploitation of such vulnerabilities doesn’t
leave credible evidence on the system (although there may
be some circumstantial evidence left somewhere else).
There were times when zero-day vulnerabilities were for
sale on the dark web. Due to recent enforcement actions by
some marketplace operators, the not-so-good researchers
have become less active and have possibly moved to other
avenues for financial gain and other motives. We’ve seen—
and continue to see—organized crime syndicates or nationstate and state-affiliated actors use zero-day vulnerabilities
to exploit systems for nefarious purposes.
It is important to realize that vulnerabilities are here to stay,
and the typical patch-cycle mentality cannot solve this
problem. A multilayered approach consisting of several
controls, such as robust risk management, use of strict
least-privilege principle, application whitelisting, threat
hunting and deception-based detection techniques, can
help protect against the invisible monster.

Cyber-Espionage breaches—Short term

All breaches—Short term

The top compromised Data varieties for Cyber-Espionage
breaches for the 2020 DBIR timeframe are data types that
fall outside regulatory reporting requirements: Credentials
(56%), Secrets (49%), Internal (12%) and Classified (7%), with
Bank (6%), Source code (6%) and Digital certificate (6%) all
statistically tied for fifth. In addition, much like the 2014-2020
DBIR timeframe, this makes sense for Cyber-Espionage
breaches, as threat actors would seek these Data varieties for
competitive gain.

When we look at compromised Data varieties for the 2020
DBIR timeframe, a different story emerges for all breaches.
We find Personal (58%), Credentials (41%), Internal (17%) and
Medical (16%) as the top compromised Data varieties for all
breaches, with Payment (12%) and Bank (11%) bringing up the
rear. With the exception of Credentials, these Data varieties
align with regulatory reporting for data breaches in general.

these data types are ostensibly sought after by threat actors
targeting sensitive/propriety/classified information.

For all breaches, we see Credentials (31%), Personal (31%),
Payment (23%), Medical (13%) and Internal (13%) as more
valuable targets for compromised Data varieties. Moreover,
this is understandable because, with the exception of

NIST CSF Detect
Develop and implement appropriate
activities to identify the occurrence of a
cybersecurity event.
The 2016 DBIR reported that, in general,
victim organizations seldom detect data
breaches. Rather, external sources are
more likely to make the discovery. This
trend remains the same even years later
in the 2020 DBIR and is especially true
for Cyber-Espionage breaches in the
2014-2020 DBIR timeframe. These
breaches tend to allow the adversary to
siphon as much information as possible
from their victim for as long as possible
while remaining undetected.
The questions for organizations in
2016 were how could an organization
improve its Time to Discovery trend?
How can it avoid relying mostly on
external sources that lie beyond its
control? How can it detect intrusions
as they occur if not before they occur?
These questions led to innovation in the
detection-technology space, which we
cover later in the report.
However, despite some organizations
adopting these new technologies, the
problem remains. A possible explanation
is that these new techniques often
rely on the organization having first
covered the basics, such as determining
network activity baselines, defining
cybersecurity incidents and specifying
alert thresholds, which isn’t always
the case.

Before investing in new technology,
an organization should verify that its
cybersecurity foundations are solid.
Security strategists can accomplish
this by adopting the Capability Maturity
Model (CMM) strategy, originally
developed to improve software
development processes. The CMM
relies on measuring, controlling and
regularly updating documentation and
processes to limit the unknowns.
During VTRAC data breach
investigations, crucial data is often
unavailable. Gaps come in the form
of missing log files, undocumented
systems, poor data accessibility,
network traffic flows, operational
practices, and underestimated or underdocumented data-sensitivity issues.
This lack of information not only
hinders a data breach investigation and
subsequent incident response efforts,
but it also creates golden opportunities
for the adversary to easily find and
access potentially sensitive information.
One way to address the gap between
compromise and detection speed in
breaches involving adversaries using
evasion tactics is to enhance detection
capabilities while keeping up with new
evasion techniques. Organizations
should develop defensive capabilities,
such as counterespionage deception
techniques, specifically to reflect these
emerging evasion TTPs.

The last few years have seen the
development and enhancement of
both network and host detection and
prevention systems. These have been
re-envisioned as Endpoint Detection
and Response (EDR) and Network
Detection and Response (NDR)
solutions. Event and telemetry data
from these systems typically roll up
into Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) and Security
Orchestration, Automation, and
Response (SOAR) solutions to trigger
response and containment, eradication,
remediation and recovery actions.
These technologies have moved
beyond outdated signature-based
detection toward behavior-pattern
detection enhanced with cyber threat
intelligence, automation, and machine
learning or artificial intelligence (i.e.,
statistical analysis and anomaly
detection). Solutions also facilitate
proactive analysis, often referred to as
“security health checks.”
It’s also important to remember that
having the best technology in your
arsenal doesn’t help unless you have
equally mature processes as well as
suitably skilled and trained personnel to
manage it effectively.

Detection tips

20

• Verify that the organization’s cybersecurity foundations
are solid by adopting the CMM strategy

• Develop counterespionage detection techniques that
evolve to reflect emerging evasion TTPs

• Ensure the availability of crucial data by reducing
the incidence of missing log files, undocumented
systems, poor data accessibility, network traffic flows,
operational practices, and underestimated or underdocumented data-sensitivity issues

• Move toward behavior-pattern detection enhanced with
cyber threat intelligence, automation, and solutions
based on machine learning or artificial intelligence
• Leverage experienced security professionals to
manage advanced technology

2020-2021 Cyber-Espionage Report

Discovery methods
In terms of top Discovery methods for Cyber-Espionage
breaches in the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, we see the
top two methods as Suspicious traffic (48%) and Antivirus
(23%), with Emergency response team a distant third (7%).
This contrasts sharply with the top Discovery methods for
all breaches for the same timeframe, in which we see Law
enforcement (28%), Fraud detection (19%) and Customer
(15%), respectively, at the top.
When we put on the threat actor “motive filter,” this makes
sense. Data breaches overall are dominated by the Financial
motive, whereas Cyber-Espionage breaches align with the
Espionage motive, which is much more targeted in its approach.
A factor at play here is that the Financial motive threat
actor has to contend with the Payment Card Industry (PCI)
Common Point of Purchase (CPP) fraud detection system.
There is no corresponding detection service looking for theft
of trade secrets, which contributes to longer discovery times.

When we look at Cyber-Espionage breaches for the 20142020 DBIR timeframe, External actors (State-affiliated,
Nation-state, Organized crime, Former employee and
Competitor combined) are at 100%. This makes sense, as

Figure #33: Actors over time for all breaches (2014-2020 DBIR)

Actor varieties
Attempting to identify Actor varieties is an immense
challenge in cyberspace. Threat actors go to great lengths
to maintain anonymity, obfuscate their activities and
impede identification using bogus IP addresses (even
MAC addresses can be spoofed), domain names, email
addresses, file names and malware tools, among other
indicators of compromise (IoCs).
The top Actor varieties in Cyber-Espionage breaches for the
2014-2020 DBIR timeframe are State-affiliated (85%), Nationstate (8%), Organized crime (4%) and Former employee (2%).
This should be no surprise, as State-affiliated and Nation-state
threat actors align more with the Espionage motive.
For all breaches during this same timeframe, we see a bit of
a different picture, with Organized crime (59%) dominating
the list of Actor varieties, followed by State-affiliated (13%),
Unaffiliated (7%), and then End-user (6%) and System admin
(4%). Organized crime has been identified mainly with the
Financial motive, one that continues to dominate our DBIR
dataset for all breaches over the years.

Threat actors defined
Threat actors are entities that cause or contribute
to a data breach or cybersecurity incident. External
actors originate from outside the organization
and its network of partners and typically have no
trust or privilege granted to them. Internal actors
originate from within the organization and enjoy
some level of trust and privilege. Partner actors
include any third party that shares a business
relationship with the organization and thus enjoys
some level of trust and privilege.

The labyrinth:
How attribution could be wrong
Digital forensic investigations should
ideally answer the five Ws (who, what,
where, when and why) and one H (How)
questions. However, challenges related
to the availability and granularity of
detail in evidentiary data can leave
many questions unanswered.
Cyberattack attribution in particular
is meant to address the “Who” and
“Why” questions. Investigators focus
on threat actor TTPs, consult cyber
threat intelligence reports and review
IoCs to root out perpetrators and
mount a defense.
However, IoCs such as IP addresses,
domain names, file names, malware
behavior and binary code sections
can be misleading. Consequently,
investigators shouldn’t rely only on
these to make a cyberattack attribution.
The current geopolitical climate,
recent pandemic and heightened
trade tensions provide a conducive
environment for cyberattack
misattribution. This is especially true for
Cyber-Espionage attacks that typically
involve tactics such as leveraging
covert TTPs and “false flags.” Threat
actors associated with these attacks
are attempting to thwart detection and
response efforts, as well as conceal
attack attribution for political and
national security purposes.

23

On top of that, Tor (The Onion
Router) networks, the dark web,
business infrastructures that lack
security, and privacy legislations in
certain countries further complicate
attribution. Using cryptocurrencies
(especially altcoins, such as Monero,
offering anonymity) or services, such
as coin mixers, makes tracing the
origin of attacks more difficult.
Another very important obstacle is the
extreme difficulty of prosecuting crossborder cybercriminals, which nationstate actors inherently protect. The lack
of local legal statutes, regulations or
reliable evidence lessens deterrence
and may even motivate threat actors.
Finally, it should be noted that
attribution is a multidimensional
challenge. Attribution—aside from
forensic evidence—depends on
various types of intelligence, including
forensics evidence; Technical
Intelligence (TECHINT); Human
Intelligence (HUMINT); Signals
Intelligence (SIGINT); Open Source
Intelligence (OSINT); and adversarial
tradecraft (i.e., TTPs), infrastructure
and intent. All dimensions must align
for sound and reliable attribution.

Motives
Motives over time

Motives

For the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, annually, we see
Financial motive underlying breaches between 67% and 86%
of the time and Espionage motive as the driver between 10%
and 26% of the time.

Within the dataset that shows all breaches, for both the
2020 DBIR and 2014-2020 DBIR timeframes, we see
Financial motive as the overwhelming Actor motive (86%
and 76%, respectively), with Espionage the second highest
motive (10% and 18% respectively).

Given their nature (e.g., stealthy tactics, specific targeting),
Espionage attacks can be difficult to detect and identify as
an actual Espionage-related attack (given scant IoCs and
other details).

Actor motives consolidated in “The Rest” (6%) for the
2014-2020 DBIR timeframe include Fun (3%), Grudge (1%),
Convenience (1%) and Ideology (1%).

Whereas Financial attacks—if not detected while occurring or
soon thereafter—eventually become apparent when money
goes missing. At that point, the Financial motive, if not already
ascertained, can be determined.

Proactive defense:
The best defense is a great offense.
Threat hunting |
Behavioral analysis
Advanced threat actors attempt
to blend in to evade automated
cyberdefense measures. With the rise
of zero-day and fileless attacks, it’s
harder than ever to protect endpoints
with confidence. In addition, preventing
and detecting these attacks can be a
huge drain on organizational resources.
Compromise happens within minutes
to hours, as we have seen consistently
over the years in the DBIR. This is mainly
attributable to the use of email and
web-based threat vectors coupled with
heavily automated attacks (nowadays
also powered by machine learning).
Visibility and detection speed
techniques play a very important role
in this never-ending battle against
cyberattacks. It is imperative that
detection measures be a combination
of signature- and behavior-based
techniques. One cannot manage or
defend against unknown threats using
traditional means. Effective, efficient
and multilayered threat hunting can
help give you a significant advantage in
detecting these unknowns.
Threat hunting consists of:
1. Making hypothesis-driven exercises
2. Proactively and reactively searching
for threat actor activities
3. Effectively eliminating, or at least
reducing, false negatives (indicators
that signature-based detection
approaches can overlook)

Additional actions
Consider taking these additional
protective measures:
• Assign all users separate, unique
accounts. Don’t use generic or
shared accounts or passwords
• Block outbound, unrestricted internet
access from server infrastructure.
This is intended to prevent
adversaries from exfiltrating data to
known or unknown IP addresses and
using services, protocols or ports in
an unauthorized manner
• Create adequate network
segmentation to separate virtual local
area networks (VLANs) from internetfacing infrastructure, server farms,
internal networks and administrator
networks. Appropriate segmentation
makes it difficult for an adversary to
move laterally within the network
• Restrict PowerShell and other native
scripting to only individuals with an
acknowledged legitimate use and track
the assignment of such privileges
• Prohibit interactive log-ons using
service accounts or “break-the-glass”
accounts. Implement a rule in the
SIEM to trigger an alert to the security
operations team whenever an attempt
is made to log on to any system
interactively using service accounts
• Require two-factor authentication
for all administrative access to
infrastructure components. This
implementation will mitigate the
impersonation risk and prohibit access
using unauthorized credentials

4. Assuming that threat actors are
already present in the infrastructure
5. Placing a strong focus on indicators
of attack (IoAs) combined with IoCs
6. Prioritizing overall threat types and
looking for the most dangerous
ones first

Tradecraft
NIST CSF Respond
Develop and implement appropriate
activities to take action regarding a
detected cybersecurity incident.
Investigating Cyber-Espionage
breaches differs from researching
cybersecurity incidents. Thus, incident
responders and forensic investigators
may not initially realize that an
attack is targeted and the motive is
intellectual property theft. It’s only as
the investigation progresses and the
complexity of the attack becomes
apparent that investigators take a
slightly different approach.
Before the investigation, investigators
collect technical information such
as network topology. Investigators
also interview network and system
administrators to scope out the incident
and identify possible intrusion channels.
In addition, investigators collect inscope volatile data and system images
plus all associated logs from various
sources, such as system (including
PowerShell or System Monitor), SIEM
and proxy logs.
Understanding how the incident was
detected helps an investigator triage
and scope, as Cyber-Espionage attacks
generally involve multiple systems
and other infrastructure components.
In-scope data sources require periodic
review and re-scoping throughout the
IR lifecycle.

One key objective for a CyberEspionage investigation is to identify
“patient zero” and determine how
the adversary gained access to the
infrastructure. Common methods of
entry include exploiting an internetfacing application, applying brute force
to an account, using phishing email to
gain an initial foothold or compromising
the human factor—trust.
During Cyber-Espionage investigations,
it is common to find phishing (or
targeted phishing) emails as the initial
vector. These emails usually are well
crafted (industry specific) to lure the
recipients either to click a URL hosting
a malicious or lookalike website, or
to open an attachment that executes
malicious software. In some cases,
obtaining user credentials is the goal for
follow-on use in the initial penetration.
Based on the information received
from the impacted organization and
the results of the initial analysis, the
threat-intelligence team endeavors
to identify an associated threat actor.
By identifying its goals, capabilities
and methods, the team can develop
attack models—based on the most
common and most lethal cybersecurity
incidents—to prepare for and better
respond to cybersecurity attacks.
When combined with organization
profiling, unique risk identification is
possible and can provide valuable
assistance to the investigation to find
in-scope compromised or affected
infrastructure components.

Sometimes, the cyber threat
intelligence team encounters stolen
data and credentials being traded by
cybercriminals, and this data is all the
adversary needs for further attacks on
an organization.
One key challenge faced during
Cyber-Espionage investigations is the
identification of compromised systems.
Many Cyber-Espionage attacks are
associated with advanced persistent
attacks—multistaged attacks that
involve lateral movement.
Identifying compromised assets or
assets posing as intermediaries can
be a challenge. Cyber-Espionage
attacks employ specifically created
malware that causes multiple layers
of obfuscation and malware variants,
making IoC-based detection within the
enterprise environment difficult.
A further challenge is that CyberEspionage attacks often leverage
legitimate credentials and legitimate
dual-use tools, such as network
mapping or remote access software
already being used in the environment.
This makes it extremely difficult to
differentiate between malicious actions
and legitimate administrative tasks.
To circumvent challenges, EDR
and NDR solutions help identify
abnormalities and build the IoCs
necessary to locate affected systems
and infrastructure components.

Response tips

26

• Learn how the incident was detected to help
investigators triage the incident and scope
the response

• Search for common vectors, such as phishing (or
targeted phishing) emails that lure recipients to execute
malicious software

• Identify “patient zero” and determine how the
adversary gained access to the organization’s
network infrastructure

• Deploy EDR and NDR solutions to aid
incident response

2020-2021 Cyber-Espionage Report

The sweetener:
Honeypots, honeytokens, honeynets
A honeypot is a system, or several
networked systems, that waits for
unsolicited requests. More specifically,
honeypots observe unsolicited
activity, attract possible threat
actors and document their methods.
Honeypots are effective for discovering
opportunistic attacks, large-scale
probes or computer worms, brute
force authentication, misconfiguration,
vulnerability exploits and web
application attacks.
Information security researchers
use honeypot technologies for
counterespionage attacks because
they can mimic the organization’s
production environment but with fake
believable data as bait.
The purpose of honeypot technology
isn’t only to detect a threat actor, but
to also:
• Slow down the threat actor
• Lure threat actors away from
sensitive data
• Collect information on the threat
actor
• Gain visibility into gaps in
perimeter defenses
Honeypot technology requires the
organization to have fundamental
information security controls already
in place. To reach this higher maturity
level, organizations should:
• Identify crown jewels that the threat
actor would potentially seek
• Enable monitoring, logging,
alerting and response processes in
associated infrastructure
• Integrate information security
infrastructure components

Once the maturity requirements are
fulfilled, the next step is to start small
and scale up gradually. Similar to
building an SIEM infrastructure, it is
best to deploy deception solutions
based on use cases. Start with a highrisk scenario you want to address and
build from there.
The scenario can be based on either risk
analysis or real incidents. When using
real incident scenarios, it is important to
leverage cyber threat intelligence.

You can extend the simple document
and honeytoken approach to a system
honeypot, such as a file server hosting
the document. This allows security
administrators to detect an intrusion
before the adversary reaches the
honeytoken document. Again, the
system must pose as a standard file
server to lure the adversary.
If we extend this concept, we reach the
honeynet level, a network of honeypots.

Start with your top identified CyberEspionage risk. Determine how
the sensitive data is stored (digital
documents, database), where it is
stored (file server, database server, web
application) and what the data looks like.
If sensitive data is stored in documents,
for instance, create realistic documents
with fake data. Then consider using a
honeytoken with a canary value that, if
used, will trigger a security alert.
A honeytoken can be as simple as
an unused official email address, a
link to an unused server, specific
keywords or records. If a honeytoken
is used, it should trigger an alert in
the security-monitoring infrastructure.
Honeytokens can also be extended
to other components such as specific
database records or invalid or unused
user accounts.
Some organizations have gone further
by intentionally using administrative
account names such as “administrator”
or “adm-yinzer” as honeytokens. These
honeytokens can be made to appear
even more enticing by associating
them with critical servers such as
domain controllers using “DC” in the
system name.

• Train employees on
incident response
• Segment the network and be able to
redirect traffic easily, if needed

Deeper dive—Action varieties
For this deeper dive into Action varieties, we filtered the DBIR
dataset for External actors and for Espionage and Financial
motives within breaches.
During the 2014-2020 DBIR timeframe, the top four Action
varieties by External actor with Espionage motive within
breaches are Phishing (81%), Use of backdoor or C2 (60%),
Backdoor (54%) and C2 (53%). Capture stored data (27%)
and Downloader (27%) are tied for a distant fifth.
This high percentage across four Action varieties (which can
be simplified further into Phishing, Backdoor and C2) implies
that these are the primary go-to choices for threat actors with
Espionage motive.

MITRE ATT&CK®
framework aspects
MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally accessible
knowledge base of adversary tactics
and techniques based on real-world
observations. In the 2020 DBIR, we
mapped VERIS (threat actions) to
MITRE ATT&CK.® If your organization
uses MITRE ATT&CK,® here are some
questions to ask:
• How was “initial access” gained? (e.g.,
known vulnerability exploitation, driveby download, phishing attack vector,
compromised credential access)
• How was “persistence” achieved?
(e.g., new accounts, hooking, startup
item, registry run keys, batch jobs,
scheduled tasks)

• How did the adversary escalate
privileges? (e.g., account bypass,
Dynamic Link Library hijacking,
vulnerability exploitation,
process injection)
• Were there any indications of lateral
movement? (e.g., remote service
exploitation, local admin account
log-ons, pass the hash vs. pass the
ticket, network sniffing)
• How did C2 servers access the
environment? (e.g., unknown or
unexpected traffic or http, https, ftp,
etc.; data encoding or obfuscation;
domain fronting; uncommon ports)

EDR and NDR technologies
Using an EDR solution during a
Cyber-Espionage investigation can
significantly increase the effectiveness
of the investigation. This technology
can provide much needed visibility
into understanding adversary
TTPs, monitoring lateral movement,
identifying persistence mechanisms
and expediting the return to normal
business operations.
EDR technology can accelerate the
speed of the investigation by utilizing
behavioral detection tactics combined
with IoC-based searches (in near real
time) within the infrastructure, leading
to further identification of compromised
or affected system components.

NDR deployments give investigators
access to large amounts of data, which
they can index for rapid searches to
identify anomalies. This can lead to the
discovery of other unidentified, infected
infrastructure components and help
build up the IoCs needed to find more
impacted and compromised systems.
EDR and NDR solutions can be efficient
toolsets for organizations to leverage
during an incident and hasten the return
to normal business operation.

Network traffic can provide keen insight
into threat actors’ breach defenses and
impact assets and data. Utilizing NDR
solutions gives organizations in-depth
visibility into the network, which helps
network forensics investigators gain
insights into packet-level activities.
Such insight helps investigators identify
new IoCs using behavioral analysis and
heuristics techniques.

The way forward
NIST CSF Recover
Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain
plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services
that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.
After-action reviews (a.k.a. postmortem sessions) should
be completed as part of any IR effort. This is particularly
important for the closeout of more advanced IR efforts, such
as those focused on Cyber-Espionage attacks.
Complete the review by conducting a lessons-learned
discussion, noting participant feedback (e.g., what went well,
what went not so well and what can be improved upon in the
next session).

Assemble feedback and countermeasure solutions in an action
plan to update the IR Plan, determine additional IR resource
requirements and identify internal IR stakeholder and tactical
responder training needs. Ensure that an organization’s IR
lifecycle includes an explicit provision directing continual
maturation via the after action-review process.

Recovery tips
• Complete a postmortem review of any IR actions
• Develop a post-incident action plan to incorporate
lessons learned
• Ensure that the after action-review process becomes
part of the organization’s maturation process

Appendix A: Guides
VERIS framework
Overview

Threat actors

Vocabulary for Event Recording
and Incident Sharing (VERIS) is a
set of metrics designed to provide
a common language for describing
security incidents in a structured and
repeatable manner.

Entities causing or contributing to an
incident are referred to as threat actors.

VERIS was crafted as a response to
one of the most critical and persistent
challenges in the security industry—a
lack of quality information.
VERIS targets this problem by helping
organizations to collect useful incidentrelated information and to share
it—anonymously and responsibly—
with others. The overall goal is to
lay a foundation from which we can
constructively and cooperatively learn
from our experiences to better measure
and manage risk.

A4 threat model
VERIS employs the A4 threat model,
which was developed originally by the
Verizon RISK Team (now known as
VTRAC). In the A4 threat model, an
incident is viewed as a series of events
that adversely affect the information
assets of an organization. The A4
threat model elements are:
• Actors: Whose actions affected
the asset?
• Actions: What actions affected
the asset?
• Assets: Which assets were affected?
• Attributes: How were assets affected?

40

Hacking: Attempting to intentionally
access or harm information assets,
without (or exceeding) authorization,
by circumventing or thwarting logical
security mechanisms

External actors: External threats
originate from sources outside of
the organization and its network of
partners. Typically, no trust or privilege
is implied for external entities.

Malware: Any malicious software, script
or code that runs on a device to alter
its state or function without the owner’s
informed consent

Internal actors: Internal threats
originate from within the organization.
Insiders are trusted and privileged
(some more than others).

Assets and attributes

Partner actors: Partners include any
third party that shares a business
relationship with the organization. Some
level of trust and privilege is usually
implied between business partners and
the organizations.

A compromised asset is one that
suffers from any loss of confidentiality/
possession, integrity/authenticity or
availability/utility (primary security
attributes of the expanded CIA Triad). An
incident can involve multiple assets and
affect multiple attributes (each of which
contains different metrics) of those assets.

Threat actions

Additional resources

Threat actors conduct threat actions
to cause or contribute to an incident.
VERIS uses seven primary categories
for threat actions: Malware, Hacking,
Social, Misuse, Physical, Error and
Environmental. For this report, we
focus on four: Misuse, Social, Hacking
and Malware.

Further information on VERIS can be
obtained from these resources:

Misuse: Using entrusted organizational
resources or privileges for any
purpose or manner contrary to that
which was intended

Preparation

Overview
Based in our previous proactive IR
engagements, we’ve formulated a
six-phase approach to investigative
response and IR readiness: the
Verizon Incident Preparedness and
Response (VIPR) process. VIPR
consists of six phases: (1) Planning
and Preparation, (2) Detection and
Validation, (3) Containment and
Eradication, (4) Collection and Analysis,
(5) Remediation and Recovery, and (6)
Assessment and Adjustment.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Overview

Five functions

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is voluntary
guidance based on existing standards, guidelines and
practices to help organizations better manage and reduce
cybersecurity risk. In addition to helping organizations
manage and reduce risks, it was designed to foster risk and
cybersecurity management communications among both
internal and external organizational stakeholders.

The five functions of the NIST CSF are as follows:

nist.gov/cyberframework

Identify. Develop an organizational understanding to
manage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data
and capabilities.
Examples of outcome categories include Asset Management,
Business Environment, Governance, Risk Assessment and
Risk Management Strategy.

Detect

Examples of outcome categories include Identity Management
and Access Control, Awareness and Training, Data
Security, Information Protection Processes and Procedures,
Maintenance, and Protective Technology.
Detect. Develop and implement appropriate activities to
identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
Examples of outcome categories include Anomalies and Events,
Security, Continuous Monitoring, and Detection Processes.
Respond. Develop and implement appropriate activities to
take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
Examples of outcome categories include Response Planning,
Communications, Analysis, Mitigation and Improvements.

Figure #58: NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST CSF provides a common language for understanding,
managing and expressing cybersecurity risk to internal and
external stakeholders. It can be used to help identify and
prioritize actions for reducing cybersecurity risk, and it is a tool
for aligning policy, business and technological approaches to
managing that risk. It can be used to manage cybersecurity risk
across entire organizations or it can be focused on the delivery
of critical services within an organization:

Recover. Develop and implement appropriate activities to
maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or
services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.
Examples of outcome categories include Recovery Planning,
Improvements and Communications.

Organizations with varying resources and risk exposure use
the CIS CSCs to build an effective cyber-defense program:
cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/

DBIR Implementation
The 2020 DBIR best describes the implementation of
CIS CSCs:
For those who are unacquainted with the CIS CSCs, they
are a community-built, attacker-informed prioritized set
of cybersecurity guidelines that consist of 171 safeguards
organized into 20 higher-level controls.

Foundational

One of the unique elements of the CIS CSCs is their focus on
helping organizations understand where to start their security
program. This prioritization is represented in two ways:
• Through the ordering of the CSCs so that they allow a loose
prioritization (CSC-1: Inventory of Hardware is probably a
better place to start than CSC-20: Penetration Testing)
• Introduced in version 7.150 is the concept of Implementation
Groups, in which the 171 safeguards are grouped, based on
the resources and risks the organizations are facing. This
means that a smaller organization with fewer resources
(Implementation Group 1) shouldn’t be expected to
implement resource and process-intensive controls such as
Passive Asset Discovery even if it’s within CSC-1, while an
organization with more resources and/or a higher risk level
may want to consider that control

Summary
Since 2014, confirmed data breaches with Espionage
motive made up about 8% of the breaches reported in the
Educational Services industry. In 2019, the percentage
was only 1%. While the percentage is low, this percentage
is somewhat driven down due to the very high rate of
Ransomware (80%) financially motivated breaches that
target this industry.
Another consideration when looking at the numbers for the
Educational Industry is that Cyber-Espionage threat actors
are known to use ransomware to cover up data theft, and in
many cases the threat actor succeeds in preventing analysts
from determining what if any data was exfiltrated from the
network. This is particularly true when the organization
doesn’t have sufficient logging in place to properly investigate.

Summary
The DBIR dataset pertaining to Cyber-Espionage in the
Financial and Insurance industry has seen some significant
changes in percentages. For the past seven years
(2014-2020 DBIR timeframe), Financial on average was
approximately 3%; however in the last three years, it made up
6.3% of Cyber-Espionage breaches. In 2018, there was
a significant increase where it reached 10.3%.
Remember, these numbers represent only reported breaches.
When the compromised data doesn’t fall within reporting
criteria, a private organization may choose not to disclose
a breach. This makes Cyber-Espionage breaches, which
are already challenging to detect, even less likely to be
discovered and by extension, reported. There is no way to
truly gauge the magnitude of Cyber-Espionage attacks,
especially in any of the private industries.

Summary
The Information industry reported the fourth-highest amount
of Cyber-Espionage-motivated data breaches during the
2014-2020 DBIR timeframe. Information is a vast industry,
which encompasses all organizations involved in the creation,
storage or transmission of information.
The bread-and-butter motivation for Information industry
data breaches is Financial; however, we have still seen 7% of
breaches with a Cyber-Espionage motive.
An important factor for breaches in the Information industry
is that since 2019, there has been a significant increase in
web applications attacks, which are leveraging both stolen
credentials and vulnerability exploitation. Misconfiguration
errors were a main contributing factor to breaches in the
Information industry.

Summary
In 2019, the Manufacturing industry had the largest number
of Cyber-Espionage-motivated breaches compared to other
industries. Overall between 2014 and 2020, it’s ranked as
the second-highest-hit industry at nearly 22% of all reported
Cyber-Espionage breaches.
In 2018, we noted a significant drop in reported CyberEspionage breaches in the Manufacturing industry. However,
we believe this was due in part to a change that year in DBIR
contributors who typically provide specific metrics around
Cyber-Espionage breaches in Manufacturing.
Cyber-Espionage threat actors primarily target Secrets and—
like all other industries—Credentials as a means to acquire
these Secrets.

Figure #100: Breaches by pattern for Mining + Utilities
(2014-2020 DBIR; n=230)

Summary
In 2019, less than half of breaches in the Mining, Quarrying,
Oil & Gas Extraction + Utilities industries had confirmed
motives, resulting in significant ranges for Financial and
Espionage motive percentages.
For this industry combination, we observed a range of
8%-43% in Espionage motives, making the degree of this
threat uncertain. The range also highlights the challenges in
identifying Espionage-motivated attacks and determining just
how prevalent the threat is in this industry.
We see the dominant action for Cyber-Espionage breaches
in this industry as Social followed closely by Malware
and Hacking.

breaches between 2014 and 2019. Like other private
industries, not all Cyber-Espionage breaches are reported.
Since 2015, we have seen a definite decline in reported
Espionage-motivated attacks in the Professional industry.
We cannot account for the number of unreported breaches.
From the reported breaches, however, we can see that
assets Person and User Dev were the top compromised
assets and that 80% of compromised data was classified
as Secrets.

Summary
The Public Administration industry has ranked in the past
several years as one of the top industries reporting confirmed
data breaches with a Cyber-Espionage motive. In fact, in the
past three years, nearly half of Cyber-Espionage breaches
were reported in the public sector. And, since 2014, nearly a
quarter of the Cyber-Espionage breaches were reported in
this industry.

There are a few factors to consider when looking at these
numbers. We know that government data is one of the top
data types of interest to Nation-state and State-affiliated
actors, so these numbers don’t surprise us. However, it is
important to point out that the public industry has more
stringent reporting requirements than the private sector,
which will inevitably result in more breaches being reported.

About VTRAC
The Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC)
has been assisting customers globally with maturing and
improving their IR readiness for more than 14 years. In
conducting its engagements, VTRAC uses industry best
practices—such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework—and
our VIPR phases, as well as our expertise from the more than
500 incidents we investigate globally each year. We cover all
five functional areas of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Our capabilities include endpoint forensics, network forensics,
malware reverse engineering, threat intelligence, threat hunting,
dark web research, mobile device forensics and complex data
recovery, as well as breach simulations, cyber threat landscape
briefings, IR capability assessments, first responder training,
and IR Plan and playbook development.

About the cover
Cyber-Espionage breaches occur when external attackers,
such as State-affiliated or Nation-state threat actors,
penetrate victim organization cyberdefenses to steal sensitive
data or proprietary information. The cover image for our firstever Cyber-Espionage Report depicts a Cyber-Espionage
breach at the moment the attacker pierces the veil of security
en route to plundering their targeted victim’s critical assets
and most sensitive information.
