Talos recently published a technical analysis of a backdoor which was included with version 5.33

of the CCleaner application. During ourTeslacrypt
investigation
we were
provided an archive containing les

that were stored on the C2 server. Initially, we had concerns about the legitimacy of the les.

However, we were able to quickly verify that the les were very likely genuine based upon the web

server con guration les and the fact that our research activity was re ected in the contents of

the MySQL database included in the archived les.

In analyzing the delivery code from the C2 server, what immediately stands out is a list of

organizations, including Cisco, that were
speci cally targeted through delivery of a second-stage

loader. Based on a review of the C2 tracking database, which only covers four days in September,

we can con rm that at least 20 victim machines were served specialized secondary payloads.

The contents of the web directory taken from the C2 server included a series of PHP les

responsible for controlling communications with infected systems. The attacker used a symlink
to redirect all normal tra c requesting 'index.php' to the 'x.php' le, which contains the malicious
PHP script.

In analyzing the contents of the PHP les, we identi ed that the server implemented a series of
checks to determine whether to proceed with standard operations or simply redirect to the
legitimate Piriform web site. The contents of the HTTP Host header, the request method type,
and the server port are checked to con rm that they match what is expected from beacons sent

There is also functionality responsible for loading and executing the Stage 2 payload on systems
that meet the prede ned requirements, similar to functionality that we identi ed would be
required in our previous analysis of Stage 1. While there is shellcode associated with both x86
and x64 PE delivery, it appears that only the x86 PE loading functionality is actually utilized by the
C2 server.

The use of domain-based ltering further indicates the targeted nature of this attack. While we

have con rmed that the number of systems
affected
by the
backdoor was large based upon
Cisco Smart
Install
Scanner

beacon information stored within the MySQL database, the attackers were speci cally controlling
which infected systems were actually delivered
a Stage 2 payload. While it was reported that no
ROPMEMU
systems executed a Stage 2 payload, this is not accurate. In analyzing the database table storing
information on the systems that were delivered a Stage 2 payload, we identi ed 20 unique hosts
that may have been affected by this payload. The functionality present within Stage 2 is
documented in the "Stage 2 Payloads" section of this post.

MySQL Database
The C2 MySQL database held two tables: one describing all machines that had reported to the
server and one describing all machines that received the second-stage download, both of which
had entries were dated between Sept. 12th and Sept. 16th. Over 700,000 machines reported to
the C2 server over this time period, and more than 20 machines have received the second-stage
payload. It is important to understand that the target list can be and was changed over the period
the server was active to target different organizations.

During the compromise, the malware would periodically contact the C2 server and transmit
reconnaissance information about infected systems. This information included IP addresses,
online time, hostname, domain name, process listings, and more. It's quite likely this information
was used by the attackers to determine which machines they should target during the nal

Based on analysis of the 'Server' database table, it is obvious this infrastructure provides
attackers access to a variety of different targets. Given the ltering in place on the C2 server, the
attackers could add or remove domains at any given time, based upon the environments or
organizations they choose to target. To provide additional perspective regarding the types of
systems that the attackers could choose to further compromise, the screenshot below shows the

This demonstrates the level of access that was made available to the attackers through the use

of this infrastructure and associated malware and further highlights the severityand potential
impact of this attack.

Stage 2 Payloads
The stage 2 installer is GeeSetup_x86.dll. This installer checks the OS version and then drops
either a 32-bit or 64-bit version of a trojanized tool. The x86 version is using a trojanized
TSMSISrv.dll, which drops VirtCDRDrv (which matches the lename of a legitimate executable
that is part of Corel) using a similar method to the backdoored CCleaner tool. The x64 version
drops a trojanized EFACli64.dll le named SymEFA which is the lename taken from a legitimate
executable that is part of "Symantec Endpoint". None of the les that are dropped are signed or
legitimate.

Effectively, they patch a legitimate binary to package their malware. Additionally, the setup put an
encoded PE in the registry :
