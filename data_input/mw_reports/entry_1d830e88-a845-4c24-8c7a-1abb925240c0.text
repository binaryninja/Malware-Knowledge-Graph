New remote memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer browsers allows for
full takeover of infected systems
Bitdefender has confirmed exploitation in the wild of CVE-2020-0674 with analysis of 2
distinct executable payloads
Hypervisor Introspection delivers true zero-day protection by preventing all common
memory exploit techniques
On January 17, Microsoft announced Security Advisory ADV200001, describing a zero-day
remote code execution in Internet Explorer that has been actively exploited in the wild. This
announcement continues the parade of devastating memory-space exploits including
EternalBlue and BlueKeep.

Vulnerability
CVE-2020-0674 is a recently discovered browser vulnerability in the Microsoft scripting
engine that allows for remote code execution (RCE) on Internet Explorer browsers from
malicious JavaScript (.js) files. The exploit carries Microsoft’s highest severity rating of

1/4

Critical and it affects Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, and 11.
Microsoft, DHS Warn of Zero-Day Attack Targeting IE Users
Bitdefender has confirmed that this critical vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.
Security researchers in Bitdefender Labs have obtained and analyzed multiple samples to
explore its tactics, techniques, and procedures. We have independently verified that 2
distinct executable payloads are unleashed by the exploit and currently in circulation:

Below are Bitdefender’s analysis and key findings concerning the exploitation of CVE-20200674 in the wild. We also demonstrate the successful detection and defeat of this dangerous
exploit in virtual datacenter systems protected by Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection (HVI)
—including standard desktops, servers, and VDI desktops. HVI prevents this type of exploit,
closing the gap between the time exploit code is used in the wild and the time the systems
are patched.

Hypervisor Introspection intercepts and denies the attempt to access and overwrite protected
memory areas.

2/4

Instead of scanning millions of malware samples, Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection
detects all known memory attack techniques—few in number and only visible at the
hypervisor level—identifying advanced and zero-day attacks as easily as any known exploit,
preventing the malicious behavior from executing. HVI requires no signature updates, since
the common attack techniques remain relatively constant, even as the tools and procedures
change with each specific attack. Bitdefender Labs maintains constant vigilance, keeping
pace with new techniques and adding them to HVI’s detection stack.

Breaches
Key Findings
1. Malicious URLs from phishing links contain multiple JavaScripts, each operating on a
different version of Windows to exploit CVE-2020-0674
1. When the RCE memory-space exploit is successful, the scripts download and run two
distinct executable files in memory with the privileges of the logged-in user
1. The attack attempts to access a protected memory area, to write data to read-only
memory, and to execute arbitrary code from a non-executable area such the heap
stack or process stack

Impact of Virtualization Security on Your VDI Environment White Paper
Conclusions
3/4

Hypervisor Introspection is essential in the virtual datacenter, where built-in protection
against new memory exploits and other advanced attacks using well-known exploit
techniques cannot come at the expense of VM efficiency, density, or performance. Don’t rely
on vendor software patches to keep you safe, as the attackers will always be one step
ahead. Instead, proactively take away their operating space with HVI and set your defenses
on the high ground of memory space. Bitdefender has demonstrated proactive prevention of
memory vulnerabilities and exploits time and again—from EternalBlue to BlueKeep and more
—proving that proactive defense with denial is always better than reactive detection.
