Trend Micro researchers discovered a new ransomware that abuses the APIs of a legitimate tool called Everything, a Windows filename
search engine developed by Voidtools that offers quick searching and real-time updates for minimal resource usage. This ransomware (which
we named Mimic based on a string we found in its binaries), was first observed in the wild in June 2022 and targets Russian and Englishspeaking users. It is equipped with multiple capabilities such as deleting shadow copies, terminating multiple applications and services, and
abusing Everything32.dll functions to query target files that are to be encrypted.
In this blog entry, we will take a closer look at the Mimic ransomware, its components and functions, and its connection to the Conti builder that
was leaked in early 2022.
Arrival and components
Mimic arrives as an executable that drops multiple binaries and a password-protected archive (disguised as Everything64.dll) which when
extracted, contains the ransomware payload. It also includes tools that are used for turning off Windows defender and legitimate sdel binaries.

When executed, it will first drop its components to the %Temp%/7zipSfx folder. It will then extract the password protected Everything64.dll to
the same directory using the dropped 7za.exe via the following command:
%Temp%\7ZipSfx.000\7za.exe" x -y -p20475326413135730160 Everything64.dll

It will also drop the session key file session.tmp to the same directory, which will be used for continuing the encryption in case the process is
interrupted.

Figure 3. The content of session.tmp
It will then copy the dropped files to “%LocalAppData%\{Random GUID}\”, after which the ransomware will be renamed to bestplacetolive.exe
and the original files deleted from the %Temp% directory.
Based on our analysis, Mimic supports other command line arguments as shown in table 2.

Mimic ransomware analysis
Mimic ransomware consists of multiple threads that employ the CreateThread function for faster encryption and render analysis more
challenging for security researchers.
When executed, it will first register a hotkey (Ctrl + F1, using the RegisterHotKey API) that displays the status logs being performed by the
ransomware.

Mimic ransomware possesses a plethora of capabilities, including the following:
Collecting system information
Creating persistence via the RUN key
Bypassing User Account Control (UAC)
Disabling Windows Defender
Disabling Windows telemetry
Activating anti-shutdown measures
Activating anti-kill measures
Unmounting Virtual Drives
Terminating processes and services
Disabling sleep mode and shutdown of the system
Removing indicators
Inhibiting System Recovery

Abusing Everything32 APIs for encryption
Mimic uses Everything32.dll, a legitimate Windows filename search engine that can return real time results for queries, in its routine. It abuses
the tool by querying certain file extensions and filenames using Everything’s APIs to retrieve the file’s path for encryption.

Figure 9. Overview of the function

that utilizes Everything API
It uses the Everything_SetSearchW function to search for files to be encrypted or avoided using the following search format:
file:<ext:{list of extension}>file:<!endwith:{list of files/directory to avoid}>wholefilename<!{list of files to avoid}>
The following query is used by Mimic to search for files to be encrypted or avoided:
file:
<ext:;sql;sqlite;sqlite3;sqlitedb;mdf;mdb;adb;db;db3;dbf;dbs;udb;dbv;dbx;edb;exb;1cd;fdb;idb;mpd;myd;odb;xls;xlsx;doc;docx;bac;bak;back;zip;rar

Code from leaked Conti builder
From our analysis, some parts of the code seemed to be based on, and share several similarities with the Conti ransomware builder that was
leaked in March 2022. For example, the enumeration of the encryption modes shares the same integer for both Mimic and Conti.

Figure 13. Similarities between Mimic (top) and the leaked Conti builder (bottom)

The code related to argument net is also based on Conti. It will use the GetIpNetTable function to read the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
cache and check if IP addresses contain “172.”, “192.168”, “10.”, or “169.” Mimic added a filter to exclude IP addresses that contain “169.254”,
which is the IP range of Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).

Mimic also uses the Conti code in Windows Share Enumeration, where it employs the NetShareEnum function to enumerate all shares on the
gathered IP addresses.

Finally, Mimic’s port scanning is also based on the Conti builder.

Conclusion
Mimic ransomware, with its multiple bundled capabilities, seems to implement a new approach to speeding up its routine by combining multiple
running threads and abusing Everything’s APIs for its encryption (minimizing resource usage, therefore resulting in more efficient execution).
Furthermore, the threat actor behind Mimic seems to be resourceful and technically adept, using a leaked ransomware builder to capitalize on
its various features, and even improve on it for more effective attacks.
To protect systems from ransomware attacks, we recommend that both individual users and organizations implement best practices such as
applying data protection, backup, and recovery measures to secure data from possible encryption or erasure. Conducting regular vulnerability
assessments and patching systems in a timely manner can also minimize the damage dealt by ransomware that abuse exploits.
A multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network). The right
security solutions can also detect malicious components and suspicious behavior to protect enterprises.
