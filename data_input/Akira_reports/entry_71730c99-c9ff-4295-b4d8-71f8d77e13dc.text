Conclusion

for Raimund Genes (1963-2017)

Web attacks—attacks that compromise internet assets like mail servers,
cloud infrastructures, and websites—are troubling phenomena. The research
community has put considerable effort into investigating these incidents but
has mostly focused on detecting attacks and not delving into the reasons
behind these attacks.
Of course, the typical cybercriminal's goal is to profit. They might compromise
websites to push ransomware, or they could try and steal data—recent breaches
show that information is an increasingly valuable commodity. But, as this paper
discusses, more emotional motivations, such as patriotism, specific real-world
events or simply hacktivism, can also trigger compromises.
Web defacement hacktivism is the practice of subverting a website with the
goal of promoting a specific agenda or political ideology. Methods may vary,
but when hacktivists compromise a website, the usual tactic involves replacing
the original page with their version—a practice that is called web defacement.
Hacktivism is mainly linked to web defacement, but a hacktivist (the attacker)
can also be involved in traffic redirection (from a legitimate site to an attackerowned site), denial of service (a form of service disruption), and malware
distribution to support their particular cause.
Dedicated websites like Zone-H1 collect evidence of web defacements and
defacers can voluntarily advertise their compromise by submitting a report.
Elaborating on the reasons behind web defacements at scale is not as easy as
it seems. While someone could theorize that geopolitical events and conflicts
influence cybercriminals’ attacks against websites and their choice of victims,
corroborating this phenomenon requires large-scale analysis.

Our examination of over 13 million web defacement reports against websites
spans over 18 years, covering multiple continents. We designed an internal
system that gathers, analyzes, and clusters these millions of reports. As we
identify the major campaigns of these defacers, we can provide further insights
into how geopolitical events are reflected in web defacements. We also look at
how different factors, such as the political beliefs and the decafers' religious
inclination, can trigger and affect these attacks.
Our first two sections provide high-level insights into our dataset of defacements,
as well as some defining facts about the targets and tactics used by the defacers.
Our next section on Real World Impact breaks down seven top campaigns that
have affected Israel, France, India, Syria, Kosovo, and countries surrounding
the South China Sea. We delve into specific conflicts in those areas and the
defacements that happened in the aftermath.
The succeeding sections cover the hacking groups' affiliations and how their
collectives are organized—some collectives are formed across continents, and
some are a loose collection of local hackers. Recruitment tools and the methods
used to distribute hacking techniques are also discussed.
The final sections discuss other activities that defacers take part in, and
how the current activities may evolve. Recently, there have been incidents of
hackers who have gone from simple web defacement to activities supporting
cybercrime. There is a real possibility that defacers and defacement groups will
start to escalate their activities, move away from ideological motivations, and
turn into cybercrime.

Our Approach to the
Investigation
Our objectives include exploring motivations and influences behind website defacements, focusing
on how geopolitical events act as triggers for web defacement activities. To better understand these
dynamics globally, we gathered web defacement reports from third-party sources and processed them
with an automated system we designed specifically for this purpose.
Each web defacement report consists of:
1. Meta-information on the defacement, such as timestamp, website URL, the defacer's name,
vulnerability, and more.
2. The deface page planted by the defacer (or modified, if this is the case). The deface page comes in
the form of a source code (HTML/JS/CCS) and may contain small-sized external resources such as
images. Additional content is fetched dynamically at analysis-time.
Our system automatically analyzes each deface page via two components:
1. A static-code analyzer that extracts representative features (i.e., characteristics) from the page (like
title, length, and encoding) in an offline manner.
2. A dynamic-code analyzer that renders the page with a headless browser and extracts additional
features in an online fashion. This analyzer works better with dynamically generated pages (e.g., when
a link is generated via JavaScript) or pages with external content like embedded streams of songs.
The output of these components is a set of features that describe the page at high-level. These features
are used as input for the following component: the campaign detector.
The campaign detector looks for defacements that—we believe—are conducted by the same actor
or criminal group. This is often the case with campaigns wherein multiple actors unite and conduct
defacements that relate to each other, such as those with similar target choices or deface pages. In
fact, defacers enlisted on the same campaign are usually provided with a template for rendering similar

5 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

deface pages. These templates provide consistency in promoting the criminal group and spreading the
campaign's propaganda and motivations.
This component groups similar pages accordingly, and represents them in form of clusters of web
defacement campaigns. For this process, we make use of machine learning. We apply unsupervised
learning to a set of features that well represents a summary of the pages — these are received from the
static and dynamic analyzers mentioned before. The process automatically detects new campaigns and
labels them for inspection. The result of this processing is indexed in an elastic-search back end and
visualized via a web console. For each campaign, the console allows the analyst to inspect information
like the lifespan of the campaign, the composition of the deface pages, as well as that of their actors. The
console also allows analysis on how criminal groups are organized and if/when a certain actor belongs
to multiple groups or moves from one to another. We will discuss the details of our system in a follow-up
paper that will be released later in the year.

9 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

The Role of Social Media
We observed that defacers voluntarily leave contact information upon compromise, based on the features
(i.e., characteristics) automatically extracted during the analysis of the deface pages. It seems to be
common practice for attackers that push propaganda to advertise their beliefs and refer their “viewers” to
social networking sites or provide contact emails of the group.
Overall, we found that emails and Twitter are the primary forms of advertisement, with 25% (email) and
8% (Twitter) of pages displaying at least one of these. In fact, 6% of pages have multiple contact emails.
In contrast, the telephone seems to be an unloved form of contact—only 3% of our attack records have
telephone information. Not a surprising percentage since it may expose the defacer to attribution.
Another interesting aspect of propaganda-driven attacks on websites is the addition of streaming—songs
played in the background of the page or even visual aspects. Our data found that 32% of the defacements
have an embedded URL referencing either a streaming provider (like YouTube) or an audio file hosted on
an external resource that is most likely another compromised machine. We manually investigated some
of these cases and confirmed that most of these songs are related to religion.

Real-World Conflicts
Reflected in Cyberspace
Mass attacks, or attacks that typically use automated hacking tools to compromise as many websites
as possible indiscriminately, are common across the web. But in the course of our research, we noted
a more coordinated form of attack that we labeled “campaigns”. In a campaign, the attackers launch
specific attacks as a reaction to certain events, to push an agenda, make known their grievances, or
spread political messages.
Our system allowed us to identify the top seven campaigns connected to and motivated by real-world
conflicts. In the graph below, the horizontal (X) axis pertains to the number of attackers participating in
a particular campaign, while the vertical (Y) axis maps the number of hacktivism-related defacements
on record. The data shows that the #OpIsrael campaign garnered the most number of attackers, while
Free Kashmir has the most number of defacements. We will delve deeper into these campaigns in the
succeeding sections.

Conflicts Spark Anti-Israel Defacement Campaigns
So far, we've identified three major anti-Israel web defacement campaigns. The first (and the longest)
is #OpIsrael, which is composed of several campaigns supported by different groups. Then there is the
#OpSaveGaza campaign, which is a short, but highly effective defacement campaign in reaction to Israel's
Operation Protective Edge. Last is #OpBader / #ElectronicBader / #BaderOperation, a loosely organized
campaign with multiple groups participating that has gained traction since May 2016.

The struggle between Israel and Palestine is one of the longest modern-day conflicts, starting in 1948 and
continuing to this day7. Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank and military operations in Gaza
only serve as fuel to the anger of Palestinians and other groups sympathetic to Palestine.

These defacements are not random. As much as possible, the hacking groups target Israeli websites, as
co.il and org.il top-level domains (TLDs) rank second and sixth respectively in the distribution of defaced
websites carrying anti-Israel messages.

Figure 7. Target sites for #OpIsrael

#OpIsrael
The very first #OpIsrael web defacement was made by "imLulzPirate" on August 26, 2012. The website
myisrael.us fell victim to the defacement, with the main page of the website altered to display a politically
charged message against Israel and Zionism. The defacement embeds a YouTube video uploaded by
Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, condemning the Gaza War in December 2007 –
January 2008.

13 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 8. The first #OpIsrael defacement made by imLulzPirate

#OpIsrael did not gain any traction after the initial defacement made by imLulzPirate. It took several
months for members of the Anonymous collective to support the cause and organize a campaign against
Israeli websites.
The first organized large-scale defacement campaign happened on April 7, 2013, a date chosen because
it coincides with Holocaust Remembrance Day. This attack has been repeated every year since then, with
326 defacers executing 11,000 plus defacements on more than 5,400 domains.

#OpIsrael Sub-campaigns
#OpIsrael Engaged is a sub-campaign that started in 2015 and continued up to 2016. Similar to the main
#OpIsrael campaign, it peaked every April 7. The AnonGhost team, a tight-knit group that claims to have
members from Mauritania, Morocco, Malaysia, Indonesia, Tunisia, USA, and Ireland, mostly did the 2015
campaign. Anonymous Arabe, a loose group of hackers from Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle
East and North Africa, was responsible for the majority of the 2016 campaign.

14 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 9. Defaced pages by AnonGhost Team and Anonymous Arabe showing identical wording for the
#OpIsrael Engaged campaign

It is worth noting that AnonGhost seems to have either branched out to other countries or has subgroups, with AnonGhost being the umbrella group. So far we've seen AnonGhostDz, which is the Algerian
sub-group, AnonGhost Indonesia, AnongGhost Gaza, AnonGhost Tunisia, AnonGhost Maldives, and
AnonGhost Vietnamese.
#OpIsrael Decided is another sub-campaign that started around the same time as #OpIsrael Engaged,
and uses a similar message. It is supported mostly by an AnonCoders team that is a loose association
of hackers from Albania, Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and France, among others.

15 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 10. #OpIsrael Decided defacement pages shows similar wording to #OpIsrael Engaged

#OpBader / #ElectronicBader / #BaderOperation
This is a larger campaign with 2,759 defacement records, which is as many as the #OpIsrael Engaged
and #OpIsrael Decided sub-campaigns combined. While #OpIsrael Engaged and #OpIsrael Decided had
standard templates (and the participating hackers did not do much to alter these templates), #OpBader is
loosely organized, with templates and messages that vary quite significantly.
The only common identifiable string we can find related to this campaign is the use of these hashtags:
#opisrael #alfallagaTeam #fallaga #fallagateam #tunisianfallagateam #opbader #electronicBader
#baderoperation #hackers #fallagahackers
"Bader" is a reference to the Battle of Badr, a significant battle won by the Prophet Muhammad in the early
years of Islam8. These historical references strongly indicate that these hacking groups view themselves
as cyber-jihadists, viewing their actions as part of a digital jihad.

#OpSaveGaza
The #OpSaveGaza/#SaveGaza campaign is related to #OpIsrael since both target Israel and Israeli actions
in Palestinian territories, but #OpSaveGaza/#SaveGaza is mostly influenced by events in the Gaza region
specifically.
On July 2014, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge, which included airstrikes and a land invasion aimed
at destroying tunnels from Gaza to Israel9. Not surprisingly, the first instance of #OpSaveGaza/#SaveGaza
appeared in response to the land invasion. The defacements continued until October, and only when
hostilities in the Gaza strip subsided significantly did the 2014 campaign die down. #OpSaveGaza had
3,415 defacements within that short period, making it one of the most active web defacement campaigns.

16 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 11. Sample defacement pages of the #OpSaveGaza campaign

#Save Gaza
#Save Gaza started in July of 2016 as a sub-campaign under #opBader, primarily driven by Anonymous
Ghost Gaza. Among the sub-campaigns discussed, it has been the most vocal and the most forceful.
While #OpIsrael Decided and #OpIsrael Engaged use relatively tame language, #Save Gaza incites
violence and puts direct pressure on Israelis, threatening to steal credit card information, bank credentials,
and other website credentials.

17 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 12. Forceful language in the defacement campaign #Save Gaza

It is worth noting that Anonymous Ghost Gaza followed through on their threat to steal the personal
information of Israeli citizens. Members of Anonymous Ghost Gaza posted Israeli citizens' credit card
information and online account credentials on their Facebook page and Pastebin.

Groups behind the Campaigns
Hackers and hacking groups participating in #OpIsrael campaigns are mostly from Arabic-speaking
countries in the Middle East and North Africa, with other groups from Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia
also participating. Note that these are countries that do not recognize the validity of Israel as a state.

The common use of the name "fallaga" by hackers and hacking groups in North Africa is a reference to
"felaghas" or "fellagha", armed groups that were instrumental in driving out the French from Algeria in the
Algerian War that lasted from the 1950s to early 1960s.

Charlie Hebdo Aftermath Results in #OpFrance
On January 7, 2015, two men attacked Charlie Hebdo, a French magazine that caused controversy
several times in the past through its satirical cartoons about Islam and the prophet Muhammad. The
attack left 12 people dead and 11 injured10. In the aftermath, France was a target of other attacks, this
time in cyberspace. The smaller campaigns under #OpFrance include #OpCharlie, #OPCHARLIEHEBDO,
and #AntiCharlieHebdo.

Figure 16. Target sites for #OpFrance

This campaign focused on French websites, with defacers targeting sites of companies like the French
supermarket Carrefour, or sites with .fr TLDs. From our data, 36% of #OpFrance defacements have .fr
TLDs.

Figure 17. Defacement pages for the #OpFrance campaign

Hacking groups from Muslim-majority countries such as Tunisia, Syria, Mauritania, Morocco, Bangladesh
and Indonesia began targeting French websites in an #OpFrance web defacement campaign that appear
to be in support of the attacks. Some of the defacements even paraphrased Saudi-Australian Islamic
preacher Junaid Thorne's statement on the matter, “If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no
limits, expect others to exercise 'freedom of action.'”

Even though several groups were part of #OpFrance, the Middle East Cyber Army was particularly active
and did the majority of the defacements. This group includes members that belong to other hacking
groups such as Anonymous Arabe and some hackers from North Africa.
It is worth noting that one suspected member of the Middle East Cyber Army was arrested several months
after the January – March #OpFrance campaign. The Bulgarian police arrested a 21-year-old Syrian
student residing in Bulgaria, believed to be the leader of the group11. Based on the defacement pages of
Middle East Cyber Army, the hacker with the alias "The Greatest" was arrested. The group modified their
defacement pages to include #OPSaveTheGreatest after the arrest.

Indian Border Disputes Trigger Campaigns
Like Israel, India has unresolved territorial disputes with its neighbors and sees frequent clashes along its
borders. The unresolved dispute with Pakistan regarding Kashmir and Jammu, as well as the challenges
of patrolling and enforcing the border between India and Bangladesh (the fifth longest land border in the
world), makes for a volatile situation. It's further exacerbated by constant defacements between Pakistani
and Indian hacking groups, and between Bangladeshi and Indian hacking groups.

The hackers targeted Indian websites, as evidenced by the TLD's .in, ac.in, co.in, org.in, edu.in and gov.
being in the top nine domains with websites defaced.

Cricket leads to #riseofthetigers
Even cricket teams became a trigger for defacement campaigns, illustrating the degree of tension between
India and its two neighbors.
The campaign #OpIndia started on March 2015, executed by Bangladeshi hackers, after Indian politician
Shashi Tharoor tweeted that he preferred to face the Bangladesh cricket team (called The Tigers) in the
Cricket World Cup quarterfinals. Tharoor reportedly felt Bangladesh was a weaker team that would give
India an easier path to the finals.

Free Kashmir
Led by Pakistani hacking groups ZCompany Hacking Crew (ZHC) and Muslim Liberation Army, Free
Kashmir is a long-standing campaign that started in 2011. The attacks began with the calling out of the
illegal occupation and human rights abuses the Indian Armed Forces committed against Kashmiris12.
Free Kashmir has the most number of defacements out of all the campaigns studied, despite having only
around half the number of attackers that #OpIsrael had.

26 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Pakistan is India's rival claimant to the disputed territory of Kashmir, and the defacement pages of both
ZHC and Muslim Liberation Army commonly quote India's Penal Code Act No. 45 of 1860, which does
not include the State of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India. However, the ruler of Jammu and Kashmir,
Maharaja Hari Singh, acceded both territories to India in 194713.

Figure 24. Free Kashmir campaign defacements

The messages of ZHC and the Muslim Liberation Army have a Pakistani slant and do not necessarily
reflect the sentiments of the Kashmiri people. However, they may gain traction with younger Kashmiris as
ZHC and Muslim Liberation Army also highlight the human rights abuses and disappearances of Kashmiri
activists and militants14, an issue that has not received international attention.

Nationalism Inspires Retaliatory Hacking
It is also quite common for hacking groups in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to start defacement
campaigns against their rival country's websites. The presence of active hacking groups in neighboring,
conflicting countries makes for a volatile situation, and these "turf wars" or "nationalistic defacements"
can easily be triggered, and in a lot of cases, get out of hand.

27 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

One such incident happened in 2015 when a Pakistani hacker named Faisal 1337 hacked into multiple
Indian websites. The government website of the state of Kerala was the most prominent website defaced.

Figure 25. Indian local government websites hacked

Immediately, hacking groups from India launched #op_pak_cyber_space, defacing hundreds of Pakistani
websites in retaliation.

Figure 26. Retaliatory attack from Indian hackers

The defacement of Mumbai Airport Customs website by Pakistani defacer Alone Injector is another
example. After the incident, Indian hackers retaliated with a campaign defacing the websites for Islamabad,
Peshawar, Multan and Karachi airports in Pakistan.

Fallout of the Attacks between India and its Neighbors
Aside from ongoing campaigns by Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi hackers (against or in response to
each other's hacking), the real-world conflict between the three countries has significantly increased in
the past two years.
One event happened on January 2, 2016, when several terrorists attacked India's Pathankot Air Force
base, killing several Indian military men and one civilian. The attack was later claimed and attributed to
Jaish-e-Mohammed, a separatist group in Kashmir15. After the attack, Indian hacking groups retaliated by
targeting Pakistani websites.

Figure 29. Retaliatory defacements made by Team Indian Black Hats aka Indian Cyber Devils

On September 18, 2016, attackers from Jaish-e-Mohammed, the same terror group responsible for the
Pathankot Air Base attack a few months prior, launched another attack on an Indian army headquarters in
Uri that left 17 army members dead, as well as all four attackers16. A few days later, the Indian government
launched surgical strikes targeting locations in Kashmir.
These series of incidents sparked back and forth campaigns between Indian and Pakistani hacking
groups, with defacements containing politically charged messages, freedom slogans, or just plain hate
speech.

30 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 30. Defacements generated by conflict with India

Another event that triggered a sizeable defacement campaign was the drafting of Nepal’s new constitution
in September 2015. Some in India believed that the constitution marginalized certain ethnic groups; an
issue that was highlighted when the Indian Express reported that India requested Nepal to make seven
amendments to its constitution17. The report triggered an outrage in Nepal, as the message was seen as
a foreign country meddling in the internal affairs of an independent sovereignty.
The outrage triggered the #BackOffIndia campaign during October 2015, supported by DQN hacker and
craXerbikash from Nepal, BloodSecurity from the Philippines, and several Pakistani hackers.

Groups behind the Attacks
The most prominent anti-India defacements came from RiseOfTheTigers, a collective that was created just
for the #OpIndia campaign in March 2015. Several Bangladeshi hacking groups joined RiseOfTheTigers:
Bangladesh Grey Hat Hackers, Bangladesh Cyber Army, Team_CC, Bangladesh Script Kiddie Hackers,
Blacksmith Hackers Team, 3xp1re Cyber Army, Bangladesh Black Hat Hackers, and others.

Military Actions prompt a #SaveSyria Campaign
On April 22, 2016, the Syrian government launched airstrikes targeting residential areas in Aleppo during
Friday scheduled prayers. The attacks happened despite a ceasefire agreement by both sides in February
2016. There were several more airstrikes, the worst of which hit the al-Quds hospital, killing 50 people18.
The incident inspired a #SaveSyria campaign that exposed graphic images of wounded civilians in Aleppo.

Figure 33. Targeted domains of #SaveSyria

Most of the #SaveSyria defacements targeted Russian websites because many suspected that Russia
was behind the April 2016 airstrikes. Russia is seen as supportive of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad,
and the country has reinforced Assad's regime through air superiority assets.

Figure 34. Defaced sites showing graphic images of Aleppo

33 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

The Fallaga Team formed a loose collective called the Tunisian Cyber Resistance Al Fallaga Team, composed
of Tunisian hackers and actively supported by hackers from Anonymous Arabe, Algeria, and Indonesia.
They launched a defacement campaign with the hashtags #StopTheHolocaust, #AleppoIsBurning,
#SaveAleppo and #SaveSyria.

Campaigns Provoked by Kosovo Disputes
Kosovo is a disputed territory and partially recognized state that declared its independence from Serbia
in 2008. The majority of its population is of Albanian descent, and the country enjoys friendly relations
with Albania stemming from common history and traditions. In Northern Kosovo, near Serbia, there
are communities of Serbian descent that refuse to acknowledge Kosovo's independence. This tension
reached a boiling point in 2011 when Kosovo Police clashed with ethnic Serbian rioters who refused to
remove roadblocks going into enclaves of Serbian control19.
Albanian hacking groups KSG-CREW, kwgdeface and AlbanianHackers launched the #AntiSerbs
campaign a few months after the initial clashes. The campaign died down before the Brussels Agreement,
which involved the integration of Northern Kosovo into Kosovo and had Kosovo Serbs manning the police
and judiciary, was concluded.

Figure 35. Timeline of anti-Serbs campaign

The defacement pages showed support for Kosovo independence, and also mentioned contested towns
commonly involved in civil unrest. They listed Serbian-controlled territories bordering Kosovo with an
Albanian majority and declared their desire to separate from Serbia and join Kosovo.

Disputes in the South China Sea
OpPhilippines and OpTaiwan
On May 9, 2013, a maritime incident involving the Taiwanese fishing boat Guang Da Xing No. 28 and the
Philippine Coast Guard resulted in the death of Taiwanese fisherman Hung Shih-cheng (洪石成)20. This
incident led to many consequences, including sanctions and a military drill from Taiwan government,
protests in Taiwan, and several cyberattacks.
On May 10, 2013, people in Taiwan called for DDoS attacks against .gov.ph to force the Philippine
government into issuing an official apology. Many hackers responded, attacking more than 30 .gov.ph
sites21.

35 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 37. Forum post mobilizing visitors to launch DDoS attack

On May 11, Filipino hacker "Pinoy Vendetta"22 sent a warning message to Taiwanese hackers by
defacing one Taiwan government site and several commercial sites. In response, AnonTaiwan launched
#OpPhilippines the next day.

36 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 38. Web defacement page from "PinoyVendetta"

After the attack, AnonTaiwan posted leaked data from .gov.ph sites on Pastebin. One noteworthy victim
was dns.gov.ph, which is the .gov.ph domain registry website. More than 2,300 accounts, which were
possible admin accounts for .gov.ph domains, were leaked. These government sites faced a huge risk.
Potentially, attackers could change the name servers of domain names, government domain names would
have resolved to invalid IP addresses, and important sites would have been inaccessible to the public.

37 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 39. Information leaked on Pastebin

On May 25, 2013, Filipino hackers attacked 31 .tw sites in a campaign titled #OpTaiwan as a response to
#OpPhilippines. The defaced pages displayed the messages, "Stop attacking our cyberspace" and "Let
our government handle this problem."

Defacements over Territory
Six countries—China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei—are contesting several islands
and features, rock outcrops, sandbars, and reefs in the South China Sea.
Over the last few years, the tension between China and Vietnam, and China and Philippines has increased.
China has taken aggressive action, from coast guard patrols to building facilities and installations in
various contested areas. This has sparked defacement activities by several groups from Philippines,
Vietnam, and China against their rival countries' websites.

Early Attacks in 2011
Chinese marine surveillance vessels cut the cables of Vietnamese oil survey vessels in the South China
Sea23. This incident triggered defacement attacks that started on June 3, 2011. A Vietnamese defacer
'Mr.N - Cubi11' attacked Chinese government websites. The page displayed Vietnamese patriotic slogans
like "Vietnamese People is Willing to Sacrifice to Protect the Sea, Sky, and Nation." More Vietnamese
defacers joined this campaign after24.

Figure 42. Vietnamese defacer page

From June 4, 2011, Chinese defacers started to retaliate by attacking .vn websites. Hongke Union (HUC),
a well-known Chinese hacktivist group, mobilized its members and launched a series of attacks. Over 30
.gov.vn sites were defaced.

40 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 43. Chinese defacers retaliate

After completing the attacks, the HUC sent out a summary reporting that their attacks were from June 4
to June 5, two function groups were created (one for DDoS, one for defacement), and several QQ chat
groups and YY chat channels were created to coordinate attacks25.
Some non-HUC hackers also joined the attack, compromising over 1,000 sites. Most of the victims
suffered DDoS attacks and defacement. One popular Vietnamese search engine site was inaccessible for
five hours. During the attacks, HUC found Vietnamese defacers attacking .cn sites.
Chinese hacker group Silic also joined the retaliation. In their deface pages, Silic claimed that "(Vietnamese
defacers) first stir up trouble, we just attack back." This group attacked 98 .vn websites on June 8. Most
victims were .gov.vn sites26.

OpChinaDown, 2012
On April 10, 2012, a standoff between the Philippine Navy and Chinese maritime surveillance ships over
the disputed Scarborough Shoal (Huangyan in Chinese) in the South China Sea caused tension between
the two countries. In response, Chinese defacers compromised the website of the University of the
Philippines on April 20, 2012, leaving a message that claimed, “We come from China! Huangyan Island
is Ours”.

42 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 45. Defaced page of University of the Philippines

The defacer group "Anonymous #OccupyPhilippines" responded on the same day, compromising several
.cn sites. The statement "Scarborough Shoal is ours!" was prominent on the deface page27.
Three days later, on April 23, the government of the Philippines claimed that two of its sites suffered DDoS
attacks coming from Chinese IP addresses—an apparent retaliatory attack from China. Defacements
escalated quickly, triggered by the DDoS attacks28.

43 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 46. Page from #OccupyPhilippines

On the same day, OccupyPhilippines and PrivateX launched a joint attack operation "#OpChinaDown".
They attacked .gov.cn sites and posted DB schema and login credentials of victim sites on Pastebin.
On April 25, the Silic group (the same organization that attacked .vn sites in 2011) joined the web
defacement campaign and targeted .gov.ph sites. Besides derogatory statements against Philippine
defacers, the page allowed visitors to leave messages on it. Over the course of 3 hours, over 30 visitors
left messages on the defaced pages29.

44 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 47. Silic defacement page, where you can leave messages

Chinese hacktivism group 1937cn joined the defacement war on June 1, 2012. This group created a very
long deface page to convince viewers to believe in their message. 1937cn spread that page across 173
sites in five days.

StopReclamation and OpChina, 2015
China started reclamation and building on the Spratly archipelago of the South China Sea in April 201530.
This action caused a wave of defacement attacks. BloodSec, a Philippine defacer group, launched a
#StopReclamation campaign on April 26, 2015.

45 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 48. BloodSec defacement page

Tensions escalated a month later. Posting on Pastebin31, defacers from the Philippines and Vietnam
declared the beginning of an #OpChina campaign on May 28, 2015. In the announcement, they called
themselves "the united hackers from the Philippines and Vietnam," aiming to "protest your (China) unjust
actions over the South China Sea". At the end of the announcement, they left a note that read "Expect
us! 5/30/2015".

Figure 49. Joint message from Vietnamese and Filipino hackers, and their defacement pages

This is the first time defacers from the two South East Asian countries united for a common political cause.
A series of attacks hit .cn sites on the date stated in their warning message—August 30, 2015. Most of
the victims were .gov.cn sites. The message left by the group Anonymous Philippines asked the Chinese

46 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

government to "stop the reclamation, do not put or establish any structure in that location." At the same
time, "AnonGhost" from Vietnam put out the message, "Stop the infringements of sovereignty island."

Figure 50. Retaliation from Chinese hackers

On the same day, Chinese defacer team "1937cn" retaliated by defacing .vn sites, and blamed it on the
joint action of defacers from Philippines and Vietnam. 1937cn also claimed that "South China Sea is
China's inherent territory." 1937cn's response was very quick—they likely noted the joint announcement
of the defacers from the Philippines and Vietnam, and carefully prepared the retaliation.

Attacks on Vietnamese Airports, 2016
On July 12, 2016, the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines against
China in an arbitration case about the disputes in the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of
cyberattacks against Vietnam32.
On July 29, 2016, the Chinese hacker group 1937cn attacked two major airports in Vietnam and the
website of Vietnam Airlines33. They defaced the home page with the same page used in 2015 during the
#OpChina defacement campaign. Then the hacker group leaked client information of Vietnam Airlines34.
This was not the first time 1937cn attacked Vietnam Airlines; the group also launched a similar attack on
May 30, 2015.

47 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Figure 51. Client information from Vietnam Airlines

The Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam reported several attacks, supposedly from 1937cn team, on
two Vietnam airports within the same day. The IT system for the check-ins of Vietnam Airlines at Tan Son
Nhat International Airport was attacked and stopped working. The deface page, which was the same
page used on the Vietnam Airlines website, replaced the flight information screens at Noi Bai International
Airport. The speaker system at Noi Bai airport was also compromised by hackers for a few minutes,
during which the speakers broadcast an announcement against territory dispute. According to the Civil
Aviation Administration of Vietnam, the attack caused the delay of 100 flights, affecting thousands of
passengers35.
This incident might hint at future hacktivism trends: to reach a wider audience, hacktivists could potentially
broaden their targets from traditional websites to critical infrastructures such as airports.

48 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Hacking Groups’ Connections and Campaigns
Deface groups are formed by a loose affiliation between hackers. They can be defined as "loose" since
hackers can be affiliated with one or more of these hacking groups, even across territories.

Party, while Virus Noir is affiliated with Moroccan Ethical Hackers, darkshadow-tn with Fallaga Team, and
dr.t3rr0r with Myanmar Noob Hackers. Albania Attacker is affiliated with three other groups—Anonymous
Albania, Arab Warriors Team, and Anonghosts. AnonCoders shows how hackers can also be members of
various groups, and how hackers from different countries can form a group.
Other examples showing the liquidity of group membership are Pakistan's two biggest hacking groups:
ZCompany Hacking Crew and Muslim Liberation Army. Both have fairly large teams; ZCompany Hacking
Crew has at least 30 members, and Muslim Liberation Army has around 26. Below you can see seven
hackers who are members of both groups simultaneously, as we've seen defacements made by both
teams acknowledging the hackers in their defacement pages within the same time frame.

Collectives
Hacking groups can also band together to form bigger groups or collectives. The well-known group
Anonymous is a model for this. They can rightly be considered the biggest hacking collective in the
world based on the numerous hacking groups who identify and associate themselves with the name
“Anonymous”.
On a smaller scale, a collective can be formed simply to support a campaign. Take, for example, the
defacements done by Bangladeshi hackers against Indian websites, triggered by the Cricket World Cup.
The collective Rise of the Tigers was borne out of various Bangladeshi hacking groups working together:
3xp1r3 Cyber Army, Blacksmith Hacker's Team, Cyb3r Command0S, Bangladesh Grey Hat Hackers,
Bangladesh Black HAT Hackers, Cyber Sword and Bangladesh Script Kidde Hackers.

50 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Campaign Recruitment and Tools
Certain individuals or groups loosely organize hacktivism campaigns. They set time frames for a particular
campaign, and even use social media to coordinate and launch these campaigns.

Figure 54. Facebook calendar used to schedule defacement activities

Figure 55. Social media post used to spread templates for defacement scripts

51 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

They use calendar event features like Facebook Events to organize campaigns. They also advertise
campaigns on their team pages and actively recruit other hackers and hacking groups to participate.
Tools, targets, and defacement page templates are also shared openly by those participating in a campaign.

Figure 56. Tools spread through social media and sharing sites

52 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Certain groups also set up team websites to host content, post announcements, and facilitate discussions
through forums. These commonly have sections for tutorials, tools, and kits.

Figure 57. Different community sites hosting forums, downloads, news and more

53 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Auxiliary Activities of
Defacement Groups
Besides tools and defacement templates, these groups also share attack techniques. For example, groups
post hacking tutorials on GitHub and upload tutorial videos to streaming sites.

Figure 58. Tools and tutorials for different hacking activities shared by defacers

54 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Defacers are also contributing to Exploit-DB, which is is an open-source database for sharing exploit codes
and security papers. To find the number of defacers that are also active on Exploit-DB, we compared our
list of known defacers against this list of authors36 from Exploit-DB:

Escalating into Real-World Terrorism Activities
Hackers who participate in defacement and also other forms of hacking can also segue into more serious
crimes, possibly also driven by real-world disputes and political agendas. An example would be the case
of Team P0ison's founder Junaid Hussain (TriCk), who started notable defacements in 2010.

Figure 61. Sample of defaced pages done by TriCk supporting Free Kashmir

Hussain was arrested in 2014 for hacking into Katie Kay's (special advisor to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair) email account and leaking PM Blair's personal information37. After six months in jail, Junaid Hussain
traveled to Syria and joined ISIS. He took the name Abu Hussain al-Britani, and is believed to be the
person behind the hack of U.S. Central Command's Twitter and YouTube accounts. He is also believed to
have been killed in a US air strike in Syria in 201538.

Defaced Sites as Unwitting Infection Sources
Aside from actively committing criminal activities, defacement pages can unwitting carriers of malware
code. In the course of our research, we saw the malware Ramnit distributed through malicious websites
or packaged as fake software installers. Ramnit is an actively developed malware family whose main goal
is to steal banking credentials. It also evolved to include worm propagation capabilities, as well as the
ability to infect files, including HTML files. Ramnit does this by appending a VBscript code at the end of
the HTML file found in the affected machine. The infected HTML file contains code to install a copy of the
Ramnit malware.
Unfortunately, some defacers’ machines were infected by Ramnit and had their web defacement
templates infected to include the malicious VBscript. This, in turn, made their defacement pages unwitting
distributors of the Ramnit malware.

56 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

Based on our records, 9,726 defacements were seen to include the Ramnit VBscript. Below are the top 30
defacers who were infected by Ramnit and had their compromised web defacement pages distribute the
malware. Most of the defacers were either from Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle East and North
Africa or from China. In a serendipitous turn of events, the top defacer that unwittingly spread Ramnit
goes by the nickname "stupid".

Conclusion
As seen in the examples above, real-world conflict can trigger web defacement on a large scale. One event
can lead to a campaign that brings hacking groups together, and large collectives can sustain defacement
campaigns for long periods of time. Most are politically or religiously motivated, and attackers are typically
keen to express fervent patriotism over specific causes. While these web defacement activities seem
relatively benign, it is plausible for defacers to move on to other hacking activities and criminal behavior.

Web Defacements and IoT
Web defacements are going to continue in the foreseeable future, and may even become more prevalent
as more Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connected online.

58 | A Deep Dive into Defacement: How Geopolitical Events Trigger Web Attacks

The above screenshot shows a defaced router control panel, changing the title of the HTML page to "You
hacked from iraq(fb\arakan".
A lot of people may not realize that IoT devices have stripped down versions of web servers that host
their control panels and management consoles. The setup is something that would be relatively easy for
a defacer to exploit and compromise. In the case of the router defacement above, the attacker might not
even have known that he was able to deface a non-traditional/IoT website.
Exploits for vulnerabilities of common web applications or server components are also applicable and
effective on non-traditional/IoT websites. It would be simple for a defacer to transition into compromising
connected IoT devices. With the growing number of IoT devices, it might be appealing for defacers to
continue down that route.

Hacktivism in the Future
There are various vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to deface websites to push their specific agenda.
But despite compromising these web sites that contain potentially sensitive data (PII, account credentials,
transaction histories, etc), most defacers have yet to abuse their access further. They are seemingly
content just to deface the site. However, the delineation between pure web defacement and cybercriminal
or cyberespionage activity is disappearing. Hackers are now increasingly involved in developing web
shells (backdoors to maintain access to compromised web servers), and also delving into doxing and
leaking stolen data. After defacing websites, the next step would seem to be capitalizing on the available
information on compromised sites.
Apart from individuals, defacement groups have yet to monetize their activities. According to our data,
99.9% of the web defacement pages are harmless. Pages found containing malicious code are mostly
infected by VBS_RAMNIT.SMC. These pages were unknowingly infected, and not intentionally put online
to spread malicious code. These defacers had their templates infected by the malware and unwittingly
spread the Ramnit malware.
A troubling scenario is if these defacement groups decide to monetize their successful hacks by, for
example, installing malicious redirections or exploit code in the defacement pages that would then install
ransomware. As previously mentioned, so far these defacements have been benign and motivated by
real-world conflicts or political agendas. However, cybercriminals could easily use hacks for profit-driven
criminal activities.
We have already seen some instances of this. There were reports of Indian hackers targeting Pakistani
servers and users to install ransomware for "patriotic" purposes39. If this continues and escalates, then the
line between defacers, hacktivists, and cybercriminals will become even more blurred.

How can enterprises protect their sites?
Based on the major vulnerabilities used by defacers, there are simple steps
that can secure servers against these threats. If practiced and deployed
consistently, these tips can help enterprises have long-term security:
•

Ensure that basic security policies are employed and maintained longterm: strong passwords, proper administration security policies, and
correct configuration.

•

Use web application firewalls to filter, monitor, and block malicious
traffic. Security is necessary at the web application level.

•

Practice secure coding. Organizations must implement secure coding
standards on all their sites.

•

Regularly use testing tools to ensure deployed codes are secure.

•

Make patching systems and networks a part of standard policy. This
prevents cybercriminals from exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched/
outdated software.

•

Regularly scan web applications for vulnerabilities: Organizations need
to check their web apps for vulnerabilities as these can lead to SQL
injection and cross-site scripting attacks.

•

Use multi-layered protection that secures vulnerable websites from
the common attacks used by defacers. Solutions like Trend Micro™
Deep Security™ and Vulnerability Protection provides virtual patching
that protects servers and endpoints from threats that may abuse
vulnerabilities.
