The emergence of new pathogens capable of infecting novel hosts is a pressing concern in the field of infectious diseases. Here's another interesting fact related to this topic:

The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for HGT to play a role in the emergence of zoonotic diseases. The outbreak involved a spillover event from bats to humans, with subsequent human-to-human transmission. However, during the outbreak, researchers discovered that the virus had undergone genetic changes that may have contributed to its ability to spread more effectively among humans.

Studies showed that the Ebola virus evolved during the outbreak, with mutations that potentially altered the structure of the virus's glycoprotein, which is involved in host cell entry. These changes could have affected how the virus interacted with human cells, possibly making it better adapted to spread within the human population.

The identification of these genetic changes underscores the dynamic nature of viral evolution and the importance of monitoring pathogens for signs of adaptation. It also emphasizes the need for continued research into the mechanisms by which viruses cross species barriers and become established in new host populations. This knowledge is essential for developing strategies to prevent and control future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases.
