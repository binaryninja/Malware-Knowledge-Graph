In recent weeks, security researchers and cyber security vendors have noted an
increase in malvertising campaigns on Google, aimed at infiltrating info-stealer
malware into the systems of unsuspecting victims, as reported in sources [1] [2]. It has
been observed that when individuals search for popular tools such as Notepad++,
Zoom, AnyDesk, Foxit, Photoshop, and others on Google, they may encounter ads
that redirect them to malicious sites. This report aims to provide a high-level analysis
of one such campaign, specifically focusing on the delivery of the Vidar Info-stealer
malware.
Campaign Details
On the 25th of January 2023, Darktrace researchers observed that the advertisement
depicted in Figure 1 was being displayed on Google when searching for the term
"Notepad++" from within the United States.

As can be seen in Figure 2, the advertisement in question had no visible information
regarding its publisher.

Clicking on the advertisement would direct potential victims to the website
notepadplusplus.site, which had been registered on the 4th of January and is hosted on IP
address 37.140.192.11. Upon selecting the desired version of the software, a download
button is presented to the visitor.

When clicking on Download, regardless of the version selected, the traffic is then redirected
to https://download-notepad-plus-plus.duckdns.org/, and a .zip file with name
“npp.Installer.x64.zip” is downloaded.

Figure 5: Traffic redirection
Upon extraction, the file "npp.Installer.x64.exe" has a file size of 684.1 megabytes. The
significant size is attributed to the inclusion of an excessive number of null bytes, which
serve to prevent the file from being scanned by some Antivirus and uploaded to malware
analysis platforms such as VirusTotal, which has a file size limit of 650 megabytes.

Initially, padding was incorporated at the end of the executable, enabling individuals to
remove it while maintaining a fully functional file. However, in the sample analysed in this
report, padding was inserted into the binary's central region. This method renders the
removal of padding more challenging, as simply deleting the zeroes would compromise the
integrity of the file and impede its functionality during dynamic analysis.

After execution, the malware promptly establishes a connection to a Telegram channel to
acquire its command and control (C2) address, specifically http://95.217.16.127. If Telegram
is not available, the malware will then attempt to connect to a profile on video game platform
Steam, in which case the C2 address was http://157.90.148.112/ at the time of initial analysis
and http://116.203.6.107 later. It then proceeds to check-in and obtain its configuration file
and subsequently downloads get.zip, an archive containing several legitimate DLL libraries,
which are utilized to extract information and saved passwords from various applications and
browsers. Through traffic analysis, the method by which the malware obtains its Command
and Control (C2) location, and analysis of the configuration obtained, it can be assessed with
high confidence that the malware in question is the info-stealer known as Vidar. Vidar has
been extensively covered by various cybersecurity organizations. Further information
regarding this info-stealer and its origins can be found here[3].

Campaign ID 827
8/11

The domain download-notepad-plus-plus.duckdns.org, from which the malware is distributed,
resolves to the IP address 185.163.204.10. Using passive DNS, it has been determined that
multiple domains also resolve to this IP address. This information suggests that the threat
group responsible for this campaign is also utilizing advertising to target individuals
searching for specific applications besides Notepad++, including:
OBS Studio
Davinci Resolve
Sqlite
Rufus
Krita
Furthermore, it has been observed that all the malware samples obtained in this investigation
connect to the same Telegram channel, utilize the same two Command and Control IP
addresses, and share the same campaign ID of "827".

Conclusion
The recent proliferation of malvertising campaigns, which are employed by cyber-criminals to
distribute malware, has become a significant cause for concern. Unlike more traditional
infection vectors, such as email, malvertising is harder to protect against. Furthermore, the
use of padding techniques to inflate the size of malware payloads can make detection and
analysis more challenging.
To mitigate the risk of falling victim to such attacks, it is recommended to exercise caution
when interacting with online advertisements. Specifically, it is advisable to avoid clicking on
any advertisements while searching for free software on search engines and to instead
download programs directly from official sources. This approach can reduce the likelihood of
inadvertently downloading malware from untrusted sources.
Another effective measure to counteract the threat of malicious ads is the utilization of adblocker software. The implementation of an ad-blocker can provide an additional layer of
protection against malvertising campaigns and enhance overall cybersecurity.
