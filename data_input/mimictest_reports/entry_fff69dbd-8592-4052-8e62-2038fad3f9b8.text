Trend Micro researchers discovered a new ransomware that abuses the APIs of a legitimate tool called Everything, a Windows filename
search engine developed by Voidtools that offers quick searching and real-time updates for minimal resource usage. This ransomware (which
we named Mimic based on a string we found in its binaries), was first observed in the wild in June 2022 and targets Russian and Englishspeaking users. It is equipped with multiple capabilities such as deleting shadow copies, terminating multiple applications and services, and
abusing Everything32.dll functions to query target files that are to be encrypted.
In this blog entry, we will take a closer look at the Mimic ransomware, its components and functions, and its connection to the Conti builder that
was leaked in early 2022.
Arrival and components
Mimic arrives as an executable that drops multiple binaries and a password-protected archive (disguised as Everything64.dll) which when
extracted, contains the ransomware payload. It also includes tools that are used for turning off Windows defender and legitimate sdel binaries.
